1. Our Pennant flutters in the breeze,
  Our home is on the sea;
Where wind may blow and billow flow,
  No limits to the free.
No limits to the free, my boys,
  Let wind and wave waft on,
The boundless world of waters,
  Is my merry men our own.

CHORUS [sung after VERSEs 1-3]
No limits to the free, my boys,
  Let wind and wave waft on,
The boundless world of waters, is
  My merry men our own.

2. One mute farewell, one look, as where
  The blue sky meets the foam,
Headland and Isle fast fade the while,
  Then proudly greet our home.
Through wind and wave we’ve hearts to brave
  The battle and the wreck;
For ocean is the Sailor’s grave,
  His heritage the deck.

3. Or be it East, or be it West,
  Or to the Pole or Line,
So, free, like Sea bird to her rest,
  Our fleet ship cleaves the brine;
Our fleet ship cleaves the brine, my boys,
  As now, with stun’ sails square
And royals light, she seems to quit
  Her element of air.

4. Cheerily, cheerily, my merry, merry men,
  For merry, merry men are we,
From sun to sun still roving on,
  As the breeze that wafts us free.
As the breeze that wafts us free, my boys,
  My merry, merry men and true,
Where wind may roam or billows foam,
  Our native land adieu.

CHORUS [sung after VERSE 4]
Adieu, adieu our native land,
  Our native land adieu,
Adieu, adieu our native land,
  Our native land adieu.
