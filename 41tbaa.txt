1. A little boy went out to shoot one day, 
And carried his arrows and bow; 
For guns they are dangerous things for play, 
In the hands of little children you know. 
A little bird sat in a cherry tree 
And whistled and said, “you can’t shoot me.”

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Cuckoo, Cuckoo, Cuckoo, 
Cuckoo, Cuckoo!

2. “Just wait,” says the boy, “till I get close enough,
  And see if I don’t shoot you through!” 
“Do you think,” says the bird “I’m not up to snuff,
  To sit and be shot at by you?” 
“I thank you, you’er rather too kind, sir, 
And arrow is not to my mind, sir.

3. The little boy raised his arrow to his eye,
  And aimed it right straight for a while;
The little bird laughed and away he did fly,
  Saying “a miss is as good as a mile.”
The little boy threw down his arrrow and cried.
The little bird laughed till it almost died.

[4.]
MORAL. Now listen, kind sirs, when e’er you sit down
  To court a fair maiden so shy:
Pray don’t let her know   what you are about,
  Or else she will certainly fly;
But set your snares with a lover’s art.
And then you may laugh when you’re caught by her heart.
