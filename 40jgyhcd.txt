De hawk flew down and hit de goose
He hit de ole hen in de back

2.
As I was gwain lond de road,
Past a stump dar wad a toad.
De tadpole winked at Pollewog's daughter,
And kick'd de bull frog plump in de water.

  Oh, Jenny get de hoe cake done, love!

3.
High heel boot widout any strap,
Hand me down my leghorn hat,

And old hawk flew down amongst de pack,
And struck the old hen whack [amidlle?] ob de hack,
And I really do believe dat tis a fact.

Dare is no music like de old banjo,
And if you want to hear it ring,
Jist watch this finger on de string.
  Oh, Jenny get de hoe cake done my dear,
  Oh, Jenny get de hoe cake done, love!
