1.
On the grassy slopes of a distant clime,
In the silent night and the olden time,
When a brightness told of the angel throng,
What was the first sweet Christmas song?

CHORUS [sung after each verses 1 and 2]
Glory to God in the highest,
On earth peace, good will tow'rd men?
Glo- ry to God in the highest,
On earth peace, good will tow'rd men!

2.
When the wise men came by the starry beams,
While the hushed earth lay in the realm of dreams,
When they lowly knelt at the manger shrine,
What was their thought, by the Child divine?

3.
When the wise now come at the tender call,
To the feet of Him who has died for all;
When they name His name­­ when their gifts they bring,
What is the Christmas song they sing?

CHORUS after last verse
Glory to God in the highest,
On earth peace, good will tow'rd men!
