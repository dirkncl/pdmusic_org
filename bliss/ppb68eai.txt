1.
The house that you see un-der-neath the great pine,
With walls that are paint-ed and doors that are fine,
And mead-ows and corn-fields a-round it are mine,
And mead-ows and corn-fields a-round it are mine.

2.
There on the side-hill of the wood-land close by,
In_a house that is not half so wide or so high
E-li-jah, my mil-ler, lives, rich-er than I,
E-li-jah, my mil-ler, lives, rich-er than I.

3.
'Tis good in his blue eyes the twink-le to see,
That_the mill may go wrong nev-er troub-les his glee;
'Tis I that must pay for the mend-ing, not he,
'Tis I that must pay for the mend-ing, not he.

4.
He laughs when I frown, and he hums when I sigh
The pleas-ant love dit-ties of days that are by;
Now who is the rich-er, E-li-jah or I?
Now who is the rich-er, E-li-jah or I?
