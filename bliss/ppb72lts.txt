1. 
’Tis night o’er the moorland, and fierce is the blast, 
And frail is the bridge o’er the river; 
And hurried the prayer when a step here or there, 
May send a soul home to the Giver; 
But brightly a wa’ thro’ the sleet and the snaw, 
Light breaks o’er the darkness revealing, 
The path o’er the stream for the star of my dream, 
My Jessie has lighted the shealing.

CHORUS
Lighted the shealing­­ my bonnie wee wife: 
Lighted the path o’er the river, 
Lighting wi’ smiles a’ the path o’ my life 
My ain winsome Jessie foriver.

2. 
I fear na’ the chill in the breath o’ the blast, 
As gaily I bound o’er the heather; 
A race wi’ the wind and the danger a’ passed, 
We sit by the ingle thegither. 
We dream o’er the future and smil o’er the past, 
Nor ken but the present is dealing, 
Sic bliss as the heaven’s we pray for at last, 
Wi Jessie lovelighting the shealing.

3. 
How pleasant to think o’ the days that will flit, 
Like sunlight and shade o’er the heather; 
’Tho’ sorrow maun enter, I dinna forget 
’Tis sweet when we share it thegither. 
Oh, may the gude Father then answer the prayer, 
I iver will ask at my kneeling, 
Whate’er he take frae me in mercy but spare 
My Jessie to lovelight the shealing.
