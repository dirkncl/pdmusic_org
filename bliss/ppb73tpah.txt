No cloud no storm,
All peace and harmony.

Beg pardon, sir, I called to say,
You have a little tax to pay;
Be calm, dear sir, pray do not frown,

Here's State tax, School tax, County, town;
[Professor.(politely.)]
Very well, please call again, now do
Perhaps within a week or two.
[Professor and Tax Collector.]
I will not call again on you,
(Very well, please call again, now do,)
I've waited now a week or two.
(Perhaps within a week or two.)

By your appointment, sir, I'm here
To sing with you although I fear
"Te sol quest an i ma" will be
Quite out of time with what I hear!

I sing my part with greatest ease.
