1. 
“Boys are wanted”­­ so they say,
Boys are wanted ev’ry day.
Boys are wanted, “we will pay
Cash for boys.”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]]
Boys are wanted, brave and true;
Boys of mind and muscle, too.
Boys who dare the right to do,
Faithful Boys.

2. 
Boys are wanted here and there,
Boys who will for work prepare;
Boys are wanted ev’rywhere­­
Willing boys.

3. 
Boys to handle hoe and spade,
Boys to bend who’re not afraid,
Boys to follow any trade­­
Business boys.

4. 
Boys of speech and boys of song,
Boys to righten many a wrong,
Boys to help the world along­­
Noble boys.

5. 
Boys the busy world employs
Boys, and not selfacting toys,
Boys are wanted, real boys,
Boys, boys, boys.
