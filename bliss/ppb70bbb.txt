1.
We come with reversed arms, O comrades who sleep,
To rear the proud marble -- to muse and to weep.
Speak of the dark days that yet had their joys,
When we were together -- Brave Battery Boys,
When we were together -- Brave Battery Boys.

CHORUS
Ho! Kennesaw Mountain, Ho! Franklin, declare
What soldiers for Freedom can do an can dare;
Loud peans of praise each patriot employs,
To tell how they triumphed -- Brave Battery Boys,
To tell how they triumphed -- Brave Battery Boys.

2.
Our hearts will recall them, the scenes where ye bled,
Where life rushed away in the torrent of red;
When Mission Ridge echoed the battle's fierce joys,
When rushed to the rescue -- Brave Battery Boys,
When rushed to the rescue -- Brave Battery Boys.

(CHORUS)

3.
We may not live over each glory-crown'd day,
When bravely ye battled and won in the fray;
When Proudly ye sported the grand battle toys,
And fell but as victors, Brave Battery Boys,
And fell but as victors, Brave Battery Boys,

(CHORUS)

4.
We come, O! beloved to garland your tomb,
To twine 'round the marble the spring's freshest bloom;
To Speak of a past that no Present destroys,
And call the dead roll of Brave Battery Boys,
And call the dead roll of Brave Battery Boys.

(CHORUS)

5.
O! brave Twenty-Six, when the weary shall rest,
When over our slumbers the sod shall be prest;
When Sweetly forgetful of all that annoys,
We'll sleep here together, Brave Battery Boys,
We'll sleep here together, Brave Battery Boys.

(CHORUS)
