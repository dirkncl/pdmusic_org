1. [sung as Quartet, then a Chorus]
Wake up, sweet melody!
Now is the hour
When young and loving hearts
Feed most thy power.

[1st ending]
One note of music by Moonlight’s soft ray—
Oh, ’tis worth thousands heard coldly by day.
Then

CHORUS [sung twice, as well as (3.) Last Time]
Wake up, sweet melody!
Now is the hour
When young and loving hearts
Feed most thy power.

2. [sung as a Quartet, then a Chorus]
Ask the fond nightingale,
When his sweet flower,
Loves most to hear his song
In her green bower?

[2nd ending]
Oh, he will tell thee through 
Summer nights long,
Fondest she lends her whole
Soul to his song.
