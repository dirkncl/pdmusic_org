To Mrs. O. Blackman.
"Bessie Lee" (7 July 1871)
The Highland Lassie.
(Scotch Ballad)
Words by Rev. Robert Lowie, Washington, D. C.
Music by Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876

1.
Ye sunny banks and bonnie braes,
Hae monie a daisey fair;
But fairest o' them a' is she,
The bonnie lass o' Ayr.

[CHORUS]
The soaring laverock's early note,
Among the braes sae free,
Has na the music, like the song
Of bonnie Bessie Lee.

2.
My Bessie has sich saucy curls,
And lily hand sae wee;
And danger's in the ilka glance,
Of bonnie Bessie Lee.

[CHORUS]
For a' the treasure Princes hae,
I wad na', wad na' gie,
The daisy of the Highland, O,
My bonnie Bessie Lee.
