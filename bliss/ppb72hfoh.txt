1.
I'm waiting by the wagon,
  My heart is lone and sore;
I'm weeping for my "Dobbin",
  His weary life is o'er,
We've jogged along together
  Thro' many journeys past,
But now we lay the harness by,
  We've _turned him out_ at last.

CHORUS
*Whoa _Dobin_, Whoa!
  The wint'ry winds do blow,
And seem to say,
  As well they may,
*"Whao, Dobbin, Whao."

2.
Down in her stable yonder,
  I see my faithful "Fan";
I leave my morning paper
  To save _her_ if I can,
In gentle tones I murmur,
  Dear _Fannie_ won't you stay?
She sadly shakes her drooping head
  And ho(a)rsely answers "neigh"!

CHORUS
*Whoa! _Fannie_, Whoa!
  How can I let you go?
Though old and blind,
  You're true and kind,
*"Whao, Fannie, Whao!"

3.
Old "Dobbin" has departed,
  And faithful "Fannie", too,
And now, my gentle "Jennie",
  I fondly turn to you;
Cheer up! for by their mem'ry
  Who served and suffered so,
Such deadly draught and weary toil
  Your neck shall never know!

CHORUS
*Whoa _Jennie_, Whoa!
  Your load shall lighter grow;
So let me prove
  my tender love,
*Whao, Jennie, Whao."

* In the first and second verses pronouce _Wo_.
