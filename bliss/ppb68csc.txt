Hark to the street-cries in the noisy city!
Louder and louder they fall upon the ear.
"Right this
[2]
way, Sir,' 'Take a carriage?'
'Apples, peanuts, cakes and pies!"
Oh, here's your sweet oranges!"
'The Adams House close by!'
'Bring out your
[3]
ole clo!'
'Here's your fresh fish!'
Fire! Fire! Fire!'

'Trib-e-une--- Times, Eve-nine Jine-'l---
five-o-clock!' 'Straw-aw-aw!'
[5]
'P'lice P'lice! P'lice! P'lice'
'Burlington an' Quincy cars!'
'Auction! auction!' 'Milk below!'

'Can you tell me, Sir, when the ten-o-clock train goes?'
'Mister, black your boots?'
'O, I've lost my watch!' 'Hurry up!'
