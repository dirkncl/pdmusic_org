1. With hopes and with viols, there stand a great throng
In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song:—

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Unto Him who hath loved us and washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory forever, Amen.

2. All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight,
Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite.

3. He maketh the rebel a priest and a king.
He hath brought us and taught us this new song to sing.

4. How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,
If He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin.

5. Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
So that others believing, this new song shall sing.
