"The ELOPEmeant" (1874)
Ballad.
["The Elopement", (Comic)]
from "Songs for Parlor and Professional Singing"
Words and Music by Pro Phundo Basso.
[psuedonym of Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876]

1.
"No, no, no!" her mother said,
To my earnest pleading;
Shut her eyes, and shook her head,
While my heart was bleeding;
Told me plainly,
I sued vainly,
All my tears unheeding.

2.
"Take this note, my little man,
To my lady's bower;
So I'll free her, if I can,
From her mother's power;
By elopement,
Shy elopement,
At the midnight hour."

3.
Swiftly came the answer, too;
"Smooth ran true love's never;
I am pinning, love, for you;
Nothing shall us sever;
Yes, I'll meet you,
Fondly greet you,
Dearest, _yours, forever._"

4.
Softly through the gate I stole,
Soon there came another;
Ah, what rapture thrilled my soul!
Bliss I could not smother;
Soon I spied her--
Soon beside her--
"Darling" -- _'twas her mother!
