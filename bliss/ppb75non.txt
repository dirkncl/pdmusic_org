1. The message of salvation,
  To all this world make known;
The only sure foundation,
  Is Christ, the Cornerstone.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
No other name is given,
  No other way is known;
Tis Jesus Christ, the first and last,
  He saves, and He alone.

2. One only door of heaven,
  Stands open wide today;
One sacrifice is given,
’Tis Christ, the Living Way.

3. My only song and story,
  Is “Jesus died for me.”
My only hope of glory,
  The cross of Calvary.
