1. Ah, my heart is heavy laden,
Weary and oppressed!
“Come to Me,” saith One, “and coming,
Be at rest!”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
“Come to me,” saith One, “and coming,
Be at rest!”

2. Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide?
“In His feet and hands are woundprints,
And His side.”

3. Is there diadem, as monarch,
That His brow adorns?
“Yes, a crown in very surety,
But of thorns!”

4. If I find Him, if I follow,
What’s my portion here?
“Many a sorrow, many a conflict,
Many a tear.”

5. If I still hold closely to Him,
What have I at last?
“Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,
Jordan past!”

6. If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?
“Not till earth and not till heaven
Pass away!”
