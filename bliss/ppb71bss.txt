1. 
She rocked the cradle to and fro, 
She murmured lovingly and low, 
“Oh sleep, my baby, sleep!” 
The little face was drawn with pain. 
The baby could not hear the strain 
The mother sang and sang, again, 
“Oh sleep my baby, sleep.”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then sleep, baby, sleep, sleep, baby, sleep.
The mother sang and sang again, 
“Oh, sleep, my baby, sleep, 
Sleep, baby, baby sleep.
Sleep, baby sleep, baby, sleep. 

2. 
The Savior lent a list’ning ear, 
And heard the mother singing here, 
“Oh sleep, me baby, sleep!” 
He sent an angel pure and bright, 
To take the babe to worlds of light; 
He whispered “Thou shalt sleep tonight, 
Yes, sleep my baby, sleep.”

3. 
The mother kissed the smiling face, 
And said, “Dear Jesus, in thy grace, 
Thou gav’st my baby, sleep; 
Now, all I ask is when I die, 
My babe may be an angel nigh 
To lead me to the world on high; 
Then blessed were such sleep.”
