1.
The temp'rance ship is sailing on,
   Sailing on,
   Sailin on,
The temp'rance ship is sailing on,
 Tho' angry billows roar,
To bless the world she's sailing on,
   Sailing on,
   Sailing on,
To bless the world she's sailing on,
 To reach a fairer shore.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, rally, freemen, rally!
Do you hear the fearful cry!
'Tis the solemn wail of warning
from the drunkard doomed to die;
'Tos the prayer of wife and mother,
'tis the shriek of anquish wild,
"Will you help a falling brother,
will you save my darling child?
Will you save my darling child?"

2.
The mountain waves are rolling high,
   Rolling high,
   Rolling high,
The mountain wave are rolling high,
 The pirate fleet is strong,
We call for men to do or die,
   Do or die,
   Do or die,
We call for men to do or die,
 To crush the mighty wrong.

3.
Arise, young man for you must fight,
   You must fight,
   You must fight,
Arise, young man for you must fight,
 A foe that seems a friend,
The well worn way that seemeth right,
   Seemeth right,
   Seemeth right,
The well worn way that seemeth right,
 Alas! in death doth end.

4.
Ho, friends of temp'rance, firmly stand,
   Firmly stand,
   Firmly stand,
Ho, friends of temp'rance, firmly stand,
 To meet the daring foe.
For God, for Truth, for Native Land,
   Native Land,
   Native Land,
For God, for Truth, for Native Land,
 We dare to strike the blow.

5.
We see the blinded ruch along,
   Rush along,
   Rush along,
We see the blinded ruch along,
 The broad and downward way.
Then raise at least a prayer or song,
   Prayer or song,
   Prayer or song,
Then raise at least a prayer or song,
 To save them while we may.
