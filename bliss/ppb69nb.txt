1. The day had faded into night,
The moon was in the sky;
And here and there across the heav’ns
While clouds went flitting by.
She turned her weary head to us,
And gazed with restless eye;
And from her little heaving breast,
There flutter’d up a sigh.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
O, Nellie, dear Nellie!
Not lost, but “gone before;”
We shall fold thee again in a long embrace,
Wben we meet on the “Golden Shore.”

2. The mother, by her dying child,
Repeated softly there,
Suppressing all the mother’s woe,
One blessed Savior’s prayer;
And when her infant lips gave back,
The words so sweetly clear,
I knew the waiting angel band
Was listening to hear.

3. But soon we saw that longing look,
And felt the grave had won;
We knew then what it was to say,
“O God, Thy will be done!”
And just as gentle, just as pure
As her young life had been,
She pass’d away, and never knew
The blighting curse of sin.
