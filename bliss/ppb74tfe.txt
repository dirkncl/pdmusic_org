"The Faithful Engineer" (1874)
Words & Music by Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876

Sing him a song
Cheer him along,
Leaving the laurels where laurels belong,
Shockingly queer,
But ne'er did I hear,
A song for the Rail-Road Engineer,
On, and on, and on he goes,
Never a doubt or danger knows,
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer.
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer.

Lives that are dearest, treasures untold,
Firm in the grasp of his hand doth he hold;
Dashing along,
This is his song,
"He that is true, may ever be bold,
He that is true may ever be bold."
On, and on, and on he goes,
Never a doubt or danger knows,
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer;
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer.

Anon, perchance,
His lightning glance
A warning flash revealed
The signal past,
"All right" at last,
What joy his great heart feels!

Men may sleep,
Women may weep,
Stars shine out or burning sun,
Yet must he,
Watchful be,
Calm and storm to him are one.
On, and on, and on he goes,
Never a doubt or danger knows,
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer,
King of the Road, he's nothing to fear,
Ho, for the Faithful Engineer.
