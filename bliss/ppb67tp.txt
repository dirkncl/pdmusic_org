1.
[HUSBAND]
Oh, what a pretty picture, dear,
Your likeness darling Lou
'Twill make you jealous, yet, I fear,
It is so much like you!
[WIFE]
A pretty picture! really!
I'd know if I should see,
But, if 'tis very pretty, why,
It can't look much like me!

DUET. to be sung after 1st and 3rd verses.
[WIFE]
Not at all like me, not at all like me.
Oh the likeness I don't see,
Tho' 'tis true, tho' 'tis bright, tho' 'tis beautiful,
Tho' 'tis true, tho' 'tis bright, tho' 'tis beautiful,
Oh, 'tis not, 'tis not at all like me.
[HUSBAND]
'Tis like you, as all can see, 'tis like you, as all can see,
Oh, the likeness you must see
So true, so bright, so bright so beautiful,
So true, so bright, so bright so beautiful,
'Tis like you as all can see.

2.
[HUSBAND]
Oh, you my dear 'tis true as life,
And art can do no more,
It is so very much like you.
I've kiss'd it o'er and o'er.
[WIFE]
Ha, ha, 'tis poon--the likeness, sir,
I do not quite discern;
But tell me, can you e'er say
It kiss'd you in return?

3.
[HUSBAND]
The picture kiss'd me! now my dear
You surely are in fun,
For though I kiss it o'er and o'er,
It never pays me one.
[WIFE]
Ha, then you're wrong, I've caught you now,
And you will quite agree,
That if it never kisses back,
'Tis not at all like me.

(DUET)
