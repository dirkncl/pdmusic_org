To My Sister
"Mr Lordly and I; or, The Difference" (7 May 1866)
A Parody on "Mrs. Lofty & I"
by Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876

1.
Mister Lordly keeps a "wallet," so do I.
He has piles of "Greenbacks" in it, none have I.
He's no happier with his "coppers," than I am
With my little _empty_ "wallet" light and dry.
I hide my purse lest he should see
The empty thing and pity me.

2.
His fine wife has dainty fingers, mine has not.
But she gives him "curtain lectures," mine does not.
He goes home and gets a scolding, I a kiss.
She a frown, but mine a smile and perfect bliss.
She rules his house, her rights demands
And holds "possession" in her hands.

3.
Mister Lordly has his failings, so have I;
But he wears his in his bosom, outside I.
He will leave the world his money, by and by.
I shall leave my friends my mem'ry when I die.
He's worlds of wealth, his own to call.
I've Love and Hope, and that is all.

4.
He has those that court his favor, none have I;
But I've wondrous satisfaction, glad am I.
I'd not change it for his millions, no not I.
We must both "return our income" by-and-by;
Then pray what diff'rence will there be
'Twixt Mister Lordly's self and me.
