Smile, lovingly smile,
Smile, lovingly smile;
Bright sun, oh smil on me,
Bright sun, on me.
Dispel the darkness, doubt, and fear,
And warm, with love, and hope, and cheer
My heart and my beautiful tree,
My heart and my beautiful tree.
Bright sun, oh, smile on me.

Fall, tenderly fall,
Cool raindrops, fall on me;
Fall, tenderly fall,
Cool raindrops, fall on me.

Refresh the dry and thrirsty earth,
And bless with budding beauty's birth.
My heart and my beautiful tree,
My heart and my beautiful tree, oh,

Breathe, tunefully breathe,
Soft zephyr, breathe on me,
Soft zephyr, breath on me;
To me let purer strains be borne,
Till fruits of holier life adorn
My heart and my beautiful tree,
My heart and my beautiful tree.
Soft zephyr, breathe on me.
