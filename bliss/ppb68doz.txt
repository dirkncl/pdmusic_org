"Daughter of Zion" (9 June 1868)
by Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876

[Chicago: Root & Cady;
from pages 345-347 of
"The Triumph" by George F. Root]

[DUET: Soprano and Alto]
Daughter of Zion from the dust,
Exalt thy fallen head;
Again in thy Redeemer trust,
He calls thee, he calls thee, he calls thee from the dead;
He calls thee, he calls thee, he calls thee from the dead.

[DUET: Tenor and Base]
Awake! awake, put on thy strength--
Thy beautiful, thy beautiful array;
The day of freedom dawns at length, the Lord's appointed day.
The day of freedom dawns at length, the Lord's appointed day.

[CHORUS]
They come, they come, thine exiled bands,
Where'er they rest or roam,
Have heard thy voice in distant lands,
And hasten hasten to their home.
Thus, tho' departed joys we mourn,
And doubts and fears annoy;
With songs (With songs,) with songs, (with songs,)
the ransom'd shall return, (with songs,)
And everlasting joy, (with songs,)
And everlasting joy, (with songs,)
And everlasting joy,
With songs and everlasting joy.
With songs, with songs of joy,
with songs of joy, with songs of joy.
