1.
With a bright winning smile I remember,
And a glance of her witching eye so blue,
Like a soft sunny day in December,
To my life came my loving little Lou,
And the dim future way seemed to brighten,
And life's daily duties dearer, dearer grew,
And my lone weary heart seemed to lighten,
At the thought of my loving little Lou.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
And to day with my darling here beside me,
With her loving heart so noble, kind and truem
I can battle with the sorrows that betide me,
For the sake of my loving little Lou.

2.
Softly down on a calm summer even,
Shone the stars from the distant dome of blue;
But a light brighter far had been given
To the ey of my loving little Lou.
As I told her the old simple story,
To my heart her, form I nearer, nearer, drew;
Just a tear and a smile bright with glory,
Then I called her my darling little Lou.

3.
Many years, happy years have departed,
Many friends, faithful friends are lost to view;
But can I ever bow broken hearted,
While I'm blest with my loving little Lou.
No, the dream of the past stealing o'er me
Gives the present all the fairer, fairer hue,
While the bright furure smiles are before me,
With the life of my loving little Lou.
