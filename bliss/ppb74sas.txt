1. 
[SIRE]
Farewell, my son, if thee must go 
To find a western home, 
Thy father’s blessings follow thee, 
Tho’ far thy feet may roam. 
Thee was a frail and feeble lad­­ 
How soon to manhood grown! 
Now I  am feeble, failing too;
’Tis hard to stay alone,
’Tis hard, ’tis hard to stay alone.

2. 
[SON]
Good cheer! my sire, a year or two,
And you my home will share,
In peace and comfort spend your days
Without a want or care.
Old neighbor Williams’ letter says
That he is well to do,
And gives consent to my request
About his daughter Sue.
Good cheer! my sire a year or two,
And you my home will share,
In peace and comfort spend your days
Without a want or care.

3. 
[SIRE]
’Tis well, my son, long since I mind
Another brighteyes maid­­
How like thy mother’s is that smile­­
But now I’m sore afraid
Thee’ll hardly find a place for me;
A year! how long ’twill be!­­
My son I may not need thy care,
God bless thy home and thee,
God bless, God bless thy home and thee.

4. 
[DUET, SIRE and SON]
Farewell, my sire|son, tho’ miles away,
For thee my prayers shall rise,
That heav’n may cheer life’s fleeting hours,
And peace illume thy skies;
My heart to thee will fondly turn
Wheree’er|ev my|or feet|thee may roam;
And by and by we’ll meet again,
My sire,|son, we’ll meet at home,
My sire,|son, we’ll meet at home,
We’ll meet, we’ll meet at home.
