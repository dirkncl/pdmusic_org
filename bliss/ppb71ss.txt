Sweetly, softly at the midnight,
Floating through the silent air,
Music mingles with the moonlight,
Bourne by zephyrs from afar;

[BASS]
Oh, how thrilling! yet so faintly
That no word the music hears,

[TENOR]
'Tis the distant echoes only,
Angels singing 'mong the stars.

[SOPRANO + ATB]
We are coming, weary watch,
Angels from the crystal shore,
And we'll sweetly sing together
When your gloomy night is o'er.

[SOPRANO]
Fainter, fainter, grew the echoes,
Dimmer shone the silent stars,
Bluer grew the liquid ether,
Heaven closed its golden bars.

[SOPRANO & ALTO]
They had entered through the portals,
Of the jeweled pearly dome.
And the song was lost to mortals,
For the angels were at home.

[SATB]
They had entered through the portals,
Of the jeweled pearly dome.
And the song was lost to mortals,
For the angels were at home,
Yes, the angels were at home.
