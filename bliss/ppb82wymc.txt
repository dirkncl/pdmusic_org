1.
"Wish you merry Chistmas!"
Hark the joyous song;
How the cheerful voices
Roll the notes along!

Happy hearts responding
To the welcome call,
"Wish you merry Christmas,
merry Christmas, all!"

DUET after each verse
Let our sweetest numbers flow,
Wake the heav'nly song again,
Sung by angels long ago,
"Peace on earth, good will to men."

2.
"Wish you merry Christmas!"
Merry Christmas all;
May the richest blessings
Ever on you fall;
Ev'ry year be brighter
Than the one before,
And your Christmas mornings
Many, many more.

CODA [2 times]
Merry, merry, merry, merry,
merry, merry, merry, merry,
merry, merry, Christmas all.
