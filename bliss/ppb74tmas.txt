Irish Song.
by Pro Phundo Basso.
[psuedonym of Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876]

1.
Och, list to my sorryfull song;
For matthers is all goin wrongp;
  And shure I must shpake,
  Or me heart it will break,
An' I'll not be detainin ye long.
Bad luck to Miss Kittie McKay!
She's taken me sinses away
  Sayin "Monny a shlip
  Twixt the cup and the lip"--
Ah there's monny a shlip, now, they say.

CHORUS
There's monny, there's monny, there's monny a shlip,
There's monny a shlip they say,
There's monny, there's monny a shlip 'twixt the cup and the lip,
There's monny a shlip they say.

2.
Ah, Kittie was nate as ye plaze,
Faith she could make butter and chaze,
  She minded the pig,
  And the praties she'd dig
In sich illegant ladylike ways.
I bot me a rake and a shpade,
A gim of a gairden I made,
  "Coom tind it," I said,
  But she shook her swate head
And I'm wonderfull sorry indade.

(CHORUS)

3.
My shanty I plashtered wid mud,
And I shtop'd all the howles that I could,
  Thin my blankets I shpread
  Wid new shtraw in my bed
And the matther so pleasantly shtood.
Then I towld her my love and intint,
But she said she wad niver consint,
  And from my poor lip, thin,
  The cup she let shlip, thin,
And off wid Mike Rooney she wint.

(CHORUS)

4.
And sure, I'll be niver supplied,
While her shweetness to me is denied,
  Me heart is so lone,
  In my bosom, och, hone!
I's as soon we'd a both of us died.
My sorrows to shmodder I'll try,
Tho' monny a time will I sigh,
  To think of the cup
  Which others may sup
Has no dhrop for my two lips so dry.

(CHORUS)
