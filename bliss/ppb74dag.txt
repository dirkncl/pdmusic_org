[GOLIATH]
Ye men of Israel, 
Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? 
Give me a man, give me a man that we may fight, 
That we may fight 
That we may fight to gether. 
Thus I defy you, thus I defy you. 

[DAVID]
||: Thou comest to me with a sword and a spear, 
but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts. :||

[GOLIATH]
Come to me and I will give thy flesh
to the fowls of the air, 
and to the beasts of the fold.

[DAVID]
The battle is the Lord’s, He  will deliver me, 
The battle is the Lord’s, he will deliver me. 

[DUET] [with overlapping voices]
[DAVID]
The battle is the Lord’s he will deliver me, 
The battle is the Lord’s, he will deliver me. 
I come to thee, I come to thee, I come to thee, I come, 
He will deliver me.
[GOLIATH]
Come to me, come, oh, come to me, 
Come to me, Come, oh, come to me, 
Come to me, oh, come to me. 
Come to me, oh, come to me, 
Oh, come to me, oh, come to me, oh, come to me.
