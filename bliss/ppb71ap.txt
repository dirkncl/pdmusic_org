"Almost Persuaded" (1871)
["Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."--Acts 26: 28.]
from "The Charm: A Collection of Sunday School Music"
Words & Music: Philip Paul Bliss, 1836-1876
  The words were inspired from a sermon by a Reverend Brundage:
He who is almost persuaded is almost saved, but to be almost saved is to be entirely lost.

"Almost persuaded" now to believe;
"Almost persuaded" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call."

"Almost persuaded," come, come today,
"Almost persuaded," turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
O wanderer, come!

"Almost persuaded," harvest is past!
"Almost persuaded," doom comes at last!
"Almost" cannot avail;
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail -
"Almost," but lost!
