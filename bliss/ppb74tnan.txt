by Philip Paul Bliss, 1838-1876

1.
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
  In the shelter of the fold,
But one had wandered far away,
  In the desert so lone and cold;
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
  Away from the Shepherd's tender care.
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
  Away from the Shepherd's tender care.

2.
Shepherd, hast though not here thy ninety and nine;
  Are they not enough for Thee?
But the Shepherd replied, "This one of mine,
  Has wandered away from me;
The way may be wild and rough and steep,
  I go to the desert to find my sheep."
"The way may be wild and rough and steep,
  I go to the desert to find my sheep."

3.
But none of the ransomed ever knew
  How deep were the waters crossed,
Nor how dark was the night the Lord passed through
  Ere he found the sheep that was lost.
Away in the desert He heard its cry,
  So feeble and helpless and ready to die.
Away in the desert He heard its cry,
  So feeble and helpless and ready to die.

4.
Shepherd, whence are those blood-drops all the way
  Up the mountain's rugged track?
"They were shed for the one who has gone astray
  Ere the Shepherd could call him back."
Lord, why are Thy hands so rent and torn?
  --"For him they are pierced by many a thorn."
Lord, why are Thy hands so rent and torn?
  --"For him they are pierced by many a thorn."

5.
And afar up the mountain, thunder-riven,
  And along the rocky steep,
There arose the glad song of joy in heaven,
  "Rejoice, I have found my sheep!"
And the angels echoed around the Throne,
  "Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own."
And the angels echoed around the Throne,
  "Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own."
