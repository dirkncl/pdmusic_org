Tis sweet to be remembered
By those we hold most dear
Tis sweet to hear.

Now Moses you'l catch it,
Not Moses don't touch it,
Now Moses don't you hear what I say.

So too she faded as fades the twilight
Softly she murmured

We'll rally round the flag, Boy's
We'll rally once again,
Shouting the Battle-Cry of Freedom,
Yes, we'll rally from the hillsides,
we'll gather from the plain,
Shouting

Father, dear Father, come home with me now,
The clock in the steeple strikes

A nigger in the fence
And a little common sense
Tells you that you'll never figure any more
Then a Good Bye Jeff! Good Bye Jeff!
I told yo so before

There's a good time coming it's almost here
It was long, long, long, on the way.

Now run and tell Elijah to hurry up Florey
And meet us at the Gum Tree down in the swamp,

To Wake the boys to search for Nellie
Stay not for the dawn.
Who shall sleep when from the Mother's arms

Our Little Johnny Gray back home are you
What do you think you're about.
Littly Johnny Gray back tell me true
Do your patience know your out.

Tis sweet to be remembered

Oh John Brown's body lies mould'ring in the grave,
John Brown's body lies mould'ring in the grave,
John Brown's body lies mould'ring in the grave,
But his soul is ...

Marching through Georgia,
Hurrah! Hurrah! we bring the Jubilee
Hurah! Hurrah! the flag that makes you free
So we sang the chourus from Atlanta to the sea
While we were

Sleighing with girls
A sleighing with girls
Tis nothing else but pleasure

For he blessed me when he left me
And his parting words remain
Treasured deep within this bosom Dearest
We will

Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching
Cheer up comrades they will come
And beneath the starry flag
We shall breath the air again
Of the freeland in our own beloved

Yankee Doodle Doodle Doo.
Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Yankee Doodle, Ha! Ha! Ha!
Yankee Doodle Dandy.
