1. 
I should like to die, said Wilie, if my papa could die too;
But he says he isn’t ready, cause he has so much to do;
And my little sister Nellie, says that I must surely die,
And that she and mama­­ then she stopped, because it made her cry,
And that she and mama­­ then she stopped, because it made her cry.

2. 
But she told me, I remember, once while sitting on her knee,­­
That the angels never weary, watching over her and me;
And that if we’re good, (and mama told me just the same before,)
They will let us into Heaven, when they see us at the door,
They will let us into Heaven, when they see us at the door.

3. 
There, I know I shall be happy, and will always want to stay;
I shall love to hear the singing, I shall love the endless day,
I shall love to look at Jesus, I shall love him more and more,
And I’ll gather water lilies for the angel at the door,
And I’ll gather water lilies for the angel at the door.

4. 
There, will be none but the holy­­ I shall know no more of sin,
But I’ll see mama, and Nellie, for I know he’ll let them in.
But I’ll have to tell the angel, when I meet him at the door,
That he must excuse my papa ’cause he could’nt leave the store,
That he must excuse my papa ’cause he could’nt leave the store.

5. 
Nellie says, that may be I shall very soon be called away
If papa was only ready, I should like to go today,
But, if I should go before him, to that world of light and joy,
Then I guess he’d want to come to Heaven to see his little boy,
Then I guess he’d want to come to Heaven to see his little boy.
