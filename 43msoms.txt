1. I love to watch the moonbeams play, 
By night, upon the trembling lake 
To hear the shepherd’s warbling lay, 
As eve the woodland echo wake. 
But dearer far than pearl or star, 
Or evening’s gentle whisper; 
Like softest music heard afar, 
Is thy sweet voice, my sister! 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
How dull and drear would life appear, 
Wert not for thee, 
Thrice dear to me, 
My sister, Oh! my sister.

2. I’ve loved, when mirth had flushed her heart,
To tease from thence a gentle sighl;
And as the glistening tear would start,
To kiss it off and ask her, “why?”
And then her smile so free from guile,
To me would softly whisper;
That I might compass many a mile,
Nor meet with one like my sister:

3. The crested wave may cease to beat
Upon its old familiar shore:
The summer hide her glowing heat,
And e’er the flowers may bloom no more!
Yet still within this heart of mine
Each throbbing pulse would whisper,
Some note of love for all mankind,—
But most for thee, my sister!
