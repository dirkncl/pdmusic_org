1.
Down on a Boola Boola Isle;
Where the Mermaids chant
Reigns Big Chief Crocodile,
Beneath an Oyster Plant.
He loved a Sea-nymph selfishly
Queen of the Gay White Wave;
Each night, in his shell he'd go to sea,
And in tuneful scales he'd rave:

CHORUS 2 times
Skid-dy-mer-rink-a-dink-a-boomp,
Skid-dy-mer-ink-a-doo, means I love you you,
Skid-dy-mer-rink-a-dink-a-boomp,
Skid-dy-mer-rink-a-doo, means I'll be true.
Skid-dy-mer-rink-a-doo-a-boomp,
Skid-fy-mer-rink-a-doo,
All the time he {sang this rhyme;|sings this rhyme}
"Skid-dy-mer-rink-a-doo-a-boomp,
Skid-fy-mer-rink-a-doo, means I love you."

2.
But when the Midnight Moon was pale;
King Fish Kokomo;
Came floating over with his tale,
To say, he loved her so.
But she was true to Crocodile,
Said "Koko-Nut go 'way;
I know, in a very little while,
You will hear my lover say:

(CHORUS 2 times)
