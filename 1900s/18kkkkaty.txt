"K-K-K-Katy" (1918)
The Sensational Stammering Song Sucess
Sung by the Soldiers and Sailors
By Geoffrey O'Hara
Army Song Leader

1.
Jimmy was a soldier brave and bold,
Katy was a maid with hair of gold,
Like an act of fate,
Kate was standing at the gate,
Watching all the boys on dress parade.
Jimmy with the girls was just a gawk,
Stuttered ev’ry time he tried to talk,
Still that night at eight,
He was there at Katy’s gate,
Stuttering to her this love sick cry.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
“K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy,
You’re the only g-g-g-girl that I adore;
When the m-m-m-moon shines,
Over the cowshed,
I’'ll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.”

2.
No one ever looked so nice and neat,
No one could be just as cute and sweet,
That’s what Jimmy thought,
When the wedding ring he bought,
Now he’s off to France the foe to meet.
Jimmy thought he’d like to take a chance,
See if he could make the Kaiser dance,
Stepping to a tune,
All about the silv’ry moon,
This is what they hear in far off France.
