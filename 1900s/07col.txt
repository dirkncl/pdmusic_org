1. Of deeds, like daises lowly,
A chain of love we’ll make;
Each link a word of kindness,
For lonely hearts that ache.
And with these gentle fetters,
We’ll bind them unto Him,
Whose hand can wipe the teardrops
From eyes with weeping dim.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Of deeds, like snowy daisies,
A chain of love we’ll make;
And clasp the golden fetters
’Round lonely hearts that ache,
And clasp the golden fetters
’Round lonely hearts that ache.

2. We’ll weary not in weaving,
And stong must be the chain;
If we should faint or falter,
Our work would be in vain.
And we must ask for wisdom,
And guidance from above,
That we may show His spirit
In all our works of love.

3. The chain must have no ending,—
But patiently each day,
We’ll try to help the erring
To find the better way.
May each true life of service
In all good works abound,
Until these golden fetters
Shall clasp the world around.
