1. One day a weary traveller walked down a village street
  Did he?
  I think he did!
He thought he’d stop and ask a lady for a bite to eat—
  Did he?
  I think he did!
He knocked upon a door and said in accents so polite:
“I’m very hungry and I hope you’ll let me have a bite!”
”Oh, you shall have my pie!” the young wife answered with delight
  Did she?
  I think she did!

CHORUS 1
Oh, the weary hungry traveller!
The hungry, luckless traveller!
He took one little bit and next minute took to flight,
Oh, the weary, luckless, hungry traveller. The traveller.

2. He walked into a restaurant and ordered quite a spread—
  Did he?
  I think he did!
The waiter brought the bill to him before the man was fed—
  Did he?
  I think he did!
He rapped upon the table and exclaimed: “See here, mine host—
I’m hungry, and of course I’d like a course of quailontoast—
The landlord didn’t quail, but yet he gave his guest a roast
  Did he?
  I think he did!

CHORUS 2
Oh, the shattered, tattered traveller!
The tattered, battered traveller!
Of such an awful roast— no hungry man could boast.
Oh, the shattered, battered, tattered traveller. The traveller.

3. He asked a girl to marry him, she said it couldn’t be.
  Did she?
  I think she did!
She said to work for more than one with her did not agree—
  Did she?
  I think she did!
She said she’d be his sister, but he didn’t like the joke,—
Although he kicked like any steer she wouldn’t take the yoke,—
He swore his heart would break and she suspected he was broke
  Did she?
  I think she did!

CHORUS 3
Oh, the loving, yearning traveller!
The yearning, burning traveller!
His heart was sadly flayed by the cruel little jade.
Oh, the tender, loving, yearning traveller. The traveller.
