1.
O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!

[CHORUS]
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

2.
O beautiful for pilgrim feet,
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!

[CHORUS]
America! America!
God mend thine ev-ery flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self-control,
Thy liberty in law.

3.
O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife,
Who more that self their country loved,
And mercy more than life!

[CHORUS]
America! America!
May God thy gold refine,
Till all success be nobelness,
And ev-ery gain divine.

4.
O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam,
Undimmed by human tears!

[CHORUS]
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
