[Source: photocopy from by Robin Clayton]

1. Jesus saves from sin, maketh pure within, 
Salvation free He doth bestrow; 
All will be received and of guilt relieved, 
So tell it ev’rywhere you go.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, tell (tell it out) it out, (sing it out,) 
And let the weak and wayward know; 
Oh, sing (sweetly sing) and shout, (gladly shout,) 
And tell it ev’rywhere you go. 

2. Jesus keeps the true, leads them safely thru, 
And hides them ever from the foe; 
Cheers them on their way to the land of day, 
So tell it ev’rywhere you go.

3. There are mansions bright in a world of light, 
For all who do His will below; 
And forever there they the crown shall wear, 
So tell it ev’rywhere you go.
