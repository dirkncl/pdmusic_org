1. Tommy Atkins is a warrior bold 
Merrie England loves him more than gold 
And to France the hero of today 
is fighting in the trenches, miles away 
Now Billy Boy, has gane across the sea 
to help them in their fight for Liberty.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Billy Boy, Billy Boy 
you’re a soldier of renown 
Billy Boy, Billy Boy 
in a uniform of brown 
What a grand old sight 
As you battle for the right 
Billy Boy, Billy Boy 
with a heart so fond and true 
for the Red, White and Blue, 
you are loyal thro’ and thro’ 
you put the “Brave” in Bravery 
you are my pride and joy 
Now let the bugle blow, 
come on come on let’s go 
“Atta” boy my Billy Boy. 
Billy Boy.

2. There is Russia with a mighty host, 
Of her sturdy cossacks she can boast 
And for valor no one can forget 
those fearless Belgian lads who’re 
fighting yet Now Billy Boy, its put right up to you 
to help them win so show what you can do.
