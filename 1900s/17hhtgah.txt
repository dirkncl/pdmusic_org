1.
A gang of good fellows are we, (are we,)
are we, (are we,) are we, (are we,)
With never a worry you see, (you see,) 
you see, (you see,) you see, (you see,) 
We laugh and joke, we sing and smoke,
And live life merrily;
No matter the weather
when we get together
we have a jubilee.

CHORUS 2 times
Hail! Hail! the gang's all here,
What the _duece_ do we care,
What the _duece_ do we care,
Hail! Hail! we're full of cheer,
What the _duece_ do we care Bill!

2.
We love one another we do, (we do,) 
we do, (we do,) we do, (we do,) 
With brotherly love and it's true, (it's true,) 
it's true, (it's true,) it's true, (it's true,) 
It's one for all, the big and small,
It's always me for you;
No matter the weather
when we get together
we drink a toast for two.

(CHORUS two times)

3.
When out for a good time we go, (we go,) 
we go, (we go,) we go, (we go,) 
There nothing we do that is slow, (is slow,) 
is slow, (is slow,) is slow, (is slow,) 
Of joy we get our share you bet,
The gang will tell you so;
No matter the weather
when we get together
we sing this song you know:

(CHORUS two times)
