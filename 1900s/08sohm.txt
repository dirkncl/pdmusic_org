"Shine On, Harvest Moon" (Copyrighted Nov. 7, 1908)
Sung by Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth in "The Follies of 1908"
Words by Jack Norworth, 1879-1959
Music by [Mrs.] Nora Bayes [Norworth], 1880-1928

1.
The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see,
For the moon refused to shine,
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree,
For love they pine,
Little maid was kind afraid of darkness
So she said, "I guess I'll go,"
Boy began to sigh,
Looked up at the sky,
Told the moon his little tale of woe.

CHORUS
Oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky.
I ain't had no lovin'
Since April, January June or July,
Snow time ain't no time to stay out doors and spoon,
So, shine on, shine on, harvest moon,
For me and my gal.

2.
I can't see why a boy should sigh, when by his side
is the girl he love so true,
All he has to say is "Won't you be my bride,
For I love you,
Why should I be telling you this secret
When I know that you can guess,"
Harvest moon will smile,
Shine on all the while,
If the little girl should answer "Yes."

(CHORUS)
