1. All was hushed o’er the slumbering city, 
Night’s mantle had scarcely been drawn; 
But who knew of the sorrow and pity, 
That waited the coming of dawn? 
For the earth with its might was so riven, 
Then fierce flames ev’rywhere soon were found; 
And all from their dear homes were driven, 
San Francisco was burning to the ground! 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
San Francisco, Dear old ’Frisco, 
Watching o’er the Golden Gate, 
How our hearts go out to greet you, 
Stricken by the hand of Fate! 
Homes have vanished, Dear ones perished, 
There beside that Western Shore; 
Yet you smile through tears so bravely, 
And we’ll love you evermore.

2. For your gay crowds again we are longing, 
That mixed ’neath the bright sparkling lights; 
As they strolled down old Market street, throng ing, 
Cafès on those Grand Opera nights! 
From the Cliff House, clear down to the Ferry, 
And O’ Farell street, Chinatown too; 
They’ve gone with old ’Frisco so merry, 
But here’s luck to great ’Frisco rising new!
