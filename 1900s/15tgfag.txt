Thank God for a garden,
Be it ever so small,
Thank God for the sunshine,
That comes flooding it all!
Thank God for the flowers,
For the rain and the dew,
Thank God for summer, that brings me you!
Thank God for the sunrise,
For the new morning bright,
Thank God for the sunset,
That is “Shepherd’s delight;”
Thank God for the cornfields,
In the moonlight of blue,
Thank God for summer,
Thank God for you!
