1. I’ve got an old mule and her name is Sal,
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal.
She’s a good old worker and a good ald pal,
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal,
We’ve hauled some barges in our day,
Filled with lumber, coal and hay,
And ev’ry inch of the way I know,
From Albany to Buffalo.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Low bridge, ev’rybody down,
Low bridge, we must be getting near a town,
You can always tell your neighbor,
You can always tell your pal,
If he’s ever navigated on the Erie Canal.
Low bridge, ev’rybody down,
Low bridge I’ve got the finest mule in town,
Once a man named Mike McGinty tried to put it over Sal,
Now he’s ’way down at the bottom of the Erie Canal.

2. We’d better look ’round for a job old gal,
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal.
You bet your life I wouldn’t part with Sal,
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal,
Giddap there gal we’ve passed that lock,
We’ll make Rome ’fore six o’clock,
So one more trip and then we’ll go,
Right straight back to Buffalo.
