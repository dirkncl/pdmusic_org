1. Nights are growing very lonely,
Days are very long;
I’m agrowing weary only
List’ning for your song.
Old remembrances are thronging
Thro’ my memory.
Till it seems the world is full of dreams
Just to call you back to me.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
There’s a long, long trail awinding
In to the land of my dreams,
Where the nightingales are singing
And a white moon beams:
There’s a long, long night of waiting
Until my dreams all come true;
Till the day when I’ll be going down
That long, long trail  with you.

2. All night long I hear you calling,
Calling sweet and long;
Seem to hear your footsteps falling,
Ev’ry where I go.
Tho’ the road between us stretches
Many a weary mile.
I forget that you’re not with me yet,
When I think I see you smile.
