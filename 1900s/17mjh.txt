1. I know a certain young fellow, 
Who’s filling people with joy; 
How would you like to day “hello,” 
To this remarkable boy? 
Ev’ryone’s talking about him. 
He’s been the topic for days; 
He’s just a winsome gent, with an instrument, that plays; 
I’d like to have you meet him.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Shake hands with Mister Jazz, himself! 
He took the saxophone from off the shelf 
And when you hear him play; 
You’ll say  that he’s been taking lessons up in Heaven. 
That dreamy moan, is his own ’riginality; 
He knows a strange sort of change in a minor key, 
I don’t know how he does it; 
But when he starts to play the blues, 
He’s like a messenger of happy news; 
No one else could ever do it as, 
My friend, Mister Jazz. 

2. I never cared about discords, 
They never cared about me; 
But when I listen to his cords, 
We both agree to agree 
He’s not a Wagner or Verdi. 
He’s not a classy highbrow; 
He’s just the bow who has, put the joy in jazz, and now; 
I’d like to have you meet him.
