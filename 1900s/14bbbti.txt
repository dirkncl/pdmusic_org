1. Oh! don’t you hear that whistle blowing!
Oh, oh, oh,
Goodbye! the North bound train will soon be going!
Oh, oh, oh,
I’ve been lonesome down in Dixie,
Just as lonesome as a boy could be;
And if your girl lived along the Wabash
You’d be singing just like me!

2. I’ll be so happy in the morning
Oh, oh, oh,
Because I’ll see the town that I was born in!
Oh, oh, oh,
There a lonely girl is waiting,
But I’ll make her mighty happy soon;
And again we’ll roam along the Wabah
’Neath the Indiana moon.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Back, back, back to Indiana!
Where the Wabash flows,
To my Hoosier Rose.
Back, back, through the fields of clover,
We’ll drive down to town and bring the parson over.
So long old Savannah,
You’re a good old town, I know!
But the best thing here, is the first train, dear.
Back, back, back to Indiana!
