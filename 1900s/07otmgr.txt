1. Sweet Mamie Bailey used to go daily 
Down to a merrygo round, 
With Sister Molly so cute and so jolly 
Each ev’ning night there they’d be found; 
Mamie’s young steady, whose first name was Teddy, 
Would also be there ev’ry night, 
As ’round they’d go swinging they’d all be a  singing 
With hearts that were filled with delight.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
On the merry, merry goround, 
On the merry, merry goround 
Ain’t it dandy, ain’t it fine, 
Breezing round in the good Summertime 
To the tune of Sweet Rose O’ Grady 
And Keep on the Sunny Side, 
If you get the Brass Ring boys! 
One, Two, Three, 
You can ride, ride, ride.

2. There was Tom Brady with his steady lady, 
Hughie and Sadie McCoe, 
Young Peter Darcy with sweet Kitty Carcy 
And also Kit’s young brother Lou, 
Lizzie McGuire with hair red as fire 
Would join in the merry old throng, 
As the organ was playing around they’d go sailing 
With ev’ryone singing this song.
