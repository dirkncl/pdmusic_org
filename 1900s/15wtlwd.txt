1.
The nation is sad as can be,
A message came over the sea,
A thousand more, who sailed from our shore,
Have gone to eternity.
The Statue of Liberty high
Must now have a tear in her eye,
I think, it's a shame,
Some one is to blame,
But all we can do is just sigh!

CHORUS 2 times
Some of us lost a true sweet-heart,
Some of us lost a dear dad,
Some lost their mothers, sisters and brothers,
Some lost the best friends they had.
It's time they were stopping this warfare,
If women and children must drown,
Many brave hearts went to sleep in the deep,
When the Lousitania went down.

2.
A lesson to all it should be,
When we feel like crossing the sea,
American ships, that sail from our slips,
Are safer for you and me.
A Yankee can go anywhere,
As long as Old Glory is there,
Altho' there were warned,
The warning they scorned,
And now must cry in despair:

(CHORUS 2 times)
