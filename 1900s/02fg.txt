1. There's a chap that's just now famous, Foxy Grandpa is his name.
You will find him at your elbow ev'ry day.
At home or at the theatre, club at ev'ry sort of game.
You're sure to meet old Foxy Grandpa gay.
When at a masquerade dance, if there's one that makes you ask,
Who is that jolly old boy, all dress'd in blue?
Don't waste your time on guessing who is underneath the mask,
For when the mask's removed you'll find it's Grandpa fooling you.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
It's only Foxy, Grandpa,
There is no use getting vexed,
The old boy keeps you guessing
What he will be up to next.
So join his merry laughter
With a hearty Ha, Ha, Ha!
Because it's only Foxy,
Just your jolly old Grandpa.

2. When a pretty girl who's waiting in the twilight at the gate,
Hears a gentle footstep in the path below,
She's sure her lover's coming, but why does he come so late?
Good gracious! but her heart is beating so.
Two hands are placed upon her eyes, upon her lips a kiss,
A laugh rings out upon the summer air,
"Oh, Grandpa! aren't you horrid?" Says the pouting little miss,
"I never dreamed that it was you, it really isn't fair!"
