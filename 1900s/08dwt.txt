1.
There's a sweet old story
You have heard before.
Here among the daisies
Let my tell it o'er;
Only say you love me,
For I love you well.
Answer with a kiss, dear,
Daisies never tell.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Daisies won't tell, dear,
Come kiss me do.
Tell me you love me.
Say you'll be true.
And I will promise
Always to be
Tender and faithful,
Sweetheart, to thee.

2.
In a dream I fancied
You were by my side.
While I gathered daisies
One long chain you tied,
'Round us both I would it,
Close I held you, too.
Daisies never tell, dear,
Make that dream come true.
