"The Year's at the Spring" (1900)
Words by Robert Browning, 1812-1889
Music by Amy Marcy Cheney Beach, 1867-1944
(from "Three Browning Songs", Opus 44, No. 1)

The year's at the spring,
And day's at the morn,
Morning's at seven;
The hillside's dew-pearled;
The year's at the spring;
And day's at the morn;
The lark's on the wing;
The snail's on the thorn;
God's in his heaven,
God's in his heaven,
All's right,
All's right with the world!
