1. I’ve lost a dog, my daddy bought me;
He was a bad dog, ¦cause he fought me;
Tore my dress and ran away.
When with him I tried to play.
So, my ma said, just for that,
I should adopt a Pussy cat.
And I’ve git ine now, you know,
I can take around and show.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Have you seen my Pussy cat, Pussy cat, Pussy cat?
Have you seen my Pussy cat?
With her cute little me’owow ow.

2. My little puss is cure and frisky;
Likes to explore the things thats risky,
That’s why she met one mishap,
When I hid her in my lap.
Up came a Tom cat, big and black;
Humped up his spine, gave her a whack;
But Puss snapped and he turned pale,
When he found he’d lost his tail.

3. Down at the seashore I was standing;
Watching the bathers from the landing,
With my hand I held puss tight;
’Fraid the boys might give her fright.
All of a sudden my feet slipped;
I heard a noise like something ripped!
When they hauld us back on land,
My poor puss was full of sand.
