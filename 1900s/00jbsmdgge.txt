1. A black man in a minstrel show,
was sitting on the end,
A nice black gal in the very front row
with heaps of dough to spend,
look’d up at him, with a silly smile
He started singing his end song,
forgot most ev’ry line,
The manager hurried back and said,
“You’ve got to stand a fine”—
he lost his job, for quite a while.

CHORUS 1 [sung twice]
Just because she made them googoo eyes
I thought I’d won a home and copp’d a prize.
She is the best what is and I need her in my biz,
Just because she makes them googoo eyes.

2. This minstrel man wash’d up right quick
and meets her at the door,
Tips his hat says how do you do,
I’m with this troupe no more,
it was for you, I paid no fine
I wants to ask one question now,
please let me call you dear,
It costs a lot to gain a rep,
But I’ll blow the road right here,
if you’ll be mine, if you’ll be mine.

CHORUS 2 [sung twice]
Just because she makes them googoo eyes
I know I’ve won a home and copp’d a prize.
You is the best what is and I wants you in my biz
Just becaus you make them googoo eyes. 

3. Next morning when the troupe had left,
this baby throw’d him down,
She said to him, “I’ll have you ‘pinched’
if you stay in this town,
oh, listen to this tslr of woe
He said I’ll send a teles patch to try and join the show,
What can I do in this strange land,
Can’t eat without no dough,
so here I am, out in the snow.

CHORUS 3 [sung twice]
Just because she make them googoo eyes
I though I had a home and copp’d a prize.
She was the best what is but drove me right back in the biz
Just because she made them googoo eyes.
