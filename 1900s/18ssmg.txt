1. Gee, but I’m lonesome, lonesome and blue
I’ve found out something I never knew
I know now what it means to be sad
For I’ve lost the best gal I ever had;
She only left yesterday
Somebody stole her away.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Somebody stole my gal
Somebody stole my pal
Somebody came out took her away
She didn’t even say she was leavin’,
The kisses I loved so
He’s getting now I know
And Gee! I know that she
would come to me
if she could see
Her broken hearted lonesome pal,
Somebody stole my gal.

2. Angels they say are only above
I know that’s wrong because my old love
Sure is an angel take it from me
And she’s all the angel I want to see;
May be she’ll come back some day
All I can do now is pray.
