1. Years of time are swiftly passing,
Bringing nearer heaven’s goal;
Soon I’ll be at home with Jesus,
While eternal ages roll.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O how precious is the promise,
That with gladness fills my soul!
I shall be at home with Jesus,
While eternal ages roll!

2. After all the days of waiting,
For His voice to bid me come,
I shall walk beside my Saviour,
’Mid bright scenes where angels roam.

3. After leaving earthly pathways,
Which my weary feet have pressed,
I shall stray by life’s fair river,
Finding holy peace and rest.

4. Aftter last farewells are spoken,
I shall meet dear ones I’ve known,
In the presence of our Saviour,
When we stand before His throne.
