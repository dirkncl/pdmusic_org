"My Gal Sal; or, They Called Her Frivolous Sal." (6 March 1905)
by Paul Dresser [real name: Paul Dreiser]
(b. Terre Haute, IN, 1858; d. New York, NY, 1906)

1.
Ev'rything is over and I'm feeling bad,
I lost the best pal that I ever had;
'Tis but a fort-night, since she was here,
Seems like she's gone though for twenty year
Oh, how I miss her my old pal,
Oh how I'd kiss her my gal Sal;
Face not so handsome, but eyes don't you know
That shone just as bright, as they did years ago.

CHORUS
They called her frivolous Sal,
A peculiar sort of a gal,
With a heart that was mellow,
An all 'round good fellow,
Was my old pal;
Your troubles[,] sorrorws and care,
She was always willing to share,
A wild sort of devil,
But dead on the level,
Was my gal Sal.

2.
Brought her little dain[-]ties just afore she died,
Promised she would meet me, on the other side;
Told her how I loved her, she said: "I know Jim,"
Just do your best, leave the rest to Him;
Gently I pressed her to my breast,
Soon she would take her last long rest,
She looked at me and murmured "Pal,"
And softly I whispered, "Goodbye Sal."

(CHORUS)
