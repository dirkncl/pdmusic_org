1. Sometimes when I feel bad and things look blue,
I wish a girl I had— say one like you
Someone within my heart to build her throne,
Someone who’d never part, to call my own.
I’ll try a love to teach, dear, fond and true.
I sigh a word to reach, dear, just made for me and you.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
If I were the only girl in the world,
And you were the only boy,
Nothing else would matter in the world today,
We could go on loving in the same old way.
A Garden of Eden, just made for two,
With nothing to mar your you;
I would say such wonderful things to you,
There would be such wonderful things to do,
If I were the only girl in the world,
And you were the only boy.

2. No one I’ll ever care for, dear, but you,
No one I’ll fancy, therefore— love me do,
Your eyes have set me dreaming all night long,
Your eyes have set me scheming right or wrong.
All days we’ll be together side by side,
Always in any weather, whatever else betide.
