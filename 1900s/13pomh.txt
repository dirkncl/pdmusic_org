1.
Oh! my heart's in a whirl,
Over one little girl,
I love her, I love her, yes, I do, 
Altho' her heart is far away,
I hope to make her mine some day,
Ev'ry beautiful rose, ev'ry violet knows,
I love her, I love her fond and true,
And her heart fondly sighs, as I sing to her eyes,
Her eyes of blue,
Sweet eyes of blue, my darling!

Peg O' My Heart,
I love you,
We'll never part,
I love you, dear little girl,
Sweet little girl,
Sweeter than the rose of Erin,
are your winning smiles endearin',
Peg O' My Heart,
Your glances with Irish art entrance me,
Come, be my own,
Come, make your home in my heart.

2.
When your heart's full of fears,
And your eyes full of tears,
I'll kiss them, I'll kiss them all away;
For, like the gold that's in your hair,
Is all the love for you I bear,
O, believe in me, do,
I'm as lonesome as you,
I miss you, I miss you all the day,
Let the light of live shine from your eyes into mine,
And shine for aye,
Sweetheart for aye, my darling!
