1.
There's a day 
we feel gay 
  if the weather's fine;
Ev'ry lad 
feels so glad 
  if the sun does shine.
In his best
he is dressed 
  and with smiling face.
He goes with his Pearlie, 
his own little girlie, 
  to some nice place.

CHORUS [sung two times after each verse]
On a Sunday afternoon 
In the merry month of June
  Take a trip on the Hudson or down the bay,
  Take a trolley to Coney or Rockaway,
On a Sunday afternoon, 
You can see the lovers spoon.
  They work hard on Monday,
  But one day that's fun day 
Is Sunday afternoon.

2.
Coming home 
starry dome 
  with a soft moonshine.
Lovers kiss 
oh, what bliss! 
  oh, what joy divine!
"Goodnight, Joe." 
"Goodnight, Flo 
  don't forget now, dear,
Next Sunday at two 
I'll be waiting for you 
  on the old iron Pier."
