Anchors Aweigh, my boys,
Anchors Aweigh,
Farewell to college joy, we sail at break of
day-day-day-day!
Through our last night on shore,
Drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more
Here’s wishing you a happy voyage home.
Heave aho there sailor, ev’ry body drink up while you may,
Heave aho there sailor, for you’re gonna sail at break of day,
Drink away, Drink away,
For you sail at break of day, Hey!
Stand Navy down the field
Sail to the sky
We’ll never change our course so Army you steer shy-y-y-y
Roll up the score Navy
Anchors Aweigh
Sail Navy down the field
And sink the Army, sink the Army Grey.
