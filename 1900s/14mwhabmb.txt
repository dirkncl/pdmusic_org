"Missouri Waltz" (1914)
(Hush-a-Bye, Ma Baby)
Lyrics by J. R. Shannon
Melody by John Valentine Eppel
Arranged for piano by Frederick Knight Logan

Hush-a-bye, ma baby, slumbertime is comin' soon;
Rest yo' head upon my breast while Mammy hums a tune;
The sandman is callin' where shadows are fallin',
While the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by.
'Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody,
When I was a Pickaninny on ma Mammy's knee;
The darkies were hummin',
Their banjos were strummin'
So sweet and low.

Strum, strum, strum, strum, strum.
Seems I hear those banjos playin' once again,
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum,
That same old plantive strain.

Hear that mournful melody,
It just haunts you the whole day long,
And you wander in dreams back to Dixie, it seems,
When you hear that oldtime song.

Hush-a-bye, ma baby, go to sleep on Mammy's knee.
Journey back to Dixie land in dreams again with me;
It seems like yo' Mammy was there once again,
And the darkies were strumin' that same old refrain
'Way down in Missouri where I learned this lullaby,
When the stars were blinkin' and the moon was climbin' high,
And I hear Mammy Cloe, as in days long ago
Singin' hush-a-bye.
