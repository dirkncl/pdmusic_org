1.
Most ev’ry fellow has a sweetheart
Some little girl with eyes of blue
My daddy also had a sweetheart
And he fought to win her too
There'll come a day when we must pay the price of love and duty
Be there staunch and true

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
It’s time for ev’ry boy to be a soldier
To put his strength and courage to the test
It's time to place a musket on his shoulder
And wrap the Stars and Stripes around his breast
It’s time to shout those noble words of Lincoln
And stand up for the land that gave you birth
“That the nation of the people by the people for the people
Shall not perish from the earth”

2.
Boys of America get ready
Your motherland is calling you
Boys of America be steady
For the Old Red White and Blue
When Yankee Doodle comes to town up on his little pony
Be there staunch and true
