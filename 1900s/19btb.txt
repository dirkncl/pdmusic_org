1. Down in Savanna lives a darkey known as Hosanna Clay, 
How that darkey can play 
He has those piano keys a moanin’ 
Blue Harmonies all day, 
He drives your sorrows away, 
Mister Clay, can play the Blues to any old tune you happen to say.

2. And when Hosanna plays a dance for you, 
You cannot refuse, 
You just wear our your shoes, 
He plays piano so sweet, 
You dance till your weary feet refuse, 
To lift up both of your shoes, 
They refuse, 
Until he starts to play his tune he calls Bluin’ the Blues.

Bluin’ the Blues, 
Bluin’ the Blues. 
The people all declare, Hosanna is a bear, 
At the piano no one can compare. 
They just wear out their shoes, 
When he is doin’ the lovin’ Bluin’ Blues, Bluin’ the Blues. 

Now 
||: Clay can surely play, 
How Clay can make you sway, 
The people all declare, Hosanna is a bear 
At the piano no one can compare. 
They just 
[1st end.]
wear out their shoes, 
When his is doin’ the lovin’ Bluin’ Blues, Bluin’ the Blues. 
[2nd end.]
wear out their shoes, 
When he is doin’ Bluin’ Blues, Some Blues.
