1. Honey I have something to tell you
And it’s worth while listening to
Put your little head on my shoulder
So that I can whisper to you.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Whispering while you cuddle near me,
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it’s true
There’s no one dear, but you,
you’re whispering why you’ll never leave me
Whispering why you’ll never greive me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whisper that I love but you.

2. When the twilight shadows are falling
And the weary world is at rest
Then I’ll whisper just why I know dear
Loving time is always the best.
