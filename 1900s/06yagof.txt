1.
There's a feeling comes a-stealing and it sets my brain a-reeling,
When I'm list'ning to the music of a military band.
Any tune like "Yankee Doodle" simply sets me off my noodle,
It's that patriotic something no one can understand.
[Chorus]
"Way, down South in the land of cotten,"
[Solo]
melody untiring,
Ain't that inspriring!
[Chorus]
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll sing the jubilee,
[Solo]
And that's going some for the Yankees, by gum!
Red, White and Blue,
I am for you,
Honest, you're a grand old flag.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
You're a grand old flag tho' your torn to a rag,
And forever in peace you may wave.
You're the emblem of the land I love,
The home of the free and the brave,
Ev'ry heart beats true under Red, White and Blue.
Where there's never a boast or a brag;
"But should auld acquaintance be forgot,"
Keep your eye on the grand old flag.

2.
I'm so cranky, hanky panky, I'm a dead square honest Yankee,
And I'm mighty proud of that old flag that flies for Uncle Sam.
Though I don't believe in raving ev'ry time I see it waving,
There's a chill runs up my back that makes me glad I'm what I am.
[Chorus]
Here's a land with a million soldiers,
[Solo]
that's if we should need 'em,
We'll fight for freedom!
[Chorus]
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For ev'ry Yankee Tar
[Solo]
And old G. A. R., ev'ry stripe, ev'ry star,
Red, White and Blue,
Hats off to you,
Honest, you're a grand old flag.
