"Alexander's Ragtime Band" (1911)
Words and Music
by Irving Berlin [Israel Baline], 1888-1989)

1.
Oh, ma honey,
Oh, ma honey,
Better hurry and let's meander,
Ain't you goin',
Ain't you goin',
To the leader man, ragged meter man?
On, ma honey,
Oh, ma honey,
Let me take you to Alexander's grand stand, brass band,
Ain't you comin' along?

CHORUS 2 times
Come on and hear,
Come on and hear,
Alexander's ragtime band,
Come on and hear,
Come on and hear,
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,
So natural that you want to go to war;
That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb,
Come on along,
Come on along,
Let me take you by the hand,
Up to the man,
Up to the man who's the leader of the band,
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime,
Come on and hear,
Come on and hear,
Alexander's ragtime band.

2.
Oh, ma honey,
Oh, ma honey,
There's a fiddle with notes that screetches,
Like a chicken,
Like a chicken,
And the clarinet is a colored pet,
Come and listen,
Come and listen,
To a classical band what's peaches, come now, somehow,
Better hurry along.

(CHORUS 2 times)
