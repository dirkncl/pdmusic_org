I’ve been away from you a long time
I never thought I’d miss you so
Somehow I feel
Your love was real
Near you I long to be
The birds are singing
It is songtime
The banjos strummin’ soft and low
I know that you
Yearn from me too Swanee
You’re calling me.

REFRAIN
My dear old Swan-ee
I’d give the world to be
Among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven know my
Mammy’s
Waiting for me
Praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I go to the Swanee shore

TRIO [sung two times]
Swan-ee
Swan-ee
I am coming back to Swanee
Mammy Mammy
I love the old folks at home.
