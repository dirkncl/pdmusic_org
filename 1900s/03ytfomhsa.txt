1.
In the evening when I sit alone a dreaming
Of days gone by, love to me so dear,
There's a picture that in fancy 'oft appearing,
Brings back the time love when you were near.
It is then I wonder where you are my darling,
And if your heart to me is still the same,
For the sighing wind and nightengale a-singing
Are breathing only your own sweet name.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sweet Adeline,
My Adeline
At night,
Dear heart
For you I pine,
In all my dreams,
Your fair face beams,
You're the flower of my heart,
Sweet Adeline.

2.
I can see your smiling face as when we wandered
Down by the brookside just you and I,
And it seems so real at times 'till I awak'en
To find all vanished a dream gone by;
If we meet sometime in after years my darling,
I trust that I will find your love still mine.
Tho' my heart is sade and clouds above are hov'ring
The sun again love for me would shine.
