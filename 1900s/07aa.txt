"Anchor's Aweigh" (1907)
Words for verses 1 and 2 by A. H. Miles;
for verse 3, by R. Lovell, 1926
Music by Charles Z. Zimmerman

1.
Stand Navy down the field,
  Sails set to the sky,
We'll never change our course,
  So Army you steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll up the score, Navy,
  Anchor's Aweigh,
Sail Navy down the field
  And sink the Army, sink the Army Grey.

2.
Get under way, Navy,
  Decks cleared for the fray,
We'll hoist true Navy Blue
  So Army down your Grey-y-y-y.
Full speed ahead, Navy;
  Army heave to,
Furl Black and Grey and Gold
  And hoist the Navy, hoist the Navy Blue.

3.
Blue of the Seven Seas,
  Gold of God's great sun --
Let these our colors be
  Till all of time be done-n-n-ne.
By Severn shores we learn
  Navy's stern call:
Faith, courage, service true
  With honor over, honor over all.
