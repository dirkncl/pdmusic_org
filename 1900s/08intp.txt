1. I need the pray’rs of those I love,
While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,
That I may true and faithful be,
And live for Jesus ev’ry day.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I want my friends to pray for me,
To bear my tempted soul above,
And intercede with God for me;
I need the pray’rs of those I love.

2. I need the pray’rs of those I love,
To help me in each trying hour,
To bear my tempted soul to Him,
That He may keep me by His pow’r.

3. I want my friends to pray for me,
To hold me up on wings of faith,
That I may walk the narrow way,
Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.
