1.
Joe and Jane were always together.
Said Joe to Jane "I have Summer weather.
So let's go to that beautiful sea,
Follow along,
Say "you're with me!"
Any thing that Joe would suggest to her,
Jane would always think it was best for her.
So he'd get his Ford.
Holler "All aboard--
Gee I want to be."

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
By the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea,
You and I, you and I, oh! how happy we'll be,
When each wave comes a-rolling in.
We will duck or swim,
And we'll float and fool around the water.
Over and under, and then up for air.
Pa is rich, Ma is rich, so now what do we care?
I love to be beside your side,
Beside the sea, beside the seaside,
By the beautiful sea.

2.
Joe was quite a sport on a Sunday.
Though he would eat at Childs on a Monday.
And Jane would lose her millionaire air.
And go to work,
Macelling hair,
Ev'ry Sunday he'd leave his wife at home,
Say "It's bus'ness, honey, I've got to roam,"
Then he'd miss his train,
Get his Ford and Jane,
And say "Come with ne."
