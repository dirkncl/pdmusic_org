1. Now poets may sing of the dear Father land
And the soft flowing dreamy old Rhine
Beside the Blue Danube in fancy they stand
And they rave of its beauties divine
But there is a spot where the sun never shines
Where mirth and good fellowship reign
For dear old Bohemia my lonely heart pines
And I long to be there once again

REFRAIN [sung twice after each VERSE]
Take me down, down, down where the
Wurzburger flows, flows, flows
It will drown, drown, drown
all your troubles and cares and woes;
Just order tow seidels of lager, or three
If I don’t want to drink it, please force it on me,
The Rhine may be fine but a cold stein for mine,
Down where the Wurzburger flows

2. The Rhine by moonlight’s a beautiful sight,
When the wind whispers low thro’ the vines
But give me some good old Rathskellar at night
Where the brilliant electric light shines
The poet’s may think it’s delightful to hear
The nightengale piping his lay
Give me a piano, a cold stein of beer
And a fellow who knows how to play
