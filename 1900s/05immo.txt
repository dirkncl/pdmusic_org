1.
Young Johnnie Steele has an Oldsmobile,
He loves a dear little girl,
She is the queen of his gas machine,
She has his heart in a whirl.
Now, when they go for a spin, you know,
She tries to learn the auto, so
He lets her steer while he get her ear,
And whispers soft and low;

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Come away with me Lucile
In my merry Oldsmobile,
Down the road of life we’ll fly
Automobubbling you and I.
To the church we’ll swiftly steal,
Then our wedding bells will peal,
You can go as far as you like with me,
In my merry Oldsmobile.

2.
They love to spark in the dark old park,
As they go flying along,
She says she knows why the motor goes;
The sparker’s awfully strong.
Each day they spoon to the engine’s tune,
Their honeymoon will happen soon,
He’ll win Lucile with his Oldsmobile
And then he’ll fondly croon;
