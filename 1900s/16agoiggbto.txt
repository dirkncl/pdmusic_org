1. Pat McCarty, hale and hearty, living in Oregon,
Heard a lot of talk about the great New York;
He left the farm, where all was calm and landed on old Broadway,
He coaxed a little Mary Ann into a swell café.
The waiter brought the card and said, “what will you have,” to Pat;
Then Pat looked at the prices and he said “I’ll have me hat.”

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Arrah go on, I’m gonna go back to Oregon,
Arrah go on, I’m gonna go back and stay.
I could buy the horses many a bale of hay,
 for all that I’d have to pay to feed a chicken on old Broadway,
Arrah go on, there’s somebody back in Oregon,
Who calls me Uncle Pat, not Uncle John;
Arrah go on, go way, go wid yer go way, go wid yer go way, go on,
Array go on, I’m gonna go back to Oregon.

2. Pat McCarty broke the party up into smithereens,
Said “your bill of fare, would give a bull a scare;
I want to eat but I repeat, I don’t want to buy the place,”
And Mary Ann was sitting there with blushes on her face.
She said, “I’ll have a little steak, that’s all I want right now;”
And Pat said, “what it costs for steaks, why I could buy a cow.”
