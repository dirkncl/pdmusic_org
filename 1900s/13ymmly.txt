1. I’ve been worried all day long,
Don’t know if I’m right or wrong,
I can’t help just what I say
Your love makes me speak this way,
Why, oh! why should I feel blue,
Once I used to laugh at you,
But now I’m crying,
No one denying,
There’s no one else but you will do,

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
You made me love you,
I didn’t want to do it
I didn’t want to do it,
You made me want you,
And all the time you knew it,
I guess you always knew it,
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times dear,
You made me feel so bad.
You made me sigh for
I didn’t want to tell you
I didn’t want to tell you
I want some love that’s true,
Yes I do,
’Deed I do,
You know I do.
Give me give me what I cry for,
You know you get the brand of kisses that I’d die for
You know you made me love you.

2. I had pictured in my mind,
Some day I would surely find,
Someone handsome, someone true,
Bit I never thought of you,
Now my dream of love is o’er,
I want you and nothing more,
Come on, enfold me,
Come on, and hold me
Just like you never did before,
