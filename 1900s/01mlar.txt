To Mrs. Adele Laeis Baldwin.
"Mighty Lak' a Rose" (Sep. 6, 1901)
Text by Frank L. Stanton, 1857-1927
Music by Ethelbert Nevin, 1862-1901 

Sweetest li'l' feller,
Ev'rybody knows;
Dunno what to call him,
But he mighty lak' a rose!
Lookin' at his Mammy
Wid eyes so shiny blue,
Mek' you think that heav'n
Is comin' clost to you!

W'en he's dar asleepin',
In his li'l' place,
Think I see de angels
Lookin' thro' de lace,
W'en de dark is fallin',
W'en de shadders creep,
Den dey comes on tiptoe
Ter kiss 'im in his sleep.

Sweetest li'l' feller,
Ev'rybody knows;
Dunno what to call him,
But he mighty lak' a rose!
Lookin' at his Mammy
Wid eyes so shiny blue,
Mek' you think that heav'n
Is comin' clost to you!
