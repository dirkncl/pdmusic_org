1.
Place park, scene dark,
Silv'ry moon is shining thro' the trees;
Cast two, me, you,
Sound of kisses floating on the breeze.
Act one, begun,
Dialoque, "Where would you like to spoon?"
My cue, with you,
Underneath the silv'ry moon.

CHORUS [sung two times after each verse]
By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon,
To my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a-shining in June,
Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams,
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

2.
Act two, scene new,
Roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me,
Preacher with a solemn looking face.
Choir sings, bell rings
Preacher: "You are wed forevermore."
Act two, all through,
Ev'ry night the same encore.
