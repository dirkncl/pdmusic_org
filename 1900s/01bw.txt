1.
When the leaves are falling,
And the quail are calling,
Bob White! Bob White!
Steady, Don­­ no flushing!
Hold, there! Don­­ you’re rushing!
Bob White! Bob White!
Bang! Bang! Shots are ringing
At the covey springing.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Bob White! Bob White!
When the leaves are falling,
And the quail are calling,
Bob White!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come ere the sunshine has kissed off the dew
Of the scent laying morn, with its bright Autumn hue.
Bob White, my first love, to thee I’d be true.
Ah! little quail, I love you.
Bob White!

2.
If the quail are running,
When you’re out a gunning,
Bob White! Bob White!
Eagerly you follow,
Over hill and hollow,
Bob White! Bob White!
Don is backing Dash there!
Steady, don’t be rash there!
