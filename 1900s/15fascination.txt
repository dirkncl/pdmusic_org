[She]
I know such little art,
I know the manly heart,
Just what to do and to say,
How to put winning guile
Into my ev’ry smile,
Tricks that will make men obey.
I’ve made a study of
That game that’s known as Love,
I know the wherefore and why,
I capture nine of ten,
For I know with the men
Where all fascinations lie.
[REFRAIN]
[She]
Fascination! Fascination!
In a woman’s eyes,
Fascination! Fascination!
On, the light that lies!
You will do the things she wants you to,
Any time she smiles at you;
She’s the master of all you do,
Fascinating you!
[DUET with overlapping voices]
[She]
Oh you dear! Oh you dear!
Woman’s eyes!
Come to me! Come to me!
Oh the light that lies!
You will do the things she wants you to,
Any time she smiles at you,
She’s the master of all you do,
Fascinating you!
[He]
Fascination! Fascination!
In a woman’s eyes!
Fascination! Fascination!
Oh the light that lies!
Do the things she wants you to,
Any time she smiles at you, all you do,
Fascinating you!
