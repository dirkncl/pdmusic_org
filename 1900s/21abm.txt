1. 1’m so unhappy What’ll I do,
I long for somebody who,
will sympathize with me;
I’m growing so tired of living alone,
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me that’s why.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night;
I sit alone in a cosy Morris chair,
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire
All by myself I get loneky
Watching the clock on the shelf
I’d love to rest my weary head on somebody’s shoulder
I hate to grow older
All by myself. self.

2. My name and number are in the book,
The one that hangs on a hook,
In almost ev’ry drug store;
Why don’t someone bother to look,
My central tells me all day long
“Sorry the number is wrong.”
