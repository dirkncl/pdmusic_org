1. Wishing is goodtime wasted
Still it’s a habit they say
Wishing for sweets I’ve tastted
That’s all I do all day
Maybe there’s nothing in wishing
But speaking of wishing I’ll say

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Nothing could be fin er
than to be in Carolina in
the morning
Noone could be sweeter
than my sweetie when I meet her
in the morning
Where the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girllie
where the dew is pearly
early in the morning
Butterflied all flutter up
and kiss each little butter cup
at dawning
If I had Aladdin’s lamp for only a day
I’d make a wish and here’s what I’d say
Nothing could be finer
than to be in Carolina
in the morning ­ing.

2. Dreaming was meant  for nighttime
I live in dreams all the day
I knew it’s not the right time
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming
Just dreaming and drifting away
