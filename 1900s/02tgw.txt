1.
When the night falls silenty, the night falls silently on forests dreaming,
Lovers wander forth to see, they wander forth to see the bright stars gleaming;
And lest they loose their way, lest they loose their way, the glow-worms nightly
Light their tiny lanterns gay, their tiny lanterns gay and twinkle brightly.
Here and there, and ev'rywhere, from mossy dell and hollow,
Floating, gliding through the air, they call on us to follow!

[REFRAIN]
Shine, little glow-worm, glimmer,
shine, little glow-worm, glimmer!
Lead us, lest too far we wander,
Love's sweet voice is calling yonder!
Shine, little glow-worm, glimmer,
shine, little glow-worm, glimmer!
Light the path, below, and above,
and lead us on to Love!

CHORUS ad lib.
Shine, little glow-worm, glimmer,
shine, little glow-worm, glimmer!
Lead us, lest too far we wander,
Love's sweet voice is calling yonder!
Shine, little glow-worm, glimmer,
shine, little glow-worm, glimmer!
Light the path, below, and above,
and lead us on to Love!


2.
"Little glow-worm, tell me pray, oh glow-worm, tell me pray, how did you kindle,
Lumps that by the break of day, that by the break of day, must fade and dwindle?"
"Ah, this secret, by your leave, this secret, by your leave, is worth the learning!
When true lovers come at eve, true lovers come at eve, their hearts are burning!
Glowing cheeks and lips betray, how sweet the kisses tasted!
Till we steal the fire away, for fear lest it be wasted!"

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
