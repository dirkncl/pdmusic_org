1. Within a small room, cold and cheerless,
There sits a young woman alone,
Beside her a cradle stands empty,
While o’er it she sobs and moans,
“My husband he no longer loves me,
His love vanshed when baby died,
So I’ll leave him and our home forever,
And out in the cold world abide.”
She packs baby’s clothes in a bundle,
While tears slowly flow down her cheek,
 “I never would leave him, no never,
If only one kind word he’d speak.
Just then the door quickly is opened,
Her husband takes bundle away,
And he spreads the things out on the table,
While gently yo her he does say:

One little stocking for you, Nell,
One tiny blue shoe for me,
One baby’s wrap and her small lace cap,
We’ll share in memory,
One lock of hair is for you, dear,
See how the golden curl shines,
  And we’ll both keep
  Her smile as she sleeps,
For she’s the tie that binds.

2. In silence they gazed at each other,
Then softly his darling wife said:
“Today is our third anniversary,
Just three years ago we wed,
Remember the seat in the orchard,
Where we would meet day after day.
And ’twas there with your arms close about me,
You call me your queen of May.”
“And don’t you remember the parson,”
He cried with his face all aglow,
“I hear his voice saying: ‘God bless you,
You’ll be a good man to her, Joe.’”
Then closer they draw to each other,
“Ah darling” he said “won’t you stay
If it’s only in mem’ry of baby,
I promise I’ll never more say:
