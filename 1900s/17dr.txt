Deep river, my home is over Jordan, 
Deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into campground. 
Deep river, my home is over Jordan. 
Deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into campground. 
Oh don’t you want to go to that gospel feast, 
That promis’d land where all is peace? 
Oh deep river, Lord, I want to cross over into campground.
