Helen, thy beauty is to me 
Like those Nycean barks of yore 
That gentle o’er a perfumed sea 
The weary, wayworn wand’rer bore 
To his own native shore. 
On des perate seas long wont to roam. 
Thy hy acinth hair, thy classic face, 
Thy Na iad airs, have brought me home 
To the glory that was Greece, 
To the grandeur that was Rome. 
Lo! in yon brilliant window niche 
How statuelike I see thee stand. 
The agate lamp within thy hand; 
Ah Psyche. 
From the regions which 
Are holy land!
