"The Purple and White" (1913)
by George T. Goldthwaite

1.
When Deering felt the duty to own
A flag for its beauty alone,
She took a color that her aim
And noble purpose bid her claim,
The purple of a kingly throne
And zealous in endeavor to see
The Light of Truth wherever it be,
The choice of white she quickly made
To place beside the Purple shade
And make a banner dear to me.

CHORUS (sung after each verse)
Be loyal to the Purple!
Be loyal to the White!
Emblem of the noble
And of Truth and Right.
Bear your colors proudly,
And raise them to the sky;
Conquer by the might
Of the Purple and White,
For the honor of Deering High.

2.
On field and plain none braver can try
To make the foeman waver and fly
For many a heroes we must have sent
Abroad upon this continent,
To battle for Deering High
In ev'ry composition of brain,
Our thorough erudition is plain,
Deering spirit evermore!
Deering colors to the fore,
And lead us in the van again.
