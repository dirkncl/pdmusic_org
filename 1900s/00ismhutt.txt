Dedicated to The Browning Society of Boston.
"I Send My Heart up to Thee!" (1900)
Words by Robert Browning, 1812-1889
Music by Amy Marcy Cheney Beach, 1867-1944
from "Three Browning Songs, Op. 44" [No. 3]

I send my heart up to thee, all my heart
In this my singing.
For the stars help me, and the sea,
and the sea bears part;
I send my heart up to thee, all my heart
In this my singing.
For the stars, the stars help me,
and the sea bears part;
The very night is clinging
Closer to Venice' streets to leave one space
Above me, when thy face
May light my joyous heart to thee,
to thee its dwelling place, thy face
May light my joyous heart to thee,
my heart to thee its dwelling place.
I send my heart up to thee, all my heart
In this my singing.
