1.
Over hill, over dale,
We have hit the dusty trail,
And those caissons go rolling along.
“Count-er march! Right about”
Hear those wagon soldiers shout,
While those caissons go rolling along.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For it’s Hi! Hi! Hee! in the Field Artillery,
Call off your numbers loud and strong
(Call off)
And where-e’re we go
You will always know
That those caissons are rolling along.
(Keep ’em rolling)
That those caissons are rolling along.

[After Last Chorus]
Batt’ry Halt!

2.
To the front, day and night
Where the doughboys dig and fight
And those caissons go rolling along.
Our barrage will be there
Fired on the rocket’s glare
While those caissons go rolling a-long.
