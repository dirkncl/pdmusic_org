1. 
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They had a quarrel one day,
Johnny he vowed that he would leave her
Said he was goin’ away,
He’s never comin’ home,
He’s goin’ away to roam.
Frankie she begged and pleaded
Cried oh Johnny please stay,
She says my honey I have done you wrong,
But please don’t go away
Then Johnny sighed, 
And to his Frankie cried.

CHORUS for Verses 1, 2 & 4.
“Oh, I’m agoin’ away
and I’m agoin’ to stay
I’m never comin’ home
You’re goin’ to miss me hon’,
in the days to come,
When the winter winds begin to blow
The ground is covered up with snow
You’ll think of me
and you will wish to be
Back with your lovin’ man
You’re goin’ to miss me hon’,
in the days, days, days to come.
Oh, I’m a ­ _

CHORUS for 3rd Verse.
“Oh, you’re agoin away
and you’re agoin’ to stay
you’re never comin’ home
I’m goin’ to miss you hon’,
in the days to come
When the winter winds begin to blow
The ground is covered up with snow
I’ll think of thee
and I will wish to be
Back with my lovin’ man
I’m goin’ to miss you hon’,
in the days, days, days to come.

2. 
Frankie say “listen now Johnny
To prove my love is true,
Every dollar I can save dear
I’m goin to give to you
So I think now dear,
That ought to keep you here”
Johnny says “listen now Frankie
Don’t want to tell you no lie,
I’ve lost my heart to another queen,
Her name is Nelly Bly”
Then Frankie groaned,
As her Johnny moaned.

3. 
Frankie then said to her Johnny
“Say man your hour has come,”
From underneath her silk kimona
She drew a fourtyfour gun
Oh it was a bear,
’Twas quite a large affair.
Johnny he dashed down the stairway
Cryin’ “Oh Frankie don’t shoot”
Frankie took aim with her “Fourtyfour”
Five times with a rootytoottoot
As Johnny fell,
Then Miss Frankie yelled.

4. 
“Send for your rubber tired hearses
Go get your runber tired hacks,
Take lovin Johnny to the graveyard
I shot him in the back
With my great big gun,
Just as he went to run,
Send for a thousand policemen
Detectives right away
Lock me way down in the dungeon cell
And throw the keys away
My Johnny’s dead,
Just because he said.”
