VERSE [sung twice]
That beauty spot you carry Cielito Lindo
Makes you look fine,
Give it to no one else my Cielito Lindo
Because it’s mine. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay!
Let’s sing a love song
For when our hearts sing together
Cielito Lindo
Love comes along.

[Original Mexican lyrics:]
VERSE [sung twice]
Ese lunar Quetienes Cielito Lindo
Junto a la boca
No se lo des a na die Cielito Lindo
Que a me ne toca.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay!
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se a legran Cielito Lindo
Los corazones.
