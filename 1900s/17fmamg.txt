1. What a beautiful day,
For a wedding in May,
See the people all stare
At the lovable pair,
She’s a vision of joy,
He’s the luckiest boy,
In his wedding array,
Hear him smilingly say.

CHORUS [sung twice for each VERSE]
The bells are ringing for me and my gal,
The birds are singing for me and my gal,
Ev’rybody’s been knowing
To a wedding they’re going,
And for weeks they’ve been sewing,
Ev’ry Susie and Sal,
They’re congregating for me and my gal,
The Parson’s waiting for me and my gal,
And sometime, I’m goin’ to build a little home for two,
For three or four, or more;
Is Loveland
For me and my gal.

2. See the relatives there,
Looking over the pair,
They can tell at a glance,
It’s a loving romance,
It’s a wonderful night,
As the fam’lies unite,
Gee! it makes the boy proud,
As he says to the crowd.
