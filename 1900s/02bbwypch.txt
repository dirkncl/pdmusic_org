"Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?" (1902)
Words and Music by Hughie Cannon

1.
On one summer day...
Sun was shining fine...
The lady love of old Bill Bailey was
hanging clothes on de line
in her back yard...
and weeping hard...
She married a B. and G. brakeman,
Dat took and throw'd her down.
Bellaring like a prune-fed calf,
wid a big gang hanging 'round;
And to dat crowd...
She yelled out loud:...

CHORUS
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey,
won't you come home?
She means de whole day long;...
I'll do de cooking, darling, I'll pay de rent:
I know I've done you wrong;...
'Member dat rainy eve dat I drove you out,
Wid nothing but a fine tooth comb?
I knows I'm to blame; well ain't dat a shame?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?


2.
Bill drove by dat door...
in an automobile...
A great big diamond coach and fast-man,
hear dat big wench squeal "he's all alone."...
I heard her grown...
She holler'd thro' that door, --Bill Bailey, is you sore?
Stop a minute, won't you listen to me?
Won't I see you no more?" Bill winked his eye..
And her heard her cry:...

(CHORUS)
