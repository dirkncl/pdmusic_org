1. Folks in Geogia’s ’bout to go insane
Since that new dance down in Georgia came,
I’m the only person who’s to blame
I’m the party introduced it there, so!
Give me credit to know a thing or two
Give me credit for springing something new
I will show this little dance to you
When I do you’ll say that it’s a bear.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
First you put your two knees close up tight,
Then you sway ’em to the left, then you sway ’em to the right,
Step around the floor kind of nice and light,
Then you twis’ around and twis’ around with all your might,
Stretch your lovin’ arms straight our in space
Then you do the Eagle Rock with style and grace
Swing your foot way ’round then bring it back,
Now that’s what I call “Ballin the Jack,”

2. It’s being done at all the Cabarets,
All society now has got the craze,
It’s the best dance done in modern days
That is why I rave about it so,
Play some good Rag, that will make you prance
Old folks, young folks all try to do the dance,
Join right in now while you got the chance
Once again the steps to you I’ll show.
