I realize within your eyes for me there lies a paradise
What other bliss is like a kiss from pretty lips I idolize
You are so sweet and you are so neat
A girl like you I'd never meet
Just to behold you is a treat that's hard to beat

Nothing I do can show how true I am to you, my only one
Cuddle up near and let me hear a word to cheer your lonely one
Your winning style my heart beguiles
For one sweet smile I'd walk a mile
Let me enfold you in my arms awhile

When you're near the birds sing in the trees pretty harmonies
All the world is humming a melody
When away from you I may be straying
Then my heart keeps saying
You're the heart of me, part of me, all of me
Nola, heed and listen while I plead, you're the one I need
Life for me is nothing but misery
Nola, Nola, hear your lonesome lovesick sweetheart calling Nola
