1. Bill collectors gather
’Round and rather
Haunt the cottage next door
Men the grocer and buther sent
Men who call for the rent
But within a happy chappy
And his bride of only a year
Seem to be so cheerful
Here’s an ear full
Of the chatter you hear.

CHORUS 1
Ev’ry morning
Ev’ry morning
Ain’t you got fun
Not much money
Oh but honey
Ain’t we got fun
The rent’s unpaid dear
We haven’t a bus
But smiles were made clear
For people like us
In the winter
In the summer
Don’t we have fun
Times are bum and getting bummer
Still we have fun
There’s nothing surer
The rich get richer and the poor children
In the meantime
In the meantime
Ain’t we got fun

2. Just to make their trouble
Nearly double
Something happen’d last night
To their chimney a graybird came
Mister Stork is his name
And I’ll bet two pins A pair of twins
Just happen’d in with the  bird
Still they’re very gay and merry
Just at dawning I heard.

CHORUS 2
Ev’ry morning
Ev’ry eveing
Don’t we have fun
Twins and cares dear
Come in pairs dear
Don’t we have fun
We’ve only started
As mommer and pop
Are we downhearted
I’ll say that we’re not
Landlords mad and getting madder
Ain’t we got fun
Times are bad and getting badder
Still we have fun
There’s nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get laid off
In the mean time
In between time
Ain’t we got fun
