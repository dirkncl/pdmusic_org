1.
One September I’ll remember,
Never to forget.
Battle weary Chateau Thierry,
That was where we met,
’Mong the ruins I still can see,
Suzette smiling out on me,
Somehow it just had to be;
This love that bids me tell you:

CHORUS [repeat afterr each verse]
There’s a girl in Chateau Thierry,
A girl who waits for me.
There’s a weary heart made cheery,
By love and victory.
And her buddy boy’s devotion,
Burns a trail across the ocean,
To Chateau Thierry, where she waits for me.

There’s a girl in Chateau Thierry,
A girl who waits for me.
There’s a weary heart made cheery,
By love and victory.
And her buddy boy’s devotion,
Burns a trail across the ocean,
To Chateau Thie-ry, where she waits for me, across the sea.

2.
Cherie, Cherie, I’m so very
Sad here over the sea,
Battle weary Chateau Thierry,
Seems much brighter to me,
Loved ones ask on ev’ry hand,
Why I’m sad in Yankee land,
Maybe they would understand
If I could only tell them:
