1. Honey dear, Want you near,
Just turn out the light and then come over here;
Nestle close Up to my side,
My heart’s a fire With love’s desire.
In my arms, rest complete,
I never thought that life could ever be so sweet
Till I met you, some time ago,
But now you know I love you so.

REFRAIN [sung twice after each VERSE]
Oh! you beautiful doll,
you great, big beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms around you,
I could nevver live without you;
Oh! you beautiful doll,
You great, big beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart will ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you’d break.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, you beautiful doll!

2, Precious prize, Close your eyes,
Now we’re goin’ to visit lover’s paradise;
Press your lips Again to mine,
For love is king Of ev’ry thing.
Squeeze me, dear, I don’t care!
Hug me just as if you were a grizly bear.
This is how I’ll go through life,
No care or strife When you’re my wife.
