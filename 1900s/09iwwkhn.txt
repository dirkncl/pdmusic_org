1.
You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long ago
And each one has meant Heaven to you.
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true.
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
They you've left her to hunt a new game.
Does it ever occur to you later my boy,
That she's probably doing the same?

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
I wonder who's kissing her now,
Wonder who's teaching her now,
Wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs, telling lies;
I wonder who's buying the wine,
For lips that I used to call mine.
Wonder if she ever tells him of me,
I wonder who's kissing her now.

2.
If you wantr to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
Just imaging the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed;
But the world moves a-pace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you never can tell who is kissing her now,
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.
