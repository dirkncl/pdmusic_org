1. When the golden sun sinks in the hills,
And the toil of a long day is o’er
Though the road may be long, in the lilt of a song
I forget I was weary before
Far ahead, where the blue shadows fall
I shall come to contentment and rest;
And the toils of the day will be all charmed away
In my little grey home of the west.

2. There are hands that will welcome me in—
There are lips I am burning to kiss—
They are two eyes that shine just because they are mine,
And a thousand things other men miss—
It’s a corner of heaven itself—
Though it’s only a tumbledown nest,
But with love brooding there, why, no place can compare
With my little grey home in the west.
