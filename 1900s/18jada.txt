1. You’ve heard all about your raggy melodies,
Ev’ry thing from opera down to harmony,
But I’ve a little song that I will sing to you,
It’s going to win you thru and thru.
There ain’t much to the words but the music is grand,
And you’ll be singing it to best the band.
Now you’ve heard of your “Will O’The Wisp,”
But give a little listen to this:
It goes

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Ja Da,
Ja Da,
Ja Da Ja Da Jing, Jing, Jing,
Ja Da,
Ja Da,
Ja Da Ja Da Jing, Jing, Jing,
That’s a funny little bit of melody
It’s so soothing and appealing to me,
It goes
Ja Da,
Ja Da,
Ja Da Ja Da Jing, Jing, Jing,

2. Now ev’ry one was singing a Hawaiian strain,
Ev’ry one seem’d to have it on their brain,
When Yaka Hicky Hoola Do was all the craze,
Why that’s the one that had them dazed.
The object now is far something new,
Something that will appeal to you,
And here’s a little melody that your will find,
Will linger, linger there in your mind:
It goes
