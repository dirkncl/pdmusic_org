1. I'd like to make your golden dreams come true, dear,
If I only had my way,
A paradise this world would seem to you, dear,
If I only had my way.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
If I had my way, dear, forever there’d be
a garden of roses for you and for me,
A thousand and one things, dear
I would do,
Just for you, just for you, just for you.
If I had my way we would never grow old,
And sunshine I’d bring ev’ry day,
You would reign all alone, like a queen on a throne,
If I had my way.

2. You’d never know a care, a pain, or sorrow,
If I only had my way,
I’d fill your cup of happiness tomorrow,
If I only had my way.
