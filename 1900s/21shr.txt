1. Father has a bus’ness
Strictly secondhand
Ev’rything from tooth picks
To a baby grand
Stuff in our apartment
Came from Father’s store
Even things I’m wearing
Someone wore before
It’s no wonder that I feel abused
I never have a thing that ain’t been used
I’m  wearing

[sing BOTH CHORUSES after each VERSE]
CHORUS 1
Second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That’s why they call me second hand Rose
Even our piano in your parlor
Father bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls I’m wearing seccond hand curls
I never get a single thing that’s new
Even Jake the plumber, he’s the man I adore
Had the nerve to tell me he’s been married before
Ev’ryone knows that I’m just
Second hand Rose
From Second Avenue.
I'm wearing

CHORUS 2
Second hand shoes
Seccond hand hose
All the girls hand me their second hand beaux
Even my pajamas when I don I’m wearing ’em
Have somebody else’s ’nitials on ’em
Second hand rings
I’m sick of second hand things
I never get what other girlies do
Once while strolling thru the Ritz a girl got my goat
She nudged her friend and said oh! look,
There’s my old fur coat
Ev’ryone knows that I’m just Second hand Rose
From Second Aven­ue.

2. Each one in the fam’ly
Kicks the whole day long
Ev’ryone’s disgusted
Ev’rything is wrong
Secong handed doggie
Second handed cat
Second handed welcome
Second handed mat
I think father’s head is made of wood
He brings home lots of things that ain’t no good
I'm wearing
