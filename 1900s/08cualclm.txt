1. On the Summer shore,
Where the breakers roar,
Lovers sat on the glistning sand.
And they talked of love,
While the moon above,
And the stars seemed to understand.
Then she grew more cold,
And he grew more bold,
Till she tho’t that they had better go.
But altho’ he heard,
He not even stirred,
Only murmured in tones soft and low.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Cuddle up a little closer, Lovey mine.
Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine.
Like to feel your cheek so rosy,
Like to make you comfy, cosy,
Cause I love from head to toesie Lovey mine.

2. Then she deigned to rest,
On his manly chest,
Her dear head with its flowing curls.
And she said, “I’d stay,
On this lap for aye,
How I envy the Copland girls.
For Miss Esquimaus,
’Mid the ice and snow,
Has no steamheat when he comes to call.
Not a single glim,
So it’s up to him,
To whisper in summer or fall.”
