1.
With war on ev'ry side of us our nation great and grand,
To guide the Ship of State aright, will need a master hand,
The cry goes up in this great land of freedom "dearly won,"
Bring forth some one to bear the flag, a man to lead us on!

REFRAIN
Give us just another Lincoln, or a Thomas Jefferson,
Give to us a Grant or Jackson, whose fame lives on and on,
One who's loyal to his country, One whose work when done
Shall be beloved by all the nation, As they loved George Washington.

2.
The mother in her humble home thinks of her boy in blue,
Who fights in some far distant land, to his country ever true,
She loves the flag, also her boy, from whom she had to part,
But war broke up her little home, and also broke her heart!

(REFRAIN)
