It's three o'clock in the morning,
We've danced the whole night thru,
And daylight soon will be dawning,
Just one more waits with you,
That melody so entrancing,
Seems to be made for us two,
I could just keep right on dancing
forever dear with you.

There goes the three o'clock chime,
chiming rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time,
Sounds like an old sweet love tune,
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon.

It's three o'clock in the morning,
We've danced the whole night thru,
And daylight soon will be dawning,
Just one more waltz with you,
That melody so entrancing,
Seems to be made for us two,
I could just keep right on dancing
forever dear with you.
