1. I’m dreaming dreams
I’m scheming schemes
I’m building candles high
They’re born anew
their days are few
Just like a sweet butterfly
And as the daylight is dawning
They come again in the morning.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I’m forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune’s always hiding
I’ve looked ev’rywhere
I’m forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air. I’m forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune’s always hiding
I’ve looked ev’rywhere
I’m forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air.

2. When shadows creep
When I’m asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak
when I awake
My blue bird flutters away
“Happiness you seem so near me
Happiness comes forth and cheer me”
