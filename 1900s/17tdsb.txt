1. I’ve got some good news, Honey,
An invitation to the Darktown Ball,
It’s a very swell affair,
All the “highbrows” will be there,
I’ll wear my high silk hat and my frock tail coat,
You wear your Paris gown, and your new silk shawl,
There ain’t no doubt about it babe,
We’ll be the best dressed in the ball.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I’ll be down to get you in a Taxi honey
You better be ready about halfpast eight,
Now dearie, don’t be late,
I want to be there when the band starts playing
Remember when we get there, Honey,
The two steps I’m goin’ to have ’em all,
Goin’ to dance out both my shoes:
When they play the “Jelly Roll Blues”
Tomorrow night, at the Darktown Strutters’ Ball.

2. We’ll meet our hightoned neighbors,
An exhibition of the “Baby Dolls,”
And each one will do their best,
Just to outclass all the rest,
And there’ll be dancers from ev’ry foreign land,
The classic, buck and wing, and the wooden clog:
We’ll win that fifty dollar prize,
When we step out and “Walk the Dog.”
