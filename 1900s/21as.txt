1. Life is not a highway strewn with flowers, 
Still it holds  a goodly share of bliss, 
When the sun gives way to April showers, 
Here’s the point that you should never miss. 

REFRAIN [sung twice after each verse]
Though April showers may come your way, 
They bring the flowersthat bloom in May 
So if it’s raining, have no regrets 
Because it isn’t raining rain you know, 
(It’s raining violets,) 
And where you see clouds upon the hills, 
You soon will see crowds of daffodils, 
So keep on looking for a blue bird 
And list’ning for his song, 
Whenever April showers come along. 

2. I have learned to smile when skies are gloomy, 
Smile although my heart’s about to break, 
When I know that trouble’s coming to me, 
Here’s the happy attitude I take.
