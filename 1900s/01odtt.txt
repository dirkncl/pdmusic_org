1. O dry those tears,
And calm those fears,
Life is not made for sorrow;
’Twill come, alas!
But soon ’twill pass,
Clouds will be sunshine to morrow;
’Twill come, alas!
But soon ’twill pass,
Clouds will be sunshine tomorrow.

2. O life thine eyes
To the blue skies,
See how the cloudss do borrow
Brghtness, each one,
Straight from the sun;
So is it ever with sorrow.
’Twill come, alas!
But soon ’twill pass,
Clouds will be sunshine tomorrow;
Then life thine eyes
To the blue skies.
Clouds will be sunshine tomorrow.
