"Let Me Call You Sweetheart" (1910)
(I'm in Love with You)
Words by Beth Slater Whitson
Music by Leo Freidman

1.
I am dreaming Dear of you
Day by day
Dreaming when the skies are blue
When they're gray;
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams
Still I wander on in dreams
In a land of love, it seems
Just with you.

CHORUS 2 times [p-f]
Let me call you "Sweetheart" I'm in love with you.
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.
Keep the lovelight glowing in your eyes so true.
Let me call you "Sweetheart" I'm in love with you.

2.
Longing for you all the while
More and more
Longing for the sunny smile,
I adore;
Birds are singing far and near
Roses blooming ev'rywhere
You, alone, my heart can cheer
You just you.

(CHORUS 2 times)
