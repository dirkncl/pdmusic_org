1. Ninetime am a fallin’ ev’rything is still,
And the moon am a shining from above,
Cupid am a callin’ ev’ry Jack and Jill,
It’s just about the time for making love.
Someone is awaiting all alone for me,
No more hesitating I must go and see.
How de do dear, it’s with you dear,
That I love to be.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Put your arms around me honey, hold me tight,
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might,
Oh, babe, Won’t you roll dem eyes,
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me my heart begins to float,
Then it starts arockin’ like a motor boat
Oh: oh: I never knew any girl like you.

2. Music am a playin’ such a “lovin’ glide,”
That my feet keep a moving to and fro,
And with you a swayin’ I’ll lie satisfied,
To dance untill we hear the roosters crow.
I love seven ’leven I love chicken too,
Nearest thing to heaven is to be with you.
For I’m spoony, moony, loony,
But my love is true.
