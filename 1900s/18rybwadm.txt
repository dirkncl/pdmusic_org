1. Mammy mine,
Your little rollin’ stone that rolledd away;
strolled away;
Mammy mine,
Your rollin’ stone is rollin’ home today;
there to stay;
Just to see your smilin’ face,
Smile a welcome sign;
When I’m in your fond embrace,
Listem Mammy mine.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Rockabye your baby with a Dixie melody;
When you croon, croon a tune,
from the heart of Dixie.
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine,
Right on that Mason Dixie Line,
And swing it from Virginia,
to Tennessee with all the love that’s in yer.
“Weep no more my lady!”
sing that song again for me;
And “Old Black Joe”;
just as though you had me on your knee;
A million baby kisses I’ll deliver,
The minute that your sing the Swanee River;
Rockabye your rockabye baby
with a Dixie melody.

2. Any time,
I hear a Mammy sing her babe to sleep;
slumber deep;
That’t the time,
The shadows ’round my heart begin to creep;
and I weep.
Wonder why I went away,
What a fool I’ve been;
Take me back to yesterday,
In your arms again.
