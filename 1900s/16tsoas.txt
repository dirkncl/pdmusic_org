1. He knelt beside his trundle bed, 
His ev’ning prayers had just been said 
Then climbing to his father’s knee 
Said “Daddy, please tell me, 
Why ev’ry night before I sleep 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, 
What is a soul I’d like to know,” 
His father answered low.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
It’s the greatest gift God ever gave you, 
It’s far greater than you’ll ever know, 
It comes from above and is greater than love 
And it lives when your time comes to go.
It’s the kiss and caress of an Angel 
And the Heavens above is its goal.” 
Then the boy murmured “mother,” 
It can’t be no other, 
That°s the stoty of a soul.

2. Asleep at last and in his dreams, 
Across his path the pale moonbeams, 
And in its light he seems to see 
His mother tenderly 
Stretch forth her hands and whisper,“dear, 
I’m waiting, waiting for you here 
Where ev’ry soul at last must come 
When their life’s work is done.”
