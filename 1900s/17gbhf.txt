1.
Good-bye New York town, good-bye Miss Liberty,
Your light of freedom will guide us across the sea,
Ev’ry soldier’s sweetheart biding good-bye,
Ev’ry soldier’s mother drying her eye.
Cheer up we’ll soon be there,
Singing this Yan-kee air:

CHORUS 1
Good-bye *Broadway, Hello France,
We’re ten million strong,
Good-bye sweethearts, wives and mothers,
It won’t take us long,
Don’t you worry while we’re there,
It’s for you we’re fighting too,
So Good-bye Broadway, Hello France,
We’re going to sqare our debt to you.

2.
Vive Pershing is the cry across the sea.
We’re united in this fight for liberty.
France sent us a soldier, brave La Fayette
Whose deeds and fame we cannot forget.
Now that we have the chance
We’ll pay our debt to France.

CHORUS 2
Good-bye *Broadway, Hello France,
We’re ten million strong,
Good-bye sweethearts, wives and mothers,
It won’t take us long,
Don’t you worry while we’re there,
It’s you we’re fighting for,
So Good-bye Broadway, Hello France,
We’re going to help you win this war.

*Name of any city may be substituted for Broadway if desired.
