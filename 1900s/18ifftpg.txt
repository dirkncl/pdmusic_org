In Flanders fields the poppies grow
Between the crosses, row on row,
  That mark our place, and in the sky,
  The larks, still bravely singing, fly,
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are dead; short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
  In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
  The torch; be yours to hold it high:
  If ye break faith with us to die,
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
  In Flanders fields.

    Lieut.-Colonel John McCrae,
                         Canadian Army
