1. I’ll sing to you a romance and play on my guitar;
’Tis of a darkeyed maiden, I worshipped from afar,
Each night beneath her lattice, while shadows darker grew,
I sang of love to her above, these tender words so true,
Come hearken now, and hear my vow, ’tis only thee I love,
The little rose lies next my heart, you cast dear from above,
Though far from thee I soon may be, to other lands may go,
I’ll not forget the Maid of Mexico.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Strolling along in the moon light, list to the strains of the band.
Roses and sweet Magnolias blossom on every hand.
Life here is one grand poem. Here is love’s own sweet land.
Life is all delightful down on the RioGrande.

2. ’Twas in a dim cathedral, while rang the vesper bell,
There in the dark old cloister, my love I then did tell
Shy eyes ’neath her mantilla, spoke love she dared not tell,
While soft and low I sang to her, this song she loved so well,
The night wind sighs and in thine eyes, thy answer dear I read,
Come to my heart, no more we’ll part, O do not let me plead,
’Mid love and flow’rs to spend life’s hours, and murmur soft and low,
I love you still sweet Maid of Mexico.
