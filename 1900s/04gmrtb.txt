"Give My Regards to Broadway" (1904)
One of the Musical Hits from Geo. M. Cohah's Latest Play
"Little Johnny Jones" (The Yankee Doodle Commedian)
Words and Music by George Michael Cohan, 1878-1942

1.
Did you ever see two Yankees part up on a foreign shore,
When the good ship's just around about to start for Old New York once more?
With tear-dimmed eye they say goodbye, they're friends without a doubt;
When the man on the pier
Shouts "Let them clear," as the ship strikes out.

CHORUS
Give my regards to Broadway, remember me to Herald Square,
Tell all the gang at Forty Second street, that I will soon be there;
Whisper of how I'm yearning,
To mingle with the old time throng,
Give my regards to old Broadway and say that I'll be there e'er long.

2.
Say hello to dear old Coney Isle, if there you chance to be,
When you're at the Waldorf have a smile and charge it up to me;
Mention my name ev'ry place you go, as 'round the town you roam;
Wish you'd call on my gal,
Now remember, old pal, when you get back home.

(CHORUS)
