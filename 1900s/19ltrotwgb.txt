1. In the struggle and strife
We find for this life
Really worthwhile, afterall?
I’ve been wishing today
I could just run away,
Out where the west winds call.

REFRAIN [sung twice after each VERSE]
With some one like you,
a pal good and true,
I’d like to leave it all behind,
and go and find
Some place that’s known to God above,
Just a spot to call our own.
We’ll find perfect peace,
When joys never cease,
Out there beneath the kindly sky, (kindly sky)
We’ll build a sweet little nest
somewhere in the west,
And let the rest of the world go by.

2. Is the future to hold
Just struggles for gold
While the real world waits outside,
Away out on the breast
Of the wonderful West,
Across the great Divide?
