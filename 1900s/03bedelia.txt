1. There’s a charming Irish lady with a roguish winning way,
Who has kept my heart a bumpin’ and a jumpin’ night and day,
She’s a flower from Killarney with a Tipperary smile,
She’s the best that ever came from Erin’s Isle
And I find myself a singing all the while

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Bedelia, I want to steal ye,
Bedelia I love you so,
I’ll be your Chauncey Olcott
If you’ll be my Molly O’,
Say something sweet Bedelia.
Your voice I like to hear,
O Bedelia, elia, elia,
I’ve made up my mind to steal ye,
steal ye, steal ye, Bedelia dear.

2. If you love me Bedelia half as much as I love you,
There is nothing in this world can ever cut your love in two,
For I’ll give you all my money on the day that we are wed,
I will cook for you and even bake the bread
And I’ll even bring your breakfast up to bed.
