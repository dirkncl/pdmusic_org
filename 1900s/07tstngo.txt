1. There is a story I’m longing to tell, 
Longing to tell you dearie; 
If in it’s glory with you I could dwell, 
Life would not seem so dreary, 
Just three little words to this story it’s true, 
But I’ll never tell it to any but you; 
Your eyes will decide when the stoty is through, 
If my heart’s to be light or weary.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
It’s a story that never grows old, 
It’s a story that’s often been told; 
It’s praise has been sung by pen and by tonque, 
Received and believed by the old and the young. 
The faintest of hearts will grow bold, 
When longing to have and to hold, 
I love you! I love you! I love you! 
Is the story that never grows old.

2. Clouds may be near in the heavens above, 
When there are hearts entwining; 
They’ll disappear in the sunshine of love, 
Bright with it’s silver lining. 
This stoty I tell, dear, forever will last, 
And when you are old, I will cling to you fast; 
I’ll tell it again as I did in the past, 
For your love I will still be pining.
