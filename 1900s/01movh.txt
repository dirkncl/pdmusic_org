1. ’Tis long long years since last I left
Dat old Virginia home
And thoughts of those days cheer me still,
While thinkin’ all alone,
I ’pears to see dem cotton fields
Where all de lib long day
We picjked de blossoms white and say
Dem piccaninies play.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
At my old Virginia home
My old Virginia home
I long to see dem same old fields
Where once I used to roam,
Each tune on de old banjo
Seems to ring out, “Uncle Joe,
Go back and see de place once moah,”
De old Virginia home.

2. How happy with my little wife
Our home was bright and gay
Till one sad mornin’ death came ’long
And stole my love away,
I long to see dat sacred spot
Where she sleeps all alone
’Neath the big white maple on the hill
At my old Virginia home.
