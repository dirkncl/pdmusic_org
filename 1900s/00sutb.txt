1. Jack is the King of the dark blue sea,
Jack is as brave as the brave can be,
He’s the boy, the girls adore,
Oh, what fun when Jack's ashore,
For he is the fellow can make things hum,
Oh how they sigh when they see him come,
Loaded down with gold so bright,
Welcome home Jack, you’re all right!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Strike up the band here comes a sailor,
Cash in his hand just off a whaler,
Stand in a row, don’t let him go,
Jack’s a cince, but ev’ry inch a sailor.

2. Jack on his ship o’er the sea has skimmed,
Jack on the sea has the sail well trimmed,
But when Jack is on the land,
He gets trimmed to beat the band,
For he has a sweetheart in ev’ry port,
Love to a sailor is rare old sport,
When he’s broke it’s Jack goodbye,
When he’s flush you’ll hear him cry.
