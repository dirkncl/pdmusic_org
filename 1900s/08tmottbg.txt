"Take Me Out To The Ball Game" (2 May 1908)
[Sung by Henry Fink.]
Words by Jack Norworth, 1879-1959
Music by Albert Von Tilzer, 1878-1956

1.
Katie Casey was baseball mad,
Had the fever and had it bad;
Just to root for the home town crew,
ev'ry sou -- Katie blew --
On a Saturday, her young beau called
to see if she if she'd like to go,
To see a show but Miss Kate said "no,
I'll tell your what you can do:" --

CHORUS 2 times
Take me out to the ball game,
Take me out with the crowd --
Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack,
I don't care if I never come back,
Let me root, root for the home team,
If they don't win it's a shame --
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
at the old ball game.

2.
Katie Casey saw all the games,
Knew the players by their first names;
Told the umpire he was wrong,
all along -- good and stong --
When the score was just two to two,
Katie Casey knew what to do,
Just to cheer up the boys she knew,
She made the gang sing this song: --

(CHORUS 2 times)
