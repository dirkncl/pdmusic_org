1. When the dawn flames in the sky,
    I love you;
When the birdlings wake and cry,
    I love you;
When the swaying blades of corn
Whisper soft at breaking morn
Love anew to me is born,
    I love you.

2. Dawn and dew proclaim my dream,
    I love you;
Chant the birds one thrilling theme,
    I love you;
All the sounds of morning meet,
Break in yearning at your feet,
Come and answer, come, my sweet,
    I love you.
