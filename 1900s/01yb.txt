   ADELINA, THE YALE BOOLA GIRL.

SENTIMENTAL.

   BOOLA.

Away, way down on the old Swaunee,
 Where the rippling waves are dancing to and fro,
The soft perfume from o'er the lea,
 Tells where sweet magnolia blossoms grow.
There's where my Adelina dwells,
 Mid fairy sylvan dells,
She laughs and sings the whole day through,
 Boola, Boo, Boola, 'oola, Boola, Boo!

 CHORUS.

 Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola,
 Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola.
 When I meet sweet Adelina,
 Then she sings her Boola song.
 Adelina, Adelina,
 I'll be waiting Adelina.
 When the silver moon is beaming;
 Then I'll meet you, Adline.

Her long and wavy nut-brown hair,
 Is tossing out upon the summer breeze,
Her sparkling eyes are wondrous fair,
 Her voice like the music 'mong the trees,
I ask her when she'll be my bride,
 Her head she turns aside,
And laughs and sings the whole day through,
 Boola, Boo, Boola, 'oola, Boola, Boo.--CHO.

    ATHLETIC.

BOOLA.

Well, here we are; well, here we are!
 Just watch us rolling up a score.
We'll leave those fellows behind so far,
 They won't want to play us any more!
We've hope and faith in Eli Yale!
 To win we cannot fail!
"Well, a Boola, Boo, Boola, Boola, Boo,
 Boola, Boo, Boola, 'oola, Boola, Boo!"

CHORUS.
 Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola,
 Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola,
 When we're through with those poor fellows,
  They will holler "Boola, Boo,
 Rah, Rah, Rah,
 Yale, Eli Yale,
 Oh, Yale, Eli Yale,
 Oh, Yale, Eli Yale,
 Oh, Yale, Eli Yale!"

Now isn't it a shame, now, isn't it a shame,
 To do those fellows up so bad?
We've done it before, we can do it once more,
 Though they'll feel very very sad.
We'll roll up the score so very high,
 That you will hear them sigh,
"Boola, Boola, Boo, Boola, Boola, Boo,
 Boola, Boo, Boola, 'oola, Boola, Boo!"

    COLLEGE.
  YALE BOOLA. TRIO:

Bright College Years with pleasure rife.
The shortest gladdest years of life,
How swiftly are you gliding by
Oh why doth time so quickly fly?
The seasons come, the seasons go.
The earth is green, or white with snow,
But time and change shall nought avail
To break the friendships formed at Yale!

We all must leave this College Home,
About the stormy world to roam,
But though the mighty ocean's tide,
Should us from dear old Yale divide,
As round the ivy twines,
The clinging tendrils of its vines,
So are our hearts close bound to Yale,
By ties of love that ne'er shall fail.

In after years should trouble rise,
To cloud the blue of sunny skies,
How bright will seem through memory's haze,
The happy, golden by-gone days,
Oh, let us strive that ever we
May let these words our watch-cry be,
Where'er upon life's sea we sail,
"For God, for Country, and for Yale!"
