1. Now look here Mister Jenkins you’ve been telling fairy tales
You said when we were married you’d have money stacked in bales.
You said you’d buy the Waldorf, the St. Regis Hotel too.
You promised me some diamonds and some other things you know
You said you had an auto that your summer home’s a dream
Those, five cent Cremos make you rich you’d better change the cream.
Now Liza don’t you grumble just because you’re poor don’t sigh.
The rich folks have their worries just the same as you and I.

CHORUS 1
Russell Sage eats apples for his dinner.
Morgan’s always worried ’bout his dough,
Vanderbilt is chased by summons server.
Rockefeller can’t eat pie you know.
Oh, Astor has to have a change of climate.
(Oh) Hetty Green must live her life alone.
So just thank your lucky stars
You can ride in trolley cars
Ev’ry dollar carries trouble of its own.

2. If you were rich you’d have to worry ’bout your help each day.
And keep a yacht for summer friend to pass their time away.
You’d have to pay your taxes and go out collecting rent.
Your gas bills would be over charged they’d squeeze you to a cent
You’d have to help your relatives or else you would be shunned
Each ’lection time you’d have to donote to the campaign fund.
Now what we have is all our own my ten per week is sure.
Three square a day, a place to star is ours altho we’re poor.

CHORUS 2
Roosevelt always has to feel delighted.
Bryan must drop silver for a year.
Misses Cassie Chadwick hasn’t left us.
She’s just resting easy, have no fear.
Oh, Chaunce Depew’s gold won’t buy him a baby.
The Czar just had to steal one for his throne.
But the trust’s woes are the worst
They fear William Randolf Hearst
Ev’ry dollar carries trouble of its own.
