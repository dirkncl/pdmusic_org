1. On the old farm house veranda
There sat Silas and Miranda,
Thinking of the days gone by.
Said he “Dearie don’t be weary,
you were always bright and cheery.
But a tear, dear, dimes you eye.”
Said she “there’re tears of gladness Silas,
there’re not tears of sadness,
It is fifty years today since were were wed.”
Then the old man’s dim eyes brighten’d,
And his stern old heart it lighten’dm
As he turn’d to her and said,

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
"Put on your old grey bonnet
with the blue ribbon on it,
While I hitch old Dobbin to the shay,
And through the fields of clover,
We’ll drive up to Dover
on my golden Wedding day."

2. It was in the same old bonnet
With the same blue ribbon on it,
In the old shay, by his side,
That he drove her up to Dover
thro’ the same old fields of clover,
To become his happy bride.
The birds were sweetly singing
And the same old bells were ringing,
As they pass’d the quaint old
church where they were wed.
And that night when stars were gleaming,
The old couple lay a dreaming
Dreaming of the words he said,
