1.
Darling 'mong the pines of Maine I spent my childhood,
Where the pretty birds were singing all the day,
Many hours I spent a-roaming thro' the wildwood,
'Neath the apple trees I'd often swing and play,
Many roses sweet and fair were blooming in the garden there,
As the years passed by when stars shone up above;
I would dream of days to come, when, I'd have a little home,
And the nicest girl in all the world to love.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
I never knew the fragrance of the blushing rose dear,
I never felt the lovely moonbeam's soft caress,
I never knew the joy of living Heaven knows dear,
Until your presence filled my life with happiness,
I never knew the little birds could sing so sweetly
I never knew the stars so brightly shone above,
Truly darling you have changed my world completely
'Till I met you, I never knew of love sweet love.

2.
And so happily we glide in our canoe dear,
While the twilight shadows steal across the sky,
Once again let's whisper of our love so true dear,
Of the blissful days a-coming bye and bye,
'Till the stars refuse to shine you'll be me Queen sweetheart of mine,
'Till the sunbeams to brighten skies of blue;
Till the snads along the shore by the waves are kiss'd no more,
All the love that's in my heart I'll give to you.
