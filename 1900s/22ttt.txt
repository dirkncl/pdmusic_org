1. Yesterday I heard a lover sigh,
“Goodbye oh me, oh my”
Seven times he got aboard his train
And seven times he hurries back
to kiss his love again, and tell her:—

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
“Toot, toot, Tootsie, Goo’ Bye!
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don’t cry,
The choo choo train that takes me,
Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me,
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then,
Do it over again,
Watch for the mail,
I’ll never fail,
If you don’t get a letter then you’ll know I’m in jail,
Tut, tut, tootsie don’t cry,
Toot, toot, Tootsie, Goo’ Bye!”
Tootsie, Goo’Bye!

2. When somebody says goodbye to me,
I’m sad as I can be,
Not so with this loving Romeo,
He seemed to take a lot of pleasure
saying byebye to his treasure:—
