Sung with Great Success by Stewart & Gillen
"In the Good Old Summer Time" (1902)
Waltz Song
Words by Ren Shields
Music by George Evans

1.
There's a time in each year
that we always hold dear,
  Good old summer time;
With the birds and the treeses
and sweet scented breezes,
  Good old summer time,
Whe your day's work is over
then you are in clover,
  and life is one beautiful rhyme,
No trouble annoying,
each one is enjoying,
  The good old summer time.

CHORUS 'mp'
In the good old summer time,
  In the good old summer time,
Strolling thro' the shady lanes,
  With your baby mine;
You hold her hand and she hold yours
  And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey wootsey in
  The good old summer time.

(CHORUS 'ff')

2.
To swim in the pool,
you'd play "hooky" from school,
  Good old summer time;
You'd play "ring-a-rosie"
with Jim, Kate and Josie,
  Good old summer time,
Those days full of pleasure,
we now fondly treasure,
  when we never thought it a crime,
To go stealing cherries,
with face brown as berries,
  Good old summer time.

(CHORUS 'mp')
(CHOURS 'ff')
