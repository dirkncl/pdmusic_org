1. Hello, there, stanger! how do you do?
There’s something I’d like to say to you
Don’t be surprised,
You’re recognized!
I’m no detective but I’ve just surmised.
You’re from the place where I long to be,
Your smiling face seems to say to me,
You’re from my own land,
My sunny homeland,
Tell me can it be?

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Are you from Dixie?
I said from Dixie!
Where the fields of cotton beckon to me?
I’m glad to see you,
Tell me how be you
And the friends I’m longing to see.
If you’re from Alabama, Tennessee or Caroline
Any place below the Mason Dixon line
Then you’re from Dixie,
Hurrah for Dixie!
’Cause I’m from Dixie too!

2. It was away back in eighty nine,
I crossed the old Mason Dixon line.
Gee! but I’ve yearned,
Longed to return
To all the good old pals I left behind.
My home is way down in Alabam’
On a plantation near Birmingham,
And one thing’s certain,
I’m surely flirtin’
With those southbound trains:
