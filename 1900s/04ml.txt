1.
Swing low, sweet chariot,”
Low enough to give some heav’nly rest,
To dis poor restless little one
Dat sobs on Mammy’s breast.

2.
“Swing low, sweet chariot,”
Wid your load of angels snowy drest,
And throw a dream out to de chile
‘Most sleep on Mammy’s breast.

3.
“Swing low, sweet chariot,”
So dat she may look into de nest,
An’ see how sound her baby sleeps
At last on Mammy’s breast.
