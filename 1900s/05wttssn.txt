"Wait 'Till the Sun Shines, Nellie" (1905)
Words by Andrew B. Sterling, 1874-1955
Music by Harry Von Tilzer, 1872-1946

1.
On a Sunday Morn, sat a maid forlorn,
With her sweetheart by her side;
Thro' the window pane, she looked at the rain,
"We must stay home Joe," she cried;
There's a picnic too, at the Old Point View,
It's a shame it rained to day, 
Then the boy drew near, kiss away each tear,
And she heard him softly say.

CHORUS 2-times
"Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie,
When the clouds go drifting by,
We will be happy Nellie,
Don't you sigh;
Down lover's lane we'll wander,
Sweethearts you and I;
Wait 'till the sun shines Nellie,
Bye and bye."

2.
"How I long," she sighed, "for a trolley ride,
Just to show my brand new gown,"
Then she gazed on high with a gladsome cry,
for the sun came shining down.
And she looked so sweet, on the big front seat,
As the car sped on its way,
And she whispered low, "Say, you're all right Joe,
You just won my heart today."

(CHORUS 2-times)
