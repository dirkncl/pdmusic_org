1. 
Every morning at six o’clock I go to my work,  
Overcoat buttoned up ’round my neck no job would I shirk, 
Winter wind blows ’round my head cutting up my face, 
I tell you what I'd like to have my dear old father’s place. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Everybody works but father 
And he sits around all day, 
Feet in front of the fire 
Smoking his pipe of clay, 
Mother takes in washing 
So does sister Ann, 
Everybody works at our house but my old man.

2.
A man named Work moved into town, and father heard the news, 
With Work, so near my father started shaking in his shoes,  
When When Mister Work walked by my house he saw with great surprise, 
My father sitting in his chair with blinders on his eyes.

3.
At beating carpets father said he simply was immense, 
We took the parlor carpet out and hung it on the fence, 
My My mother said: “now beat it dear, with all your might and main,” 
And father beat it right back to the fire side again.
