1. Johnson Jones from Tennessee,
Father of sweet harmony,
Organized a Quartette, goodness me!
And they sang so wonderful,
Kindly let me tell you, when
It comes down to singing men,
I’ve just got to say again,
They’re wonderful!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Come on and hear that harmony sweet.
Come and have a musical treat,
From you head down to your feet,
You’ll be fairly hypnotized;
They harmonize most any old place,
Alto, Tenor, Baritone, Bass.
Ev’ry other chord
Is a message from the Lord,
When you hear old Johnson’s Quartette harmonize.

2. When you find you can’t afford
To be paying for your board,
You can find a meal in ev’ry chord;
And it’s most remarkable,
No one found their equal yet,
To go out and try to get
Men who sing like that Quartette,
Impossible.
