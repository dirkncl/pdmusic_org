1.
I'm the kid that's all the candy,
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,
I'm glad I am,--
CHO. (So's Uncle Sam.)
I'm a real live Yankee Doodle,
Made my fame and boodle,
Just like Mister Doodle did,
by riding on a pony.
I love to listen to the Dixie strain,
"I long to see the girl I left behind me;"
And that ain't a josh,
She's a Yankee, by gosh.
CHO. (Oh, say can you see
Anything about a Yankee that's a phoney?)


CHORUS [2 times]
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,
A Yankee Doodle, do or die;
A real live nephew of Uncle Sam's,
Born on the Fourth of July.
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,
She's my Yankee Doodle joy.
Yankee Doodle came to London,
Just to ride the ponies;
I am a Yankee Doodle Boy.

2.
Father's name was Hexikiah,
Mother's name was Ann Maria,
Yanks through and through.
CHO. (Red, White and Blue.)
Father was so Yankee-hearted,
When the Spanish war was started,
He slipped on his uniform
and hopped upon a pony.
My mother's mother was a Yankee true,
My father's father was a Yankee too;
And that's going some,
For the Yankees, by gum.
CHO. (Oh, say can you see
Anything about my pedigree that's phoney?)
