1. Each day I'll do (each day I'll do) 
a golden deed (a golden deed),
By helping those (By helping those) 
who are in need; (who are in need;)
My life on earth (My life on earth) 
is but a span, (is but a span,)
And so I'll do (And so I'll do) 
the best I can, (the best I can).

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Life's evening sun (Life's evening sun) 
is sinking low, (is sinking low,)
A few more days (A few more days) 
and I must go (and I must go)
To meet the deeds (To meet the deeds) 
that I have done, (that I have done,)
Where there will be (Where there will be) 
no setting sun. (no setting sun.)

[all Verses use similar "echo repeat" style as Verse 1]
2. To be a child 
of God's each day,
My light must shine
along the way;
I'll sing His praise
while ages roll,
And strive to help
some troubled soul.

3. The only life
that will endure,
is one that's kind
and good and pure;
And so for God
I'll take my stand,
Each day I'll lend
a helping hand.

4. I'll help someone 
in time of need,
And journey on
with rapid speed;
I'll help the sick
and poor and weak,
And words of kind-
ness to them speak.

5. While going down
life's weary road,
I'll try to lift
some trav'ler's load;
I'll try to turn
the night to day,
Make flowers bloom
along the way.
