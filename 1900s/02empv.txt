Introduced by Eulah Lee
Words and Music by Max Hoffman

1.
Hush! coon! don't step on a watermelon
hush! soon! you'll have all them chickens yellin',
Brush! by! softly for I'm gwine to seranade
my little turtle dove,
de moon am climbin' -- de banjos chimin'
While I'm singing to ma lady love.

CHORUS
Emalyne ma pretty Valentine,
You own this heart of mine --
so roll dem googoo eyes at me my honey Emalyn[e],
We'll live on love divine --
don't tred me down the line
ma babe ma Emalyne.

(CHORUS)

2.
Come! love! don't you hear the crikets calling
soon! you! know de rain may start a falling,
All! my! life I'll spend a lovin' you for
honey you have got me dead,
so come ma lady -- we'll marry maybe
And I'll kiss those lips of ruby red.

(CHORUS 2 times)
