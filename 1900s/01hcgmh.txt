1. Papa I’m so sad and lonely,
Sobbed a tearful little child.
Since dear mama’s gone to heaven,
Papa darling you’ve not smiled;
I will speak to her and tell her,
That we want her to come home;
Just you listen and I’ll call her
Through the telephone;

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hello Central, give me heaven,
For me mama’s there;
You can find her with the angels
on the golden stair;
She’ll be glad it’s me who’s speaking,
call her, won’t you please;
For I want to surely tell her,
We’re so lonely here.

2. When the girl received this message,
Coming o’er the telephone,
How her heart thrilled in that moment,
And the wires seemed to moan;
I will answer just to please her,—
Yes, dear heart, I’ll soon come home;
Kiss me, mama, kiss your darling,
Through the telephone;
