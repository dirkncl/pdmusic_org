1. God speed our own brave soldier boys,
Who march to war away,
There’s a fight to fight, a cause to win,
A ruthless foe to slay,
And though a sob is in the throat
and our hearts are drear and sad.
We’ll win the fight, for “Right” is “Might”.
God speed our soldier lad!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
God speed! God heed! Boys of the U. S. A.,
The flag of stripes from starry heights,
Will Win For Us The Day!
Win For Us The Day!

2. Our boys go forth with wiling hearts,
For a cause that’s Right and Just!
Against a foe whose common aim
Is treason, death and lust,
Whose god is might, whose cruel sway
would Freedom’s sons enthrall.
But “Right” is “Might”, And the God We Trust,
Will Heed Our Country’s Call!
