1. I ain’t never seen such a monstrous change since the day that I was born,
As bounced up here in the las’ four weeks ’tween me an’ Miss Sally Horn
She par’ntly had a normal Constitution with good common sense to spare.
But since she’s been following the white folks they’ve put Miss Sally in the air.
My troubles they just started since at the big hotel she’s stayed.
A lady sent for her up there to come and be the maid
Where we used to go to the restaurant plain pork chops they would do
But now she wants a porter house steak with a bottle of champagne, too.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
She’s getting mo’ like the white folks ev’ry day
Trying to do just like ’em ev’ry way.
Once she was stuck on catico patterns,
Now all she wants is silks and satins,
She’s getting mo’ like the white folks e’ry day.

2. I knew at her home that she only had just one plain kind of meat,
Now she’s got to have two diff’rent kinds or else she cannot eat.
I know when chcken was a luxury she’d eat ’em boiled or fried.
Now she must have some humming birds hearts or else she aint satisfied.
She’s got herself some irons she’s been working on her hair.
She’s got herself some kalsomine to help to make her fair.
Now she can sing “The Swanee River” like it never was sung before.
But since she worked in that hotel she warbles “Il Trovatore”.
