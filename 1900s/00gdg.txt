1.
"I have come to say good-bye, Dolly Gray.
It's no use to ask me why, Dolly Gray.
There's a murmur in the air
You can hear it ev'rywhere
It is time to do and dare, Dolly Gray.
Don't you hear the tramp of feet, Dolly Gray.
Sounding thro' the village street, Dolly Gray.
'Tis the tramp of soldiers true
In their uniforms of blue,
I must say good-bye to you, Dolly Gray!"

REFRAIN [sung twice after each verse]
"Good-bye Dolly, I must leave you,
Tho' it breaks my heart to go,
Something tells me I am needed
at the front to fight the foe.
See the boys in blue are marching,
And I can no longer stay.
Hark! I hear the bugle calling,
Good-bye Dolly Gray!"

2.
Hear the rolling of the drums, Dolly Gray.
Back from war the reg'ment comes, Dolly Gray.
On your lovely face so fair
I can see a look of care
For your soldier boy's not there, Dolly Gray.
For the one you loved so well, Dolly Gray.
In the midst of battle fell, Dolly Gray.
With his face towards the foe
As he died he murmured low,
"I must say good-bye and go, Dolly Gray!"
