1. I got a gal,
I got a pal,
I got a chance,
I got a dance, waiting for me,
I’m goin’ to make, right to the lake,
There with the boys, in Illonois,
I want to be,
You may not care,
For to be there,
But I declare,
You’re not aware,
Just where to go,
When you’re in town,
Just call around, right there I’m found,
Really you ought to know:

2. Any old Maid,
Who’s not afraid,
Powders her nose, puts on nice clothes,
she’ll get a beau,
Any old Guy, ever in Chi,
He’s got a chance,
If he can dance,
He’ll cop a Flo,
Any Hotel,
That’s abit swell,
Must have a band,
Right here on hand, or else their cheap,
If you’ll invest,
You’ll find a guest, they’ll never rest,
They’re dancing while they sleep:

Chicago, Chicago,
That tod’dl’ing town,
Toddl’ing Town,
Chicago, Chicago,
I’ll show you around,
I love it,
Betch your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chigago, Chicago,
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On State Street,
That Great Street,
I just want to say,
Just want to say,
They do things
they do things on Broadway,
Say,
They have the time,
The time of their life,
I saw a man he danced with his wife, in Chicago,
Chicago, my home town.
[PATTER start]
In College Inn you get the real beer in a glass,
Is that college from Professor’s, you learn to jazz,
More Colored people up in State Street you can see,
Than you’ll see in Louisianna, or Tennessee,
They’ve got the “Stock Yards”
So I heard the people say,
I just got wind of it today, today,
On
[PATTER end]
State Street,
That Great Street,
I just want to say,
Just want to say,
They do things
they do things on Broadway,
Say,
They have the time,
The time of their life,
I saw a man he danced with his wife, in Chicago,
Chicago, my home town.
