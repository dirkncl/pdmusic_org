1. Come all you rounders if you want to hear 
a story a bout a brave Engineer 
Casey Jones was the Rounders name 
On a six eight wheeler boys he won his fame 
The caller called Casey at a half past four
kissed his wife at the station door 
mounted to the Cabin with his orders in his hand 
and he took his farewell trip to that promised land. 

[CHORUS] Casey Jones! [SOLO] mounted to the cabin 
[CHORUS Casey Jones [SOLO] with his orders in his hand 
[CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO} mounted to the cabin 
and he took his farewell trip to that Promised land.

2. Put in your water and shovel in your coal 
put your head out the winddow watch them drivers roll 
I’ll run her till she leaves  the rail 
Cause I’m eight hour late with that western mail 
He looked at his watch and his watch was slow 
he looked at the water and the water was low 
he turned to the Fire man and he said 
we’re going to reach Frisco but we’ll all be dead. 

[CHORUS] Casey Jones! [SOLO] going to reach Frisco 
[CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] but we’ll all be dead 
[CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] going to reach Frisco 
we’re going to reach Frisco but we’ll all be dead.

3. Casey pulled up that Reno hill 
he tooted  for the crossing with an awful shrill 
The switchmen knew by the engines moan 
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones 
He pulled up within two miles of the place 
number four stared him right in the face 
turned to the Fireman said Boy you’d better jump 
cause there’s two Locomotives thats a going to bump. 

[CHORUS] Casey Jones! [SOLO] two Locomotives 
[CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] thats a going to bump 
[CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] two locomotives 
there’s two locomotives thats a going to bump.

4. Casey said just before he died 
theres two more roads that I’d like to ride 
Fireman said what could that be 
The Southern Paciffic and the Sante Fe 
Mrs Jones sat on her bed a sighing 
just received a message that Casey was dying 
said go to bed children and hush your crying 
cause you got another papa on the Salt Lake line. 

Mrs [CHORUS] Casey Jones! [SOLO] got another papa 
Mrs [CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] on that Salt Lake Line 
Mrs [CHORUS] Casey Jones [SOLO] got another Papa 
and you’v got another Papa on that Salt Lake line.
