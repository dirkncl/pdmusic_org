"Good Morning, Mr. Zip-Zip-Zip!" (1918)
Written around a Fort Niagra Fragment
by Robert Lloyd, Army Song Leader

1.
We come from ev’ry quarter,
From North, South, East and West,
To clear the way to freedom
For the land we love the best.
We’ve left our occupations
and home, so far and dear,
But when the going’s rather rough,
We raise this song in cheer:

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,
With your hair cut just as short as mine,
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,
You’re surely looking fine!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,
If the Cam-ls don’t get you,
The Fatimas must,
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,
With your hair cut just as short as,
your hair cut just as short as,
your hair cut just as short as mine.

2.
You see them on the high-way,
You meet them down the pike,
In olive drab and khaki
Are soldiers on the hike;
And as the column passes,
The word goes down the line,
Good morning, Mister Zip-Zip-Zip,
You’re surely looking fine.
