1. When I was a boy my mother often said to me,
Get married boy and see, how happy you will be.
I have looked all over, but no girlie can I find,
Who seems to be just like the little girl I have in mind,
I will have to look around until the right one I have found.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad,
She was a pearl and the only girl that Daddy ever had.
A good old fashioned girl with heart so true,
One who loves nobody else but you,
I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad.

2. By the old mill stream there sits a couple old and gray,
Though years have rolled away, there hearts are young today.
Mother dear looks up at Dad with love light in her eye.
He steals a kiss, a fond embrace, while eve’ning breezes sigh,
There as happy as can be, so that’s the kind of love for me.
