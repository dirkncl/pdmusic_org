It’s the roar and rattle of Freedom’s battle
That’s calling us over the sea,
Where a mighty foe has challenged us, boys
It’s up to you and to me;
So get Old Glory, we’ll make ’em sorry
That they ever dreamed of this fight.
We’re on our way with a Hip! Hooray!
Just to do what we know to be right.

REFRAIN [to be sung twice]
So here’s to Uncle Sammy faithful and true;
Here’s to our banner of red, white and blue;
And here’s to all good fellows on land and sea
Singing the Battle Song of Liberty.
