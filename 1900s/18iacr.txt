VERSE
At the end of the rainbow there's happiness,
And to find it how often I've tried,
But my life is a race, just a wild goose chase,
And my dreams have all been denied.
Why have I always been a failure,
What can the reason be?
I wonder of the world's to blame,
I wonder if it could be me?

CHORUS [2 times]
I'm always chasing rainbows,
Watching clouds drifting by.
My schemes are just like all my dreams,
Ending in the sky.
Some fellows look and find the sunshine,
I always look and find the rain,
Some fellows make a winning sometime,
I never even make a gain,
Believe me, I'm alway's chasing rainbows,
Waiting to find a little blue bird in vain.
