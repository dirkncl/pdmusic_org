O Love Divine, that stooped to share
Our sharpest pang, our bitt’rest tear,
On Thee we cast each earthborn care,
We smile at pain while Thou, while Thou are near!
Though long the weary way we tread,
And sorrow crown each ling’ring year,
No path we shun, no darkness dread,
Our hearts, our hearts still whisp’ring, Thou art near!
When drooping pleasure turns to grief,
And trembling faith is changed to fear,
The murm’ring wind, the quiv’ring leaf
Shall softly tell us, Thou art near!
On Thee we fling our burd’ning woe
O Love Divine, forever dear,
Content to suffer while we know,
Living and dying, Thou art near,
Living, dying, Thou art near,
Living and dying, Thou art near!
