1.
The oreole with joy was sweetly singing,
The little brook was bab'ling its true,
The village bells at noon were gaily ringing.
The world seem'd brighter than a harvest moon;
For there within my arms I gently pressed you,
And blushing red, you slowly turned away,
I can't forget the way I once caressed you;
I only pray we'll meet another day.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
In the shade of the old apple tree,
Where the love in your eyes I could see,
When the voice that I heard, like the song of a bird,
Seem'd to whisper sweet music to me;
I could hear the dull buzz of the bee,
In he blossoms as you said to me,
With a heart that is true,
I'll be waiting for you,
In the shade of the old apple tree.

2.
I've really come along way from the city,
And though my heart is breaking I'll be brave,
I've brought this bunch of flow'rs I think they're pretty
To place upon a freshly moulded grave;
If you will show me, father, where she's lying,
Or if it's far just point it out to me,
Said he "she told us all when she was dying,
To bury her beneath the apple tree."
