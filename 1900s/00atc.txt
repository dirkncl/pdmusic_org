1. You receive a little missive, some one leaves it in the hall,
By the tint you know who wrote it, scent of violets over all;
And you break the seal and read it, “You may call tonight at eight,”
That is what it says, “Good Bye dear, from your loving little Kate.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
When you go out for a twilight call,
Whistling the latest air
Swinging along in an easy way,
Happy and free from care.
Hoping the sweet words you whisper tonight,
On willing ears may fall
When at the gate, lingering with Kate,
Making a twilight call.

2. How the daylight seems to linger, but at last ’tis candlelight,
And you trip away so happy while the stars are shining bright.
Then she sees you, turn the corner, gaily waves her hand at you
At the gate you’ll find her waiting, she’s your sweetheart good and true.
