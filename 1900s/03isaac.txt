"Ida! Sweet as Apple Cider" (1903)
Words by Eddie Leonard
Music by Eddie Munson

1.
In the region where the roses always bloom,
Breathing out upon the air their sweet perfume,
Lives a dusky maid I long to call my own,
For, I know my love for her will never die;
When the sun am sinkin' in dat golden West,
Little Robin Red Breast gone to seek their nests,
Then I sneek down to dat place I love the best,
Ev'ry ev'ning there alone I sigh.

CHORUS
Ida! sweet as apply cider,
Sweeter than all I know,
Come out! in the silv'ry Moonlight,
of love we'll whisper, so soft and low!
Seems tho'-- can't live without you,
Listen -- Oh! Honey do!
Ida! I idolize yer,
I love you Ida, 'deed I do.

2.
When the moon comes stealing up behind the hill,
Ev'rything around me seems so calm and stile,
Save the gentle calling of the Whipoor Will,
Then I long to hold her little hand in mine;
Thro' the trees the winds are sighing soft and low,
Seem to come and whisper that your love is true,
Come and be my own now, Sweetheart do! oh do!
Then my life will seem almost divine.

(CHORUS)
