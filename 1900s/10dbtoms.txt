"Down By the Old Mill Stream" (12 August 1910)
by Tell Taylor, 1876-1937

1.
My darling I am dreaming, of the days gone by,
When you and I were sweethearts, beneath the summer sky;
Your hair has turned to silver, the gold has faded too;
But still I will remember, where I first met you.

CHORUS 2 times
Down by the old  mill stream, where I first met you,
With eyes of blue, dressed in gingham too,
It was there I  knew, that you loved me true,
You were sixteen, my vilage queen, by the old mill stream.

2.
The old mill wheel is silent, and has fallen down,
The old oak tree has withered, and lies there on the ground;
While you and I are sweethearts, the same as days of yore;
Although we've been together, forty years and more.

(CHORUS 2 times)
