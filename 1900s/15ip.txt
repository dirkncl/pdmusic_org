"Inory Palaces" (1915)
Words and Music
by Henry Barraclough (1891-1983)

All Thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the
ivory palaces, whereby they have made Thee glad. Psalm 45:8 (KJV)

[Source: digitized copy sent by Dave Miller]

1. My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
With joy my being thrills. 

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into a world of woe,
Only His great eternal love
Made my Savior go.

2. His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.

3. His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.

4. In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav'nly home,
To dwell forevermore.
