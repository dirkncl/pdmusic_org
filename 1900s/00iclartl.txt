1. Got more trouble than I can stand, 
Ever since ragtime has struck the land— 
Never saw the like in all my days; 
Ev’ryone has got the rag-time craze; 
Stood it just as long as I could. 
At last I got it and I got it good; 
First I didn’t want any in mine, 
But now I’m right in line. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
I got a rag-time dog and a ragtime cat, 
A rag-time piano in my rag-time flat; 
Wear rag-time clothes, from hat to shoes, 
I read a paper called the “Rag-time News.” 
Got ragtime habits and I talk that way. 
I sleep in rag-time and I rag all day; 
Got rag-time troubles with my rag-time wife, 
I’m certainly living a rag-time life. 

2. Went to church last Sunday morn; 
Hymns were in rag-time as sure’s you’re born; 
Ev’ry gripman pounds it on his gong; 
Clocks and watches are all running wrong; 
Cakewalk music it fills the air. 
It can’t be dodged because it’s ev’rywhere; 
Once I didn’t belong, you see, 
But now you can’t lose me.
