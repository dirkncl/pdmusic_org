1. I am so lonely,
I am so blue,
I’m happy only
when I am with you.
Fame, friends, and fortune?
I have all three,
But there’s just one thing
that will comfort me.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Somebody’s sweetheart I, want to be,
Somebody’s heart beating all for me,
Somebody’s two arms around me
when I feel blue,
Somebody’s sweetheart,
and that means you.

2. Star up above me,
Listen to me,
I have a favor
I would ask of thee;
Should you when shining,
some fond heart see,
Be a good fellow,
guide that heart to me.
