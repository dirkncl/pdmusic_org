1. Little lily was oh so silly and shy,
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn’t bill and coo,
Every single night some smart fellow would try, To cuddle up to her,
But she would cry:

CHORUS 1 [sung twice]
“Ma” he’s making eyes at me,
“Ma” he’s awful nice to me,
“Ma” he’s almost breaking my heart,
I’m beside him,
Mercy let his conscience guide him;
“Ma” he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee,
Every minute he gets bolder,
Now he’s leaning on my shoulder,
“Ma” He’s kissing me. Me.

2. Lily was so good every body could tell,
You’d never see her roam,
She’d always stay at home,
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well,
For when the boys would call,
They’d hear her yell:

CHORUS 2 [sung twice]
“Ma” he’s making eyes at me,
“Ma” he’s awful nice to me,
“Ma” he’s almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in,
Can’t you see I’m goin’ to weakin’,
“Ma” he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee,
Ma I’m meeting with resistance,
I shall holler for assistance,
“Ma” He’s kissing me. Me.
