1. Far across the broad Atlantic in a land you know, 
Land of joy where dreams romantic softly come and go 
Twilight brings the shadows stealing thro a garden fair, 
Don Carlos his love appealing to a maiden there.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Beneath the Spanish moon he played his guitar, 
La la la lah, 
La la la lah, 
Beneath the Spanish moon he sang merrily, 
De de de dee, 
De de de dee, 
Beneath the Spanish moon a lovesong he’d strum, 
Dum dum dum dum, 
Dum dum dum dum 
And very soon, a wedding tune they will croon, 

2. When he sees the lovelight dancing in her wondrous eyes, 
When he hears here voice entrancing he finds paradise 
Then they learn the magic story ev’ry heart has vowed 
And the moon in all its glory hides behind a cloud.
