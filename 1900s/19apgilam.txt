"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" (1919)
Words and Music by Irving Berlin, 1888-1989

I have an ear for music,
And I have an eye for a maid
I link a pretty girlie,
With each pretty tune that's played.
They go forth together like sunny weather
Goes with the month of May --
I've studied girls and music,
So I'm qualified to say:

REFRAIN 2 times
A pretty girl is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain of a haunting refrain,
She'll start upon a marathon
And run around your brain,
You can't escape -- she's in your memory,
By morning, night and noon --
She will leave you and then come back again,
A pretty girl is just like a pretty tune.
