1. A mother less tot, once at Christmas, 
Sat on her dear Papa’s knee. 
Her presents no pleasure had brought her. 
Unhappy and tearful was she. 
“Won’t Santa bring back my dear Mamma. 
Oh! why is she always away?” 
He held her more closely and whispered: 
“She’s in Santa Claus land today.” 

2. Two dear little arms, soft and tender, 
Creep up in childish embrace. 
A sweet little voice softly whispers: 
“I’ll try and take dear Mamma’s place!” 
“God bless you! my darling,” he murmurs: 
As tears to his eyes swiftly rise. 
“And when the time comes, we’ll be ready 
To meet Mamma dear in the skies.”

She’s gone to the land of Santa Claus, 
Gone to his city of rest; 
She’s chosen these toys for you, dear one! 
Knowing just what you liked best. 
So dry up your tears and remember, love! 
Whatever betide, good or ill, 
Tho’ far, far away, there is never a day, 
That dear Mamma’s not watching us still.
