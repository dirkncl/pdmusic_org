1. I’m writing you dear, just to tell you
in September,
You remember
’Neath the old apple tree
You whispered to me
When it blossomed again you’d be mine
I’ve waited until I could claim you
I hope I’ve not waited in vain
For when it’s spring in the valley
I’m coming my sweetheart again

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I’ll be with you in apple blossomtime
Ill be with you to change your name to mine
One day in May
I’ll come and say
“Happy the bride the sun shines on today”
What a wonderful wedding there will be
What a wonderful day for your and me
Church-bells will chime
You will be mine
In apple blossom time. time.

2. I hope that you meant what you promised
in September,
You remember
And I’ve thought of the day I’d take you away
Just to have not to hold for my own
It’s such a long time since you kissed me
And told me that you would be true
But when the orchard is blooming
My sweetheart I’m coming to you
