"Over There" (1917)
Successfully Introduced by Nora Bayes
Words and Music George Michael Cohan, 1878-1942

1.
Johnnie get your gun, get your gun, get your gun
Take it on the run, on the run, on the run
Hear them calling you and me
Ev'ry son of liberty
Hurry right away no delay go today
Make your daddy glad to have had such a lad
Tell your sweetheart not to pine
To be proud her boy's in line.

CHORUS 2 times
Over there -- over there --
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tum-ming ev'rywhere --
So prepare
We'll be over we're coming over
And we won't come back till it's over over there.

2.
Johnnie get your gun, get your gun, get your gun
Johnny show the Hun you're a son of a gun
Hoist the flag and let her fly
Yankee Doodle do or die
Pack your little kit show your grit do your bit
Yankees to the ranks from the towns and the tanks
Make your mother proud of you
And the old Red White and Blue.

(CHORUS 2 times)
