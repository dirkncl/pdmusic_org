1.
Voices hum, crooning over Moonlight Bay,
Banjos strum, tuning while the moon beams play.
All alone, unknown they find me--
Memories like these remind me
Of the girl I left behind me,
Down on Moonlight Bay.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
We were sailing along
On Moonlight Bay,
We could hear the voices ringing,
They seemed to say
"You have stolen her heart,
Now don't go 'way!"
As we sang Love's Old Sweet Song,
On Moonlight Bay.

2.
Candle lights gleaming on the silent shore;
Lonely nights, dreaming till we meet once more.
Far apart, her heart is yearning,
With a sigh for my returning,
With the light of love still burning,
As in days of yore.
