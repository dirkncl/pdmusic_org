1. There’s a song in the land of the lily
Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh
  Over high garden walls
  This sweet echo falls
As a soldier boy whispers goodbye

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Smile the while you kiss me and adieu
When the clouds roll by I’ll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in lovers lane my dearie
Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev’ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again.

2. Tho’ goodbye means the birth of a teardrop
Hello means the birth of a smile
  And the smile will erase
  The tear blighting trace
When me meet in the afterawhile
