VERSE
Come cheer for Washington and Lee,
We’re going to win another victory,
The White and Blue we will ever wave
in triumph for the University,
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Right to the finish we are with you,
Break thru the line on ev’ry play,
Rush the ball on down the field and
we will win this game today.

CHORUS
When Washington and Lee’s men fall in line,
We’re going to win again another time,
For W. and L. I yell, yell, yell, yell, yell,
And for the University I yell, I yell like hell,
so fight, fight, fight, for ev’ry yard,
Circle the ends and hit the line right hard,
And roll _George-town’s men_ [V. P. I.] upon the sod
Rah! Rah! Rah!
