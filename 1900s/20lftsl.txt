[1] (Blair)
Please don’t be offended if I preach to you a while, 
Tears are out of place in eyes that were meant to smile. 
There’s a way to make your very biggest troubles small, 
Here’s the happy secret of it all. 

Burthen [CHORUS sung twice after each verse]
||: Look for the silver lining 
When e’er a cloud appears in the blue 
Remember somewhere the sun is shining 
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you. 
A heart full of joy and gladness 
Will always hanish sadness and strife 
So always look for the silver lining 
And try to find the sunny side of life. :||

[2] (Sally)
As I wash my dishes, I’ll be following your plan, 
Till I see the brightness in ev’ry pot and pan. 
I am sure your point of view will ease the daily grind, 
So I’ll keep repeating in my mind.
