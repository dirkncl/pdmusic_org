1. A preacher went out a hunting ’twas on one Sunday morn
Of course it was against his religion but he took his gun along,
He shot himself some very fine quail and one big measly hare
And on his way returning home he met a great big grizzly bear;
The bear marched out in the middle of the road and he waltzed to the coon you see,
The coon got so excited that he climed a persimmon tree
The bear sat down upon the ground and the coon climbed out on a limb,
He cast his eyes to the God in the skies and these words he said to him. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh Lord, didn’t you deliver Daniels from the Lion’s den?
Also deliver Jonah from the belly of the whale and then,
Three Hebrew children from the fiery furnace so the good books do declare
Now Lord if you can’t help me for goodness sake don’t you help that bear.

2. This coon stayed up in that tree I think it was all night,
He says, “Oh Lord” if you don’t help that bear then you’ll see one awful fight,
Just about then the limb let go and the coon came tumbling down,
You should have seen him get his razor out be fore he struck the ground,
He hit the ground cutting right and left, ’tis true he put up a very game fight,
Just then the bear hugged this coon he squeezed him a little too tight,
The coon he then lost his razor but the bear held on with a vim,
He cast his eyes to the God in the skies and once more he said to him.
