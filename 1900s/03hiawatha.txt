1. 
Oh the moon is all agleam on the stream 
Where I dream here of you my pretty Indian main. 
While the rustling leaves are singing high above us overhead 
In the glory of the bright summernight 
In the light and the shadows of the forest glade 
I am waiting here to kiss your lips so red. 
There's a flood of melodies on the breeze 
From the trees and of you they breathe so tenderly 
While the woodlands all around are resounding your name. 
Oh my all in life is you only you 
Fond and true and your own forevermore I'll be. 
Hear then the song I sing with lips aflame. 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
I am your own your Hiawatha brave; 
my heart is yours you know 
Dear one I love you so. 
Oh Minnehaha gentle maid decide, 
decide and say you’ll be, My Indian bride.

2. 
In the tresses of your hair, lies a snare and its there, 
Where my heart a willing captive is. 
Oh my woodland queen I pray you'll hold it ever in your care 
In my little birch canoe love with you 
Just we two down the stream of life in wedded bliss 
I would drift sweatheart with you my lot to share. 
When the birds upon the wing in the spring 
Gaily sing of the green and golden sum mer time 
When the snows of early winter robe the woodlands in white, 
Then your Hiawatha free I will be 
And to thee ev   ’ry thought of mine will e’er incline. 
Heed then the vows I pledge  to thee this night.
