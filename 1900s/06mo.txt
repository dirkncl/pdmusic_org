1. Ye men of God, to arms, to arms!
Oh, don’t you hear the bugle call?
From sinful hosts come dread alarms;
The foe to quell, go one and all.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
March on! march on!
For Jesus’ precious Name,
Against the evil pow’rs;
To right the wrong
And spread His fame,
That victory be ours,

2. “The win in Christ,” your motto grand.
Go forth with banner high in air;
If you in triumph take the land,
You must be firm to do or dare.

3. The foe is bold, in numbers strong,
You need to keep your armor bright;
Although the fight be fierce and long,
Stand firm to win for truth and right.

4. For God and home and those we love,
Be foremost in the battlefield;
To bear the palm in heav’n above,
Fight on until the foe shall yield.

4. For God and home and those we love,
Be foremost in the battlefield;
To bear the palm in heav’n above,
Fight on until the foe shall yield.
