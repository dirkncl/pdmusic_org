1. Oh! ask not why my cheek is pale,
Or why mine eye is dim,
Can the Lover smile, when she he loves;
Smiles bright on all but him?
Can he mark unmov’d the alter’d eye,
The voice constrain’d and cold,
Shall his bosom be denied a sigh,
When he finds his love too bold.

2. ’Tis not unkindly that her eye,
Averted from me turns
’Tis but to quench the fatal flame
That in my bosom burns;
Then ask not why my cheek is pale,
Or dim mine eyes appear;
Grudge not my broken heart one sigh,
Mine eye one bitter tear.
