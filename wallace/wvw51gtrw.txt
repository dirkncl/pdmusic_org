1. Go! Go thou restless wind. 
Once was I glad like thee. 
Fresh heart and younger mind
Are with’ring now.
The sunbeam griefs the sky.
The leaf fades on the tree.
All earthly things must die.
Glad wind even thou,
All earthly things music die.
Glad wind even thou.
Glad wind even thou.

2. Yes! Yes thou restless wind.
Rain shall cease to feed thee.
Wanderer unconfined
O’er earth and sea 
For short the hour and brief,
Though bright it be and free,
And like the beam and leaf,
Even thou must die,
And like the beam and leaf,
Even thou music die,
Even thou must die.

3. Yet! Yet thou restless wind,
I will be glad like thee
While beam and leaf I find
Still fresh and pure
And drink from earth and sky
Their green and golden glee
Until like thou and I,
They no more endure,
Until like you and I,
They no more endure,
They no more endure.
Go! Go thou restless wind.
