[SOLO (Count Magnus)]
She comes in all her loveliness of mien, 
The outlawed, fugitive, 
And trembling queen! 
Brought to my foot in danger’s darkest day 
By those who neither like nor brook her sway! 
By those who neither like nor brook her sway. 
It is not love nor passion, nor passion stirs my soul 
But high ambition, out of my control. 
She comes in all her loveliness of mien, 
The outlawed, fugitive, 
And trembling queen 
Brought to my feet in danger’s darkest day 
By those who neither like nor brook her sway; 
By those who neither like nor brook her sway. 
It is not love nor passion stirs my soul 
But high ambition out of my control 
And I must profit by her fallen state 
To share her throne, Her grandeur and her fame. 

The crown, the sceptre, and the sway 
Must all be mine, must all be mine! 
The diadem which all obey 
On me must shine, on me must shine. 
The subtle thought, the darkest plot 
Alike, alike   are vain 
And if her hand bestow it not 
By force,  by force I’ll reign! 
The crown, the scepter and the sway 
must all be mine, must all be mine. 
The diadem which all obey on me must shine, 
on me must shine. 
The diadem which all obey 
On me, on me must shine. 
The nobles are banded, and summon’d by me, 
The serfs are all soldiers, the boldest that be, 
The land of Bohemia (blighted in bloom, 
And chang’d to a battle field,) serves for their tomb, 
The people revolted, our glory persue, 
And what they effect not, ambition will do. 
Oh widow of Ladislaus, if I should dare, 
To seek with thy heart 
All thy greatness to share, 
Resist not refuse not the hand which I bring, 
For the sun of tomorrow 
Shall shine on me king! 
The crown, the scepter, and the sway 
Must all be mine, must all be mine. 
The diadem which all obey 
on me must shine, on me must shine. 
The diadem which all obey 
On me, on me must shine, on me must shine, on me must shine, 
on me must shine, on me must shine.
