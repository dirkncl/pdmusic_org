[MARITANA.]
I hear it again 'tis the harp 'tis the harp in the air
It hangs on the walls of the old moorish halls
It hangs on the walls of the old moorish halls
Tho' none know its minstrel or how it came there.
Listen Listen
There There
'Tis the harp in the air 'tis the harp 'tis the harp in the air
It telleth of days that are faded and gone
It telleth of the brave of the lovely and fair
Of warriors grave And of maiden's despair.
There there there there.
List Pilgrim list, 'tis the harp in the air.
List Pilgrim list, 'tis the harp in the air.
List Pilgrim list, 'tis the harp in the air.
List Pilgrim list, 'tis the harp in the air.
List Pilgrim list, 'tis the harp in the air.
There there there there.
