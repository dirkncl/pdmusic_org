Sing your northern prairies 
In a pretty lay. 
Of your tiny daisies 
And pale flow’rs of may! 
We have sweeter music, 
Richer airs are ours 
Breathing at the eventide 
From the orange bow’rs. 
Look! how stars of silver 
’Mid the green leaves glow, 
Look! how cressets golden 
Hang from every bough. 
Each a cap discloses 
That rare nectar pours 
What are all your roses? 
We have orange flow’rs 
What are all your roses? 
We have orange flow’rs 
La. 

In your dreary far land 
Groweth nothing fair 
Fit for triumph’s garland 
Twin’d in beauty’s hair 
Deck the maiden yearning 
By the river side 
With a wreath of mourning 
We adorn the Bride. 
Leave to northern praises 
All their chill-white may. 
And their pretty daisies 
Fit for child’s array 
We have sweeter music 
Richer airs are ours. 
What are all your roses? 
We have orange flow’rs! 
What are all your roses? 
We have orange flow’rs. 
La. 
We have orange flow’rs. 
La.
