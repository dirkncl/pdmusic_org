1. Alas, those chimes so sweetly stealing, 
Gently dulcet, gently dulcet to the ear, 
Sound like pity’s voice revealing 
To the dying, death is near. 
Still he slumbers, how serenely! 
Not a sigh disturbs his rest. 
Oh! that angels now might waft him 
To the mansions of the blest, 
  Oh! that angels now might waft him 
  To the mansions of the blest.

2. Yes, yes those chimes so softly swelling,
As from some holy sphere, as from some holy sphere,
Sound like hymns of spirits telling
To the dying, peace is here.
Come! abide with us in heaven,
Here no grief can reach thy breast;
Come! approving angels wait thee
In the mansions of the blest,
  Come! approving angels wait thee
  In the mansions of the blest.
