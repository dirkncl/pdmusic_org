1. 
In happy moments day by day,
  The sands of life may pass,
In swift but tranquil tide away,
  From time’s unering glass.
Yet hopes we used as bright to deem
  Remembrance with recall,
Whose pure and whose unfading beam,
  Is dearer than them all,
    Whose pure and whose unfading beam,
    Is dearer than them all.

2. 
The anxious eyes upon us gaze
  And hearts with fondness beat
Whose smile upon each feature plays
  With truthfulness replete
Some thoughts none other can replace
  Remembrance will recall
Which in the flight of years we trace
  Is dearer than them all,
    Which in the flight of years we trace
    Is dearer than them all,
