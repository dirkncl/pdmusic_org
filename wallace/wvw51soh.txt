1. Searcher of hearts! from mine erase
All thoughts that should not be,
And in its deep recesses trace
My gratitude to thee!
Hearer of prayer, oh guide aright
Each word, and act of mine;
Life‘s battle teach me how to fight,
And be the vict’ry thine.

2. Giver of all! for every good,
In the Redeemer came,
For shelter, raiment, and for food,
I thank thee in his name;
Father; and Son; and Holy Ghost!
Thou glorious three in one,
Thou knowest best what I need most,
And let Thy will be done.
