[MARY]
My long hair is braided
With mountain daisies gay;
My green bow'r is shaded
From ev'ry moontide ray,
From ev'ry ray.
Ah! my long hair is braided
With mountain daisies gay;
My green bow'r is shaded
From ev'ry ray.

Ah! the distant village hum,
Comes merry on the ear!

Why waitest thou to come?
The bridal hour is near.
The distant village hum,
Comes merry on the ear.
Why waitest thou to come?
Why waitest thou to come?
The bridal hour is near.
Why eaitest thou to come?
The distant village hum,
Comes merry on the ear!
Ah, come, the bridal hour is near,
Why waitest thou the bridal hour is near, the hour is near.
Ah! ah! yes, my hair is braided
With mountain daisies gay;
My green bow'r is shaded
From ev'ry moontide ray.
From ev'ry ray,
Ah! my long hair is braided
With mountain daisies gay;
My green bow'r is shaded
From ev'ry mountain ray.

Why waitest thou, why waitest thou?
Ah!
Ah! come the bridal hour is near.
The hour is near,
Ah! the hour is near,
Ah! come, the bridal hour is near.
