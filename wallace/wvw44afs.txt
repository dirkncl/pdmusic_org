1. When the children are asleep and the early stars retire, 
What a pleasant worldcomes back in the toil of day forgot; 
And the shadows of the past how they gath er round the fire, 
With the friends belov’d in years, when the fear of death was not 
With the friends belov’d in years, 
When the fear of death was not. 
Then we see the hawthorn hedge newly silver’d o’er by May 
And the ashtree lithe and tall where the mavis lov’d to sing. 
And the orchard on the slope with its rosy aples gay. 
And the elder, dark with fruit that was mirror’d in the spring. 
When the children are asleep, 
When the children are asleep.

2. And the angels of our youth that so long in earth are cold, 
They are calling us again with their voices mild and low, 
Till our minds refuse to dwell by the coffin in the mould, 
And arise with them to Heaven where in glory they are now; 
And arise with them in Heaven where in glory they are now. 
Then with thoughts of rest at eve, be so ever hard the day, 
On our spirits cometh down a contentment calm and deep; 
O better than the joys of the noisy and the gay, 
In our quiet hour of dreams when the children are asleep, 
When the children are asleep, 
When the children are asleep.
