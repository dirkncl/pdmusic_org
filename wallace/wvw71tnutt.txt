1. O sweet the dream that comes once more,
While one by one our joys go by!
On mem’ry’s fair and wondrous shore,
What lovely treasures lie!

I wait for thee where woods are green,
And sunlight falls in golden sheen
Fair boughs and leaves between
O, bright the face that meets me there,
In hope and dimpled glee!
And O the name, so dear, so fair
I carved upon the Tree,
And O the name, so dear, so fair,
I carved upon he Tree.

2. Once more I’ve wondered near the spot,
To trace thy name upon the bark!
Now here on earth I see thee not,
And life is cold and dark!

Thy name has faded from my sight,
Thy face that was my heart’s delight
Now hides in earthly night!
Yet still a joy and hope thou art,
And dear, so dear to me!
And stull is carved upon my heart,
The name upon the Tree,
Yes carved for aye upon my heart,
The name upon the Tree.
