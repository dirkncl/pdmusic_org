1.
It is the happy Summer time!
The fruits are rip'ning fast;
The glad earth cloth'd in brightest green
Forgets the snowy past.
 The fruits are rip'ning fast,
 The glad earth cloth'd in brightest green,
 Forgets the snowy past.
The quick'ning sun shines bright on all,
The flow'rs rich odours bear;
The streamlets flow thro' leafy bow'rs
And joy is ev'ry where,
 The streamlets flow thro' leafy bow'rs
 And joy is ev'ry where.

2.
It is the happy summer time!
O beating heart be still!
Bound not with such extatic joy,
With such a rapturous shrill!
 O beating heart be still!
 Bound not with such extatic joy,
 With such a rapturous shrill!
All living things seem to rejoice,
The Spirit soars on wings;
And Nature, with exultant voice,
The praise of Summer sings,
 And Nature, with exultant voice,
 The praise of Summer sings!
