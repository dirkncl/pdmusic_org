1.
O'er her features, lightly playing,
Smiles like gleams of light appear,
Angels whisper near her saying
"Bright shall be each future year!" each future year!
Sweet must be each rosy slumber,
Blissful themes her mind employ,
May her thoughts outnumber
All that crown her dream of joy! her dream of joy!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Slumber still belov'd and dear one,
Dream of bliss without alloy,
Sweet it is to watch thee, to watch thee, near me,
Break not yet, sweet dream of joy! sweet dream of joy!
Break not yet, sweet dream of joy!
Break not yet, sweet dream of joy!

2.
Let no sound of mirth awake her,
Whisper near her faint and low,
No kind words of ours can make her
Feel the bliss she now must know, she now must know!
Free'd from scenes of earthly sorrow,
May the future ne'er destroy,
Those bright hopes she seems to borrow
From her transient dreams of joy! her dreams of joy!
