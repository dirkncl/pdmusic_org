1.
I will not yield my freedom, no!
Unfetter'd still in heart I rove;
I laugh and sing where e'er I go,
And scorn the tyrant love,
And scorn the tyrant love.
For love thy subtle pow'r,
Brings sorrow as its dow'r,
I'll ever sing young hearts be gay,
Youth is life's time of May.
 I'll ever sing young hearts be gay,
 Youth is life's time of May.

2.
Thus sung a maiden bright and fair,
In pride of beauty's richest dow'r;
She laughe'd-- the tyrant lurking near,
Smiled in his conscious pow'r
Maiden beware I pray!
Love's spell is o'er thy way!
Love's spell is o'er thy way!
No more you'll say young hearts be gay
 Youth is life's time of May--
 Youth is life's time of May.

3.
Love came at length-- the free heart fell,
From its proud and scornful state,
But where and how, I shall not tell,
She lov'd-- it was her fate
She lov'd-- it was her fate,
Without or guile or art,
She yielded up her heart
And now will say, young hearts be gay,
Love is life's time of May.
 And now will say, young hearts be gay,
 Love is life's time of May.
