(Maritana)
1.
Scenes that are brightest
May charm awhile
Hearts which are lighted,
And eyes that smile;
Yet o'er them, above us,
Tho' nature beam,
With none to love us,
How sad they seem
With none to love us,
How sad they seem!

2.
Words cannot scater
The thoughts we fear
For tho' they flatter,
They mock the ear.
Hopes will still deceive us
With tearful cost
And when they leave us
The heart is lost
And when they leave us
The heart is lost.
