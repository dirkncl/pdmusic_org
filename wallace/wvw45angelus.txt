Angels that around us hover, 
Guard us till the close of day! 
Angels that around us hover, 
Guard us till the close of day! 
Our heads, oh, let your white wings cover! 
See us kneel, and hear us pray; 
See us kneel and hear us pray; 
Angels that around us hover, 
Guard us till the close of day! 
Our heads, oh, let your white wings cover! 
See us kneel and hear us pray; 
See us kneel, and hear us pray, hear us pray, hear us pray; 
See us kneel, and hear us pray, and hear us pray.
