[Matilda]
One gentle heart which we believe, 
With us to smile, with us to grieve, 
While worldly state round us may pall 
Wieldeth a charm dearer than all! 
With us to smile, with us to grieve, 
One gentle heart which we believe, we believe 
While worldly state round us may pall 
Wieldeth a charm dearer than all, 
wieldeth a charm ah! dearer than all! 

CHORUS [SSTTB]
Happy and peaceful be 
Those in their love thus free 
Whom we united see o’er us to reign,
o’er us to reign, o’er us to reign.

Ah! 
One gentle heart which we believe,
With us to smile, with us to grieve,
While worldly state round us may pall,
Wieldeth a charm dearer than all!
With us to smile, with us to grieve,
One gentel heart which we beleve, we believe
While worldly state round us may pall,
Wieldeth a charm dearer than all, 
wieldeth a charm ah! dearer than all! 

[Overlapping voices]
[Matilda]
dearer than all, dearer than all, than all, than all. 
[CHORUS] 
Happy and peaceful be 
those in their love thus free 
whom we united see o’er us to reign.
