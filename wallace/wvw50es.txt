Oh! I am Echo, Queen of sound,
’Mid rocks and caves I roam,
Unseen I float the wide world round 
Or make the Sea my home.
Oh I am Echo, Queen of sound,
’Mid rocks and caves I roam,
Unseen I float the wide world round
Or make the Sea my home.
Upon the distant shore I sleep
Till waked by Magic song
Then climbing up the mountain steep,
I bear the notes along,
Then climbing up the mountain steep,
I bear the notes along.

I hide me in the leafy glade 
And rule the trembling Air,
The winds in whispers woo the shade,
While I repeat them there,
While I repeat, while I repeat them there,
While I repeat, repeat them there.
When darkness cloathes the lovely Lake
And gently flows the Wave
Upon its brow my bed I make,
And answer ev’ry lave,
And answer ev’ry Lave.

Oh I am Echo, Queen of Sound,
’Mid rocks and caves I roam
Unseen I float the wide World round,
Or make the Sea my home.
Oh I am Echo, Queen of Sound,
’Mid rocks and caves I roam
Unseen, I float the wide Worlds round,
Or make the sea my home.

But in yon Heav’n I rest my wing,
Tho’ music fill the skies
No sounds from thence to Earth I bring,
I love alone to rise,
No sounds from thence to Earth I bring
I love alone to rise.
