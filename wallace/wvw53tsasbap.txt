1. The Spring and Summer both are past,
And all their pleasures flown;
The Autumn’s golden tinted leaves,
Upon the earth are strown.
The bending corn is gather’d in,
The fruit is all in store;
All barren now the meadows gay,
That we have wander’d o’er!
The Winter cometh now,
The Winter cometh now,
With storms around his brow,
And bitter Northern blast;
Ah! weep for Pleasures gone,
All perish’d ev’ry one,
Ah! weep for pleasures gone,
Too bright, too bright to last.
Ah! weep for pleasures gone,
too bright, too bright to last.

2. The fleecy snow is falling fast,
Upon the frozen ground;
The rivers erst so glancing bright,
In icy chains are bound.
The Winter moon looks coldly down,
Upon the earth so drear;
The howling wind, in boding tones
Proclaims the dying year!
The spring so fresh and warm,
Has all Youth’s joyous charm;
The Summer is life’ Prime;—
Like Autumn, ripen’d Age;
Then comes the closing Page,
The solemn Winter time!
Them comes life’s closing Page,
The solemn Winter time!
Then comes life’s closing Page,
The solemn Winter time!
The Winter time!
