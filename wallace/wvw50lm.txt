1. Love’s own gentle minstrel
When the dew is falling,
Twilights sunbeam’s slanting,
O’er the western tow’r
’Neath the spreading linden tree,
At the moonlight hour,
Come and sing once more to me,
Gentle Troubadour,
Love’s own gentle minstrel
When the dew is falling,
Twilights sunbeam’s slanting,
O’er the western tow’r
’Neath the linden tree,
At the moonlight hour,
Come and sing once more to me.
Gentle Troubadour.
Come and sing to me,
Gentle Troubadour.

2. Loves own gentle minstrel
When love’s bird is sailing
Balm the zephyrs scenting
From each fragrant flow’r
’Neath my rose hung lattice be
At the silent hour
Bring thy lute and sing to me,
Gentle Troubadour,
Love’s own Gentle Minstrel,
When love’s bird is calling
Balm the zephyrs scenting
From each fragrant flow’r
’Neath my lattice be
At the silent hour
Bring thy lute and sing to me,
Gentle Troubadour.
Come and sing to me
Gentle Troubadour.
