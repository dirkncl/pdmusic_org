1.
I cannot sleep as once I slept
More calm than yonder moon above me,
I cannot weep as once I wept
For joy that any deigned to love me;
For now I wake in chains along
From dreams that make my pulses quiver
And sadly own though hope be gone
That mem'ry lives alas! for ever;
And sadly own though hope be gone,
That mem'ry lives Alas! for ever;
That mem'ry lives
That mem'ry lives Alas! for ever.

2.
I see his joyous shadow pass
In ev'ry cloud the forest shading
In ev'ry breeze that stirs the grass
I listen to his Serenading.
O that the sense of Ear and Eye
Were drowned in Lethe's balmy river,
For Love may wane and joy pass by,
But mem'ry lives Alas! for ever,
For Love may wane and joy pass by,
But mem'ry lives Alas! for ever;
But mem'ry lives
But mem'ry lives Alas! for ever.
