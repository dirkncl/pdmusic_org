1. I love and I am happy,
As light as heart can be,
The griefs which sadden others,
Have but their spell on me.
I love and I am happy,
As light as hearts can be,
The griefs which sadden others,
Have lost their spell on me.
It is not rank nor treasure,
Which bring too often pain,
[REFRAIN]
It is to know how fondly
I am belov’d again,
It is to know how fondly
I am belov’d again!

2. To have no thoughts divided,
No hope that is not shared,
No wish before ’tis whisper’d,
Unthought of or uncared.
To have no thoughts divided,
No hope that is not shared,
No wish before ’tis whisper’d,
Unthought of or uncared.
To mingle all our sorrows,
If such the heart should stain,
[REFRAIN]
Speak more than words how fondly
I am belov’d again,
It is to know how fondly
I am belov’d again!
