1.
When the solemn Convent bell
Pealeth forth the Vesper hour;
Then quit we our dreary cell
Heedless ofthe wint'ry show'r!
Ours, near Sorrow's couch to pray,
Strewing flowers o'er the way,
The stormy way which leads on high,
 The stormy way which leads on high.

Then pray all,
With the Sisters of Mercy,
They prall all,
With the Sisters of Mercy,
pray all,
With the Sisters of Mercy,
Let our voices swell to verper's call,
 Our voices swell to verper's call.

2.
Near the battlefield we stand,
When the war-cries rend the air,
With tearful eye and gentle hand,
Aiding those who perish there;
Ours, to close the dying eyes,
To watch from earth, the souls retreat!
And 'mid solemn tears and sighs,
(Thus) We waft it ot its Maker's feet,
We waft, we waft it to its Maker's feet.

Then pray all
With the Sisters of Mercy,
Then pray all,
With the Sisters of Mercy,
pray all,
With the Sisters of Mercy,
Let our voices swell to verper's call,
Our voices swell to verper's call,
Pray all,
Pray all,
Pray all.
