1.
A lowly youth, the mountain child,
Within his heart a love conceal'd,
Whose depth, with accents sweet and wind,
To echo only he reveal'd
Ah if you knew, he would repeat,
How fair she is, how true, how fond
But echo! faithful and discreet,
The name he breath'd would not respond,
 but echo faithful and discreet
 the name he breath'd would not repeat.

2.
His secret having thus possess'd
She priz'd so much its charmed tone
That echo, strange to say, confess'd
Instead of his deep love her own.
That voice so tender and so sweet
Was her's who worship'd at his shrine
And which would day and night repeat
My heart is fond and true as thine
 And which would day and night repeat
 My heart is fond and trus as thine.
