1.
Beside a flowing river
I heard a sad sweet song,
From lips which seem'd to quiver
With passion deep and strong;
And still I paus'd to listen--
The burden changing ever:
"My life is wearing sad away
Dreaming of _thee_ for ever,
"My life is wearing sad away
Dreaming of _thee_ for ever,
Dreaming of _thee_ for ever!"

2.
I saw the branches sunder
And part the foliage deep,
Just where the maid sat under
Who stay'd her song to weep.
And soon a fond voice whisper'd:
"Sweet May, we'll no more sever!
Our lives shall pass in joy away
Dreaming of _Love_ for ever,
Thy life shall pass in joy away
Dreaming of _Love_ for ever,
Dreaming of _Love_ for ever."
