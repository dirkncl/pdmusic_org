1. 
There is a flower that bloometh,
When Autumn leaves are shed,
With the silent morn it peepeth,
The spring and summer fled,
The early frosts of winter,
Scarce its brow hath overcast,
Oh! pluck it e’er it wither,
’Tis the mem’ry of the past.
  Oh! pluck it e’er it wither,
  ’Tis the mem’ry, the mem’ry of the past.

2. 
It wafteth perfume o’er us,
Which few can e’er forget,
Of the bright scenes gone before us,
Of sweet tho’ sad regret,
Let no heart brave its power,
By guilty thoughts o’ercast,
For then a poison’d flower,
’Tis the mem’ry of the past.
  For then a poison’d flower,
  ’Tis the mem’ry, the mem’ry of the past.
