1.
Happy birdling of the forest
Ever singing as thou soarest
Who hath taught thee little minion
Bird upon thy golden pinion.
Thus to warble wild and high
Half to earth and half to sky ... half to sky
Tra la la la ...
tra la la
tra la la

2.
Happy birdling from from sorrow
Never dreaming of the morrow
Hast thou ever notes of sadness
Or dost always sing for gladness
Tell me birdling is thy strain
But a gladsome life refrain
  Tell me birdling is thy strain
  But a gleesome life refrain
Tra la
la la la
tra la
la la la
la la
la

3.
Happy birdling gaily fleeting
Evermore thy song repeating
I would learn thy lesson surely
Could I only learn it purely
Learn to warble wild and high
Half to earth and half to sky half to sky
Tra
la

4.
Happy birdling of the forest
Who hath taught thee thus to warble
Wild and high
Happy birdling
Ah!
Who hath taught thee
Thus to warble wild and high,
Half to earth, half to sky,
half to earth, half to sky.
