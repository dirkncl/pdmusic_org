1.
The leaves are turning red,
The green has pass'd away;
The balmy air
Breathes perfume rare,
From mounds of new mown hay.

The leaves are turning red,
The balmy air
Breathes perfume rare,
From mounds of new mown hay.

Fair children sport the hay among,
Like fairy sprites at play,
They laugh and sing a joyous song,
Amid the fragrant hay!
 They laugh and sing a joyous song,
 Amid the fragrant hay!

2.
The corn is rip'ning fast,
And bendeth to the ground;
The peach and pear,
And melon rare,
And gen'rous grape abound!

The corn is rip'ning fast,
And bendeth to the ground;
The peach and pear,
And melon rare,
And gen'rous grape abound!

No more the summer's fervent heat,
O'ertakes us on our way;
We roam at will with tireless feet,
Thro'out the livelong day!
 We roam at will with tireless feet,
 Thro'out the livelong day!

[REFRAIN]
O fair as Autumn Golden Autumn!
Nature paints thy richest dyes,
Tints that shame a southern sunset,
Shed a glow o'er earth and skies,
 Shed a glow o'er earth and skies!

3.
The leaves are falling fast,
And o'er the earth are strown;
A chilling breeze
Sweeps tho' the trees,
With sad and fitful moan.

The leaves are falling fast,
And o'er the earth are strown;
A chilling breeze
Sweeps tho' the trees,
With sad and fitful moan.

We read in this life's omen sad,
Of coming winter's thrall;
We've pass'd our spring and summer glad,
We're rip'ning to the fall!
 We've pass'd our spring and summer glad,
 We're rip'ning to the fall!


[REFRAIN]
Still fair Autumn! Golden Autumn!
Nature paints thy richest dyes;
Tints that shame a southern sunset
Shed a glow o'er earth and skies,
 Shed a glow o'er earth and skie.
