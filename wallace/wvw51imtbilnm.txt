1.
I love'd thee once with heart as true
As ever fond affection knew,
Each joy, each care but seem'd to twine,
In closer bonds thy soul and mine;
But fortune's smile has found thee chang'd:
Thy friendship cool'd, thy love estrang'd;
'Tis done, the dream of years o'er,
I mourn thee,-- but I love no more.

2.
Seek not to meet me! 'twere but vain
To give to each a fruitless pain;
The feeble smile, the careless eye,
would but the wounded heart belie,
Farewell-- tho' sorrow thou might feel,
Oh! from thy heart all hope conceal,
No light can now the past restore,
I mourn thee,-- but I love no more.
