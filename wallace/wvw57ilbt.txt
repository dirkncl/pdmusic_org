1. When this sad heart was faint and weary,
Like some lone pilgrim on desert plain!
When all around seem’d dark and dreary,
And ev’ry friendship was rent in twain;
Thou, like some fount did’st spring to cheer me,
Around life’s pathway a radiance shed—
I felt a hope when thou wert near me,
And pray’d for blessings upon thy head;
Each pulse that long had coldly slumber’d
When thou wert smiling, renew’d in me,
Ah, yes! I felt I could be happy
If but remember’d,
If lov’d by thee,
If but remember’d,
If lov’d by thee,

2. The wand’ring bird o’er billows winging
To find a shelter in some warm nest;
Feels not more joy within it springing
Than I, to welcome some ark of rest,—
To share the love ’ere life be closing
Of one fond bosom as pure as thine,
To feel that hand in this reposing:—
May such a blessing at last be mine,
While those dear eyes now mildly beaming
Like stars of promise, shine down on me.
Oh, yes! I feel I can be happy
If but remember’d,
If lov’d by thee,
If but remember’d,
If lov’d by thee,
