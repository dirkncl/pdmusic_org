1.
They who would still be happy, must
But little in the future trust,
Tho' clouds nor gale the sky deform,
A moment after breaks the storm
And thunders roll, and lightnings play,
O'er what before was brightest day
And wreck'd has bark been on the strand
with many banners near at hand
Tho' clouds nor gale the sky deform
A moment after breaks the storm
And thunders roll and lightnings play
O'er what before was brigtest day.

And wreck'd has bark been on the strand
With many havens near at hand.

2.
Yon rose, of unalloy'd perfume
An inward canker may consume
Its verdure morning's fresh'ning dew
May waken into life anew,
And balmy sigh of eve may close
Its leaves into a false repose,
But long ere summer wing its flight
That rose will droop beneath its blight
And balmy sigh of eve may close
its leaves into a false repose;
But long ere summer wing its flight
That rose will droop beneath its blight

But long ere summer wing its flight
That rose will droop beneath its blight.
