1.
Wake not the sleeper, weary with her sorrow,
Hush! let the weeper dream of joy tomorrow,
Only in sleep, from which too soon she'll waken
Ceases to weep the lone one, hope forsaken.

Sweet be the rest, her weary eyelids closing,
Calm is her breast, like life in death reposing;

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Wake not the sleeper, weary with her sorrow,
Ah! let the weeper dream of joy tomorrow!
Wake not the sleeper, weary with her sorrow,
Ah! let the weeper dream of joy tomorrow!
Ah! let the weeper dream of joy,
let the weeper dream of joy tomorrow.

2.
Lift not the veil that hides her hidden sorrow,
Ask not her tale, for all there is a morrow,
Why 'twas she grieved, if innocent or erring,
Wrong'd or deceiv'd, no pang her heart is stirring.

Deem but if sleep from anguish can relieve her,
Fond hearts may yearn to succour and receive her,
