1.
Gone is the calmness
Far from my heart
Which could such feelings of joy impart
Not all the splendor
Rank can attain
Ever can render
Its peace again.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Gone is the calmness
Far from my heart
Which could such feelings of joy impart
Which could such feelings of joy impart.

2.
Hope may with plumage
Bright on its wing,
Flutter a moment;
Uncertain thing.
Painting a prospect never to be;
Showing a future we ne'er shall see.
