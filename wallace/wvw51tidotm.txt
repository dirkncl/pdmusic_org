1.
There is darkness on the mountain,
There is darkness on the mountain,
But the stars between the breaking clouds
Are hanging like a chain.
A chain of golden glitt'ring gems,
Let down into the sea,
To chain the bonny moon up,
To light my love to me.
 To chain the bonny moon up,
 To light my love to me.

2.
He is tosson on the billows,
Whose sullen boom below,
To other ears would seem to tell
Of danger and of woe;
But I can smile that sound to hear,
For safe I feel is he
Who braves the stormy ocean,
Tonight, for love and me!
 Who braves the stormy ocean,
 Tonight, for love and me!

3.
Up, the moon in splendor rises
Ev'ry cloud to silver turns,
And the sea is but a sheet of glass,
In which her image burns,
O! night that still thy blackest pall,
Hung main and mountain o'er,
For a wreck is on the waters
And a curse in on the shore,
 For a wreck is on the waters
 And a curse in on the shore,
