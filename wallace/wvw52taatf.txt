1.
A few may be found in this planet of ours,
Who like the fair spirits that revel in flow'rs,
And empty their cups of the dew,
And empty their cups of the dew,
Those forms so enchanting and tresses so bright,
And eyes of such wild unearthly light,
They are almost too lovely for mortal sight,
And thou art among the few!
Thou art among the few!
Thou art among the few!
They are almost too lovely for mortal sight,
And thou art among the few!

2.
O some may win fortune and some may win fame,
And all must feel sorrow and many know shame,
As they wander life's pilgrimage through,
As they wander life's pilgrimage through,
Come the joy or grief in my pathway that lies!
Even shame I could bear if the few that I prize,
Would look on me still with the same fond eyes,
For thou art among the few! 
thou art among the few!
thou art among the few!
Would look on me still with the same fond eyes,
For thou art among the few!

3.
Then blessings be on thee! wherever my lot
May lead me, believe,
Thou wilt never ne'er be forgot,
till forgotten all else shall be too!
Till forgotten all else shall be too!
And when counting the stars that have spangled the night,
Of my cares with their cheering and beautiful light,
My heart will record thee, thou dear little sprite,
The brightest among the few!
Brightest among the few!
Brightest among the few!
My heart will record thee thou dear little sprite,
The brightest among the few!
