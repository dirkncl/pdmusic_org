1. O! Thou Omnipotent!
Thus we adore Thee!
Now with knee lowly bent,
We bow before Thee.
O! Thou Omnipotent!
Thus we adore Thee!
Now with knee lowly bent,
We bow before Thee.
Humble but Trusting hearts,
Leaning on Thee alone;
Praying when life departs,
Grace! Grace from Thy Holy throne!
Thy Holy throne!
O! Lord Omnipotent! 
O! Holy One!

2. O! Thou Omnipotent!
Patience ’midst Sorrow
By Thee is kindly sent,
Hope comes with morrow.
O! Thou Omnipotent!
Patience ’midst Sorrow
By Thee is kindly snet,
Hope comes with morrow;
Placing our Faith in Thee,
Leaning on Thee alone,
Ever our pray’r shall be—
Grace! Grace from Thy Holy throne,
Thy Holy throne!
O! Lord Omnipotent!
O! Holy One!
