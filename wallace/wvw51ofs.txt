1. While on my home once more I gaze,
From this, how well remember’d sleep;
And dream the dream of early days:
Come mem’ry with me weep!

While on my home once more I gaze,
And dream the dream of early days,
Come mem’ry with me weep!
How chang’d am I, yet, how unchang’d
Appears this tranquil view;
The meads, the grooves, so often rang’d,
Still smiling thro’ the dew.
  The meads, the groves, so often rang’d,
  Still smiling thro’ the dew.

2. Still there, the cotters early fire
Wreathing, serese its column white;
Still there, the old church dawnlit spire,
The wand’rer’s beacon light.

Still there, the Cotters early fire
Still there, the old church dawnlit spire;
The wand’rer’s beacon light.
And thus when grief and adverse years,
Have nothing but a name,
Old  Friendship’s smile altho’ in tears,
Will welcome us the same.
  Old  Friendship’s smile altho’ in tears,
  Will welcome us the same.
