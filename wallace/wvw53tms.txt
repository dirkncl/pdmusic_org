1.
When wand'ring from my home afar,
The mem'ry of my Mother's Smile
Still beams, as 'twere a guiding star,
To cheer my heart each lonely mile.
Again I hear accents low,
Her hand seems clasping mine the while;
I feel her kiss upon my brow,
And meet again my Mother's Smile,
 I feel her kiss upon my brow,
 And meet again my Mother's Smile,

2.
Oh, other smiles may charm me yet,
And other hearts for me beat true;
But never can my soul forget
The first pure love my childhood knew.
And still on life's lone path of care,
In hours of joy, 'mid pleasure's wile,
Be this to heav'n my daily pray'r--
O, keep unchang'd my Mother's Smile,
 Be this to heav'n my daily pray'r--
 O, keep unchang'd my Mother's Smile.
