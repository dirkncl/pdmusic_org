1. In that devotion which we breathe
And struggle to disguise,
Tho’ bright the surface, underneath
A deeper passion lies,
The charm his words and acts reveal,
Soars all belief above,

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
And I, for gratitude must feel
What others feel for love
And I for gratitude must feel
What others feel for love.

2. The soul with such devotion warm,
May thus aspire unbid—
To prove that in an Angel’s form
A demon’s heart is hid:—
But still the charm his words reveal
Soars all belief above
