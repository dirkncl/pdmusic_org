1.
Yes! let me like a Soldier fall,
Upon some open plain,
This breast expanding for the ball
To blot out ev'ry stain.
Brave manly hearts confer my doom
That gentler one may tell
Howe'er forgot, unknown my tomb,
I like a Soldier fell,
Howe'er forgot, unknown my tomb,
I like a Soldier fell.
I like a Soldier fell.

2.
I only ask of that proud race,
Which ends its blaze in me,
To die the last, and not disgrace
Its ancient chivalry!
Tho' o'er my clay no banner wave,
Nor trumpet reguiem swell,
Enough they murmur o'er my grave
He like a Soldier fell,
Enough they murmur o'er my grave
He like a Soldier fell,
He like a Soldier fell.
