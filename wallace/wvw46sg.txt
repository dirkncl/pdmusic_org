1.
Speak gently! it is better far
 To rule by love than fear.
Speak gently! let not harsh words mar
 The good we might do here.

2.
Speak gently! love doth whisper low
 The vows that true hearts bind;
And gently friendship's accents flow--
 Affections's voice is kind.

3.
Speak gently to the little child,
 Its love be sure to gain;
Teach it in accents soft and mild--
 It may not long remain.

4.
Speak gently to the young, for they
 Will have enough to bear;
Pass through this life as best they may,
 'Tis full of anxious care.

5.
Speak gently to the aged one,
 Grieve not the careworn heart;
The sands of life are nearly run--
 Let such in peace depart.

6.
Speak gently-- kindly to the poor,
 Let no harsh tone be heard;
They have enough thy must endure
 Without an unkind word.

7.
Speak gently to the erring-- know
 They may have foiled in vain;
Perhaps unkindness made them so,
 Oh win them back again.

8.
Speak gently!-- He who gave his life
 To bend man's stubborn will,
When elements were in fierce strife,
 Said to them, "Peace be still!"

9.
Speak gently!-- 'tis a little thing
 Dropped in the heart's deep well;
The good, the joy which it may bring,
 Eternity shall tell.
