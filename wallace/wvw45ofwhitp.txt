_(Enter Martiana and Don Juan, the Peasants having 
now dispersed.)_

NARRATOR.  Don Juan, half attracted and half jealous 
of Maritana’s charms, nevertheless flatters her natural 
ambition by praising her beauty and clevernes, and they 
sing together the duet “Of Fairy wand had I the Power,”
after which a crowd of pessantry etc. rally round 
Maritana whom they adore, begging her to read their fates.

_(curtain rises.)_

[SOLO, Maritano]
Of Fairy wand had I command, 
Of Fairy wand had I command. 
At moonlit hour in silken bower, 
To music’s note on air I’d float, 
To music’s note on air I’d float. 
In golden sheen and jewels gay 
Of pleasures Queen, I’d laugh and sing. 
In golden shade and jeweles gay, 
Of pleasure Queen I’d laugh and sing. 
Of pleasure Queen I’d dance and play. 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d laugh and sing. 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d laugh and sing. 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d laugh and sing. 

[SOLO, Don Juan]
Those sparkling eyes are brighter prize 
That gems that glow on king ly brow; 
Of those avail ere yet their fate, 
For joy will quail when time o’ershade 
Then laugh while love and beauty aid! 
Those sparkling eyes are brighter prize 
Than gems that glow on kingly brow; 
Of those avail ere yet they fade, 
For joy will quail when time o’ershade, 
Then laugh while love and beauty aid. 
Then laugh while love and beauty aid. 
Then laugh while love and beauty aid. 
Then laugh while love, while love and beauty aid. 

[DUET, with overlapping voices]
[Maritana]
Ah! of golden sheen and jewel gay, 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d laugh and sing. 
In golden sheen and jewels gay. 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d laugh and sing, 
Of pleasure Queen, I’d dance and play. 
[Don Juan]
Those sparkling eyes are brighter prize 
Than gems that glow on kingly brow; 
Of those avail ere yet they fade, 
For joy will quail when time o’ershade, 
Then laugh while love and beauty aid.
