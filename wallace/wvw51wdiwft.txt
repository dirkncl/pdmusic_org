1.
Why do I weep for thee?
Why weep, in my sad dreams?
Parted, for aye are we,
Yes! parted like mountain streams.
Yet, with me, lingers still
That word, that one last word,
Thy voice, thy voice, yet seems to thrill
The heart's fond chord.
Why do I weep for thee?
Why do I weep for thee?

2.
Once, oh! what joy to share
With thee the noontide hour;
Then, not a grief nor care
Had canker's the heart's young flow'r.
The sun seems not to shed
A radiance o'er me now,
Save mem'ry all seems dead,
Since lost, since lost art thou.
Why do I weep for thee?
Why do I weep for thee?
