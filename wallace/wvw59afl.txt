1. The nectar cup may yield delight,
The heart sweet music move;
But oh! no charm, however bright,
Is like paternal love.
Affection wears a silken chain—
O’er deserts tho’ we’ve rove,
It gently draws us back again,
Each link a father’s love.
It gentle draws us back again,
Each link a father’s love; a father’s love,
Each link a father’s love.

2. Yes! like the balm of op’ning flow’rs,
Across the ocean foam,
It floats with us to distant shores;
It pilots back our home,
Alas! how oft, in later years,
Tho’ chang’d the heart may prove,
Doth mem’ry’s dream recall, thro’ tears,
A father’s early love.
Doth mem’ry’s dream recall, thro’ tears,
A father’s early love; a father’s love,
A father’s early love.
