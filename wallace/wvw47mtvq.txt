1. Mary! pretty Mary! 
come and dance with me 
’neath the shady tree, 
Like a fairy, gentle Mary, 
Or a woodnymph fair to see. 
Sister spirits thee attending, 
Seem we village maids to be 
as our sportive forms are bending 
In the mazy dance with thee. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Mary! pretty Mary! 
come and dance with me 
’neath the shady tree, 
Like a fairy gentle Mary, 
Or a woodnymph fair to see!

2. Mary! happy Mary, 
on the village green 
for our Mayday Queen, 
We have found thee, 
and have crowned thee 
as the fairrest of the scene! 
Take the wreath, ’tis thine to wear it, 
reign, ’tis but a little day. 
In our hearts with thee we share it, 
Mary, smiling Queen of May.
