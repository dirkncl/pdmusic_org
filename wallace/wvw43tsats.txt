1.
The sword of the hero!
The staff of the sage
Whose valor and wisdom
Are stamp'd on the age.
Time hallow'd mementos
Of those who have riven
The sceptre from the tyrants,
The lightning from heaven!
The sceptre from tyrants,
The lightning from heaven!

2.
This weapon, oh Freedom!
Was drawn by the sun,
And it never was sheath'd
'Till the battle was won!
No stain of dishonour
Upon it we see!
'Twas never surrender'd
Except to the free!
'Twas never surrender'd
Except to the free!

3.
While Fame claims the hero
And patriot sage,
Their names to emblazon
On history's page,
No holier relics
Will Liberty hoard,
Than Franklin's staff guarded
By Washington's sword.
Than Franklin's staff guarded
By Washington's sword.

QUARTET
The sword of the hero!
The staff of the sage!
Whose valor and wisdom
Are stamp'd on the age;
Time hallow'd mememtos
Of those who have riven
The sceptre from tyrants,
The lightning from heaven!
The sceptre from tyrants,
The lightning from heaven!
