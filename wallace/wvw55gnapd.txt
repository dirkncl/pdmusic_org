1.
When on its couch of rosy clouds
The burning sun has sunk to rest
And tired of song, the woodland bird
Is sleeping in its quiet nest,
When evening lays its misty hand
On dewy flow'rs and prattling streams,
How sweet to hear from lips we love:
Good night! good night and pleasant dreams!

2.
O, bitter is the exile's fate
Who wanders from his peaceful cot,
No gentle wish, or soothing word
Can mingle in his lonely lot.
On some still bank of moss and flow'rs,
Beneath the star's inconstant beams,
He rests alone, with none to breathe:
Good night! Good night and pleasant dreams!
