1. Bird of the wild wing, 
Bird of the foam, 
Arab of aether! 
Fly to my home. 
Tall grow its cedars, 
Far o’er the sea, 
Fair wave their branches, 
Oh, bird, for thee! 
Bird of the wild wing, 
Bird of the foam, 
Arab of aether! 
Oh, fly to my home! 
Arab of aether! 
Oh, fly to my home! 

2. Bird of the wildwing, 
Bird of the foam, 
Stay not, I pray thee, 
Long near my home! 
Words of affection, 
Tarry to hear, 
Bring down the message, 
Bear me the tear. 
Bird of the wild wing, 
Bird of the foam, 
Stay not, I pray thee, 
Long near my home! 
Stay not, I pray thee, 
Long near me home!
