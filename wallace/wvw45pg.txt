[CHORUS of Peasantry]
Pretty Gitana, tell us, tell us what the fates, the fate decree! 
Pretty Gitana, tell us, tell us shall we, 
shall we, shall we 
shall I (we) happy be? 
Pretty Gitana, shall I (we) happy be?
Pretty Gitana, shall I married be? 
Pretty Gitana, tell us, tell us  what the fates, the fates decree. 
Pretty Gitana, tell us, tell us shall we, shall we, shall we happy be? 

{MARITANA (soprano)]
Yes, yes, the language of the skies 
With ease can I, can I impart; 
But plainer read in starry eyes, 
The language of the heart. 
With whom begins the charm? 

[CHORUS]
With me, with me, with me! with me! 

[MARITANA]
Young soldier, first your pain let me see. 
[SOLDIER]
Willingly,
[MARITANA]
You love 
[SOLDIER (bass]
willingly.

[MARITANA]
a pretty dame, a pretty dame. 

[SOLDIER]
that's true!

[MARITANA]
You are to blame, you are to blame, 
Beware of wooing too young a wife, too young a wife. 
Her youth and beauty will cause you strife, will cause you strife. 

[CHORUS]
Beware of wooing too young a wife, too young a wife. 
Her youth and beauty will cause you strife, will cause you strife.
