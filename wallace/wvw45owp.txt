Oh! what pleasure, the soft guitar, 
Oh! what pleasure, the soft, the soft guitar, 
And merry castanet, and merry castanet. 
Beguile, beguile the hours, 
while balmy flowers, 
while balmy flowers, 
And sparkling wine, with eyes that shine, that shine. 
Beguile, beguile the hours, 
while balmy flowers, while balmy flowers, 
and sparkling wine, with eyes that shine, 
with eyes that shine 
Like wand’ring stars together met, 
Chase from the heart, 
Chase from the heart all sad regret, all sad regret, 

Let true delight each bosom cheer, 
Since not a care can enter here, can enter here, 
Let true delight each bosom cheer, 
Since not a care can enter here, can enter here, 
can enter here, can enter here, 
can enter here, can enter here!
