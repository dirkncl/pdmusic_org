1. I set the bell aringing,
When the bride to the altar was led,
And I loved to hear it swinging
So merrily over my head;
The childred flung gay garlands round,
While I sent forth the jocund sound,
Then many tears were shed, but yet,
The young lip smil’d while the cheek was wet.
Ah! me, ah! me, ah! me a song of joy and hope
Was heard afar as I pull’d my rope,
as I pull’d my rope.

2. I set the bell atolling,
When the bride to the churchyard was bourne,
And the dismal notes went rolling,
To tell of a heart forlorn;
The wond’ring children stood aghast,
As sable mourners by them pass’d;
“And she is gone, so fair, so young,”
Thus loud lamented the iron tongue.
Ah me, ah! me, ah! me a song of perish’d hope
Was heard afar as I pull’d my rope,
as I pull’d my rope.

3. I set the bell apealing,
When in shadow is buried the day,
And a wond’rous spell is stealing,
O’er the hearts of the grave and gay;
The aged hear the fun’ral chime
Of slowly, surely dying time;
The youthful hear a cheering strain,
That tells them day will revive again.
Ah! me, ah! me, ah me, 
a song of grief and hope is heard afar,
as I pull my rope,
A song of grief and hope
Is heard afar, as I pull my rope.
