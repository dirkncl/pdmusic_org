1. The Maid was fair, the Knight was brave,
The Bridal vow has past;
When hark a loud and shrilly note,
It ’tis the Trumpet blast
One parting word, one last embrace,
No recreant Knight is He,
Her tear is answer’d by a smile,
That speaks of Victory.

2. The Battle’s o’er, the day is won,
Each Knight but he returns,
Her staining eye with anxious gaze,
And mad impatience burn,—
At last there comes a mounful band,
There comes a Knightly beir,
A War Horse led by weeping Page,
With shield and broken spear.

3. The yellow scarf that cross’d his breast
Now hears a dismal stain,—
She sees it all,— the tale is told—
Her own true Knight is slain;—
No shriek of horror is then heard!
No word of grief is spoke!
Her lip is pale,— he eye is fix’d—
The Maiden’s heart is broke!
