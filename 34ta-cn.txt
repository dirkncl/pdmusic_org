[QUARTET: Treble, Countertenor, Tenor, Bass]
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
And in to his courts with praise. 
For the Lord is good, 
his mercy is everlasting 
and his truth 
endureth to all generation. 

[SOLO for Treble]
I will sing unto the Lord 
as long as I live, 
I will sing praise to my God, 
while I have my being, 
I will sing praise, 
sing praise to my God 
while I have my being.

[DUETT for Treble and Tenor] 
[TENOR]
He mendeth the springs into the valleys, 
which run among the hills. 
[TREBLE and TENOR]
He mendeth the springs 
into the valleys 
which run among the hills 
which run 
among the hills. 
[TREBLE]
He causeth the grass 
to grow for catle, 
and harb for the service of man. 
[TREBLE and TENOR]
He causeth the grass 
to grow for cattle 
and harb for the service of man, 
that he may bring food 
out of the earth. 

[SOLO: Bass]
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness,
and thy paths, thy paths, drop fatness
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness
and the little hills rejoice on ev'ry side,
and the little hills rejoice on ev'ry side,
the pastures are cloth'd with flocks,
the valleys are cover'd over with corn,
they shout for joy, thay also sing,

[TRIO for Treble, Tenor and Bass]
O Lord how manifold are thy works! 
in wisdom hast thou made them all, 
thy earth is full of thy riches.

[CHORUS] 
The Lord is great, and greatly to be prais’d, 
the Lord is great, and greatly to be prais’d. 
Give unto the Lord, (Give unto the Lord,)
O ye kindred of the people, (O ye kindred of the people,) 
Give unto the Lord, 
Glory and strength, 
Give unto the Lord, 
Glory and strength. 

[SOLO for Treble and Bass]
O worship him in the beauty of holiness, 
fear before him all the earth 
O worship him, 
O worship him in the beauty, 
beauty of holiness. 

[CHORUS] 
The Lord is great, and greatly to be prais’d, 
the Lord is great, and greatly to be prais’d. 
Give unto the Lord, (Give unto the Lord,)
O ye kindred of the people, (O ye kindred of the people,) 
Give unto the Lord, 
Glory and strength, 
Give unto the Lord, 
Glory and strength. 
[BASS]Amen, 
Amen, Amen.
