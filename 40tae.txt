1. Far from the dark and rolling main
That leaves my country’s shore,
I roam an exile on the plain,
From all that I adore.
An exile in a foreign land—
“Home of the brave and free;”
Tho’ rich the soil and bright the strand,
My heart still clings to thee.
  Tho’ rich the soil and bright the strand,
  My heart still clings to thee.

2. Already has the purple dawn
Illum’d the clouds of jet;
The sun has lit yon  orange lawn
But where, where shall he set?
The sun shall set where thou art blest,
Beyond the billowey sea;
And sinking with him in the West—
My thoughts still turned to thee.
  And sinking with him in the West—
  My thoughts still turned to thee.

3. And as my sun of life speeds,
And death comes darkly on;
As my last ray of life recedes,
And ev’ry hope begone;
Then with my latest parting breath—
“Home of the brave and free;”
I’ll fondly close my eyes   in death—
My thoughts still turned to thee.
  I’ll fond ly close my eyes in death—
  My thoughts still turned to thee.
