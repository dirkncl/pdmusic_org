"Sixty-Three Is the Jubilee" (1863)
Words by J. L. Greene
Music by D. A. French

1.
Oh, darkeys hab ye heerd it, hab ye heerd de joyful news?
Uncle Abra'm's gwine to free us, and he'll send us where we chuse;
For de Jubilee is comin', don't ye sniff it in de air!
And SISTY-THREE IS DE JUBILEE for de darkeys eb'rywhere!

CHORUS
Oh, de Jubilee is comin',
Don't ye sniff it in the air?
And SISTY-THREE IS DE JUBILEE
For de darkeys eb'rywhere!

2.
Ole massa, he hab heerd it, don't it make him awful blue?
Won't Ole Missus be a ravin' when she finds it comin' true?
'Specs dar'll be a dreffle shakin', such as Jeffy cannot stand--
'Cause kingdom kum is a movin' now, and a clawin' tro' de land!

(CHORUS)

3.
No more we'll work for nuffin', but we'll own a little farm,
And no more dey'll sell our chil'en, but we'll keep 'em from all harm;
And no more we'll pick de cotton, and no more we'll feel de lash,
We'll shout, and drum on de ole banjo, 'till we break it all to smash!

(CHORUS)

4.
Dar'll be a big ske-daddle, now ole sixty-three hab come!
And de darkeys dey will holler 'till dey make de country hum.
Oh, we tanks Ole Uncle Abra'm, yes, we bress him day and night,
And pray de Lord bress de Union folks, and de battle for de right.

(CHORUS)
