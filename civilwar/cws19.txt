"Comrades, I Am Dying!" (1864)
Song & Chorus
Words by Thomas Manahan,
Music by B. Sontag.

1.
Comrades, comrades, I am dying!
See the crimson fountain flow!
Sick and wounded, I am dying
On the field among the foe.
But the angels hover round me.
They will guard me while I sleep;
Comrades, onward to the battle,
Do not for the soldier weep.

CHORUS
Comrades, comrades, dying!
See the crimson fountain flow!
Sick and wounded, I am dying
On the field among the foe.

2.
Comrades, comrades, I am dying!
For I see me mother now:
See her coming down from heaven
With a wreath upon her brow.
God has sent her to the soldier,
She will teach him how to die;
And, when He has called my spirit
She will bear it to the sky.

(CHORUS)

3.
Comrades, comrades, I am dying!
Soon I'll be among the blessed.
Fare--oh! fare you well for ever,
I am going there to rest.
For my mother's arms entwine me,
And I can no longer stay;
Onward, comrades, to the battle,
Angels they will lead the way.

(CHORUS)
