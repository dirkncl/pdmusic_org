"O I'm a Good Old Rebel" (circa 1863-1865)
A Chaunt to the Wild Western Melody, "Joe Bowers."
Respectfully dedicated to the Honorable Thaddeus Stevens
by "IR"

1.
O I'm a good old rebel,
  Now that's just what I am,
For this "fair Land of Freedom"
  I do not care AT ALL;
I'm glad I fit against it--
  I only wish we'd won
And I don't want no pardon
  For anything I done.

2.
I hates the Constitution,
  This Great Republic, too,
I hate the Freedman's Buro,
  In uniforms of blue;
I hates the nasty eagle,
  With all his braggs and fuss,
The lyin', thievin' Yankees,
  I hates 'em wuss and wuss.

3.
I hates the Yankee nation
  And everything they do,
I hates the Declaration
  Of Independence too;
I hates the glorious Union--
  'Tis dripping with our blood--
I hates the striped banner,
  I fit it all I could.

4.
I followed old mas' Robert
  For four year, near about,
Got wounded in three places
  And started at Pint Lookout;
I cotch the roomatism
  A campin' in the snow,
But I killed a chance o' Yankees,
  I'd like to kill some mo'.

5.
Three hundred thousand yankees
  Is stiff in Southern dust;
We GOT three hundred thousand
  Before they conquered us;
They died of Southern fever
  And Southern steel and shot,
I wish they was three million
  Instead of what we got.

6.
I can't take up my musket
  And fight 'em now no more,
But I ain't a going to love 'em,
  Now that is sartin sure;
And I don't want no pardon
  For what I was and am,
I won't be reconstructed
  And I don't care a dam.
