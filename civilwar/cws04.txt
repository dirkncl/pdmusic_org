1.
I wish I was in the land ob cotton,
Old time dar am not forgotten;
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.
In Dixie Land whar I was born in,
Early on one frosty mornin,
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.

CHORUS
Den I wish I was in Dixie,
Hooray! Hooray!
In Dixie Land, I'll took my stand,
To lib and die in Dixie,
Away, away,
Away down south in Dixie,
Away, away,
Away down douth in Dixie.

2.
Old Missus marry "Will-de-weaber,"
Willum was a gay deceaber;
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.
But when he put his arm around 'er,
He smiled as fierce as a 'forty-pound'er,
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.

(CHORUS)

3.
His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaber,
But dat did not seem to greab 'er;
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.
Old Missus acted de foolish part,
And died for a man dat broke her heart,
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.

(CHORUS)

4.
Now here's a health to the next old Missus,
An all de galls dat want to kiss us;
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.
But if you want to drive 'way sorrow,
Come an hear did song to-morrow.
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.

(CHORUS)

5.
Dar's buck-wheat cakes and 'Ingen' batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter;
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.
Den hoe it down and scratch your grabble,
To Dixie Land I'm bound to trabble,
  Look away! Look away!
  Look away! Dixie Land.

(CHORUS)
