"The Southron's Chaunt of Defiance" (1861)
Words by a Lady of Kentucky
Music by Armand Edwand Blackmar

1.
You can never win us back;
  Never! Never!
Tho' we perish in the track
  of your endeavor;
Tho' our corpses strew the earth
Smiling now on our birth,
And tho' blood polute each hearth
  Now and ever!

CHORUS
You can never win us back;
  Never! Never!
Tho' we perish in the track
  Of your endeavor;
Tho' our corpses strew the earth
Smiling now on our birth,
And tho' blood polute each hearth
  Now and ever!

2.
We have risen to a man,
  Stern and fearless;
Of your curses, of your ban,
  We are careless.
Ev'ry hand is on its knife,
Ev'ry gun is primed for strife.
Ev'ry palm contains a Life
  High and peerless.

CHORUS
We have risen to a man,
  Stern and fearless;
Of your curses, of your ban,
  We are careless.
Ev'ry hand is on its knife,
Ev'ry gun is primed for strife.
Ev'ry palm contains a Life
  High and peerless.

3.
You have no such blood as our
  For the shedding;
In the veins of Cavaliers
  Was its heading!
You have no such stately men
In you abolution den
Marching through foe and fen,
  Nothing dreading!

CHORUS

  For the shedding;
In the veins of Cavaliers
  Was its heading!
You have no such stately men
In you abolution den
Marching through foe and fen,
  Nothing dreading!

4.
We may fall before the fire
  Of your legions,
Paid with gold for murderous hire,
  Bought allegiance;
But for every drop you shed,
You shall have a mound of dead,
So that vultures may be fed
  In our regions!

CHORUS

Paid with gold for murderous hire,
  Bought allegiance;
But for every drop you shed,
You shall have a mound of dead,
So that vultures may be fed
  In our regions!

5.
But the battle to the strong
  Is not given,
While the Judge of right and wrong
  Sits in Heaven
And the God of David still
Guides the pebble in His will,
There are giants yet to kill,
  Wrongs unshriven!
