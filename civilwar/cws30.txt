"Mother Is the Battle Over?" (circa 1861-1865)
by Benedict E. Roeffs

Mother is the battle over?
Mother is the battle over?
Thousands, thousands have been kill'd they say;
Is my Father coming? tell me,
Have our soldiers gain'd the fay?
Is he well or is he wounded?
Mother do you think he's slain?
If you know, I pray you tell me,
Will my father come again, will father come again?

Mother dear you're always sighing
Since you last the paper read...
Tell me why you now are crying
Why that cap is on youy head?
Why that cap is on your head?
Ah! I see you can tell me not,
Father's one among the slain;
Altho' he lov'd us very dearly,
He will never come again!
He will never come again.
