To Miss Van Wyck,
"The Soldier's Return" (1862)
Ballad
Words by William H. Morris
Music John Rogers Thomas

1.
We parted with a cheerful smile,
When last I press'd her hand,
To follow to the battlefield
The Banner of our Land,
The Banner of our Land;
Her glowing glance in memory
Unceasingly will burn--

[CHORUS]
For well I know she will bestow,
For well I know she will bestow,
For well I know she will bestow
The same when I return!
For well I know she will bestow,
The same when I return!

2.
When gazing at the glimm'ring stars,
And resting on the ground,
While soldiers, wearied by the march,
Are slumbering around,
Are slumbering around;
How oft, to hold that little hand,
And here her vows I yearn--

([CHORUS])
