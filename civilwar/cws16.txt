To "Our Deluded Brethern"
"The Grant Pill" (or "Unconditional Surrender") (1864)
Words by Harriet L. Castle
Music Arranged by James Cox Beckel

1.
You see my jolly comrades
We are ripe and prime for battle
We heeded not the cannon's roar nor grape shot's hissing rattle
We were sworn to Death or victory for our Union God defend her
And to only take from Rebels unconditional surrender,

REFRAIN
unconditional, unconditional,
unconditional surrender.

2.
Amidst the din of warfare and the shrieks of host a-dying
We heard a shout of triumph, saw the flag of truce a-flying
And we knew the rebel leader a petition came to tender
But our gallant General Grant-ed unconditional surrender,

(REFRAIN)

3.
"'Tis unchivalric treatment
To a man in my condition
But I yield me" said the leader so our armies gain'd admission
Then our Flag went up instanter as she must, when braves defend her
And while leaders have this warcry "Unconditional surrender."

(REFRAIN)

4.
Hurrah! then for our Union
Our Flag and Constitution,
While we've hands and hearts for battle we will have no dissolution,
Hurrah then for our Union, peace and Liberty attend her
And hence forth be this our warcry unconditional surrender,

(REFRAIN)
