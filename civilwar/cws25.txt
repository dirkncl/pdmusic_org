"Weeping, Sad and Lonely"
or "When This Cruel War Is Over" (1862)
Words by Charles Carroll Sawyer
Music Composed and Arranged by Henry Tucker

1.
Dearest love, do you remember
When we lst did meet,
How you told me that you loved me,
Kneeling at my feet?
Oh! how proud you stood before me,
In your suit of blue,
When you vow'd to me and country,
Ever to be true.

CHORUS
Weeping, sad and lonely,
Hopes and fears, how vain, (Yet praying)
When this cruel war is over,
Praying! that we meet again.

(CHORUS pp)

2.
When the summer breeze is sighing,
  Mournfully along!
Or when autumn leaves are falling,
  Sadly breathes the song.
Oft in dreams I see thee lying,
  Oh the battle plain,
Lonely, wounded, even dying;
  Calling, but in vain. 

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS pp)

3.
If amid the din of battle,
  Nobly you should fall,
Far away from those who love you,
  None to hear your call.
Who would whisper words of comfort,
  Who would soothe your pain?
Ah! the many cruel fancies,
  Ever in my brain. 

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS pp)

4.
But our country called you, darling,
  Angels cheer your way,
While our nation's sons are fighting,
  We can only pray.
Nobly strike for God and liberty,
  Let all nations see
How we love our starry banner,
  Emblem of the free.

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS pp)
