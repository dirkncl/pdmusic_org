1.
The despot's heel is on the shore,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
His touch is at thy temple door,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Avenge the patriotic gore,
That fleck'd the streets of Baltimore,
Ands be the Battle Queen of yore,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

2.
Hark to a wand'ring Son's appeal!
  Maryland, My Maryland!
My Mother-State! to thee I kneel,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
For life and death, for woe and weal,
Thy peerless chivalry reveal,
And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

3.
Thou wilt not cower in the dust,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Thy beaming sword shall never rust,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Remember Carroll's sacred trust,
Remember Howard's warlike thrust--
And all thy slumbers with the just,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

4.
Come! for thy shield is bright and strong,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Come! for thy dalliance, does thee wrong,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Come! to thine own heroic throng,
That stalks with Liberty along,
And give a new Key to thy song,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

5.
Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Virginia should not call in vain!
  Maryland, My Maryland!
She meets her sisters on the plain--
"Sic temper" tis the proud refrain,
That baffles minions back amain,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

6.
I see the blush upon the cheek,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
But thou wast ever bravely meek,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
But lo! there surges forth a shriek
From hill to hill, from creek to creek--
Potomac calls to Chesapeake,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

7.
Thou wilt not yield the vandal toll,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Thou wilt not crook to his control,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
Better the fire upon thee roll,
Better the fire upon the roll,
Better the blade, the shot, the bowl,
Than crucifixion of the soul,
  Maryland, My Maryland!

8.
I hear the distant thunder-hum,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
The Old Line's bugle, fife and drum,
  Maryland, My Maryland!
She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb--
Huzza! she spurns the Northern scum!
She breathes--she burns! she'll come! she'll come!
  Maryland, My Maryland!
