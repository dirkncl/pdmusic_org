"Glory! Glory!"
or "The Little Octoroon" (1866)
by George Frederick Root

1.
Near the old plantation,
At the close of day,
Stood the weary Mother and her child,
List'ning to the sounds
Along the valley's way,
While their hearts with hope were throbbing wild!

CHORUS
Glory! Glory!
How the Freedmen sang!
Glory! Glory!
How the old woods rang!
'Twas the loyal army
Sweeping to the sea,
Flinging out the banner of the Free!

2.
Fly, my precious darling,
To the Union camp;
I will keep the hounds and hunters here.
Go right through the forest
Though 'tis dark and damp,
God will keep you, dear one, never fear.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the blazing campfires
Gleam'd amid the wood,
And the boys were halting for the night.
In her wond'rous beauty
Little Rosa stood
Trembling and alone, before their sight.

(CHORUS)

4.
Then the brave old gunner
Took her in his arms,
Thinking of his own dear ones at home.
And though all the marches,
And their rude alarms
Safely brought the little Octoroon.

(CHORUS)
