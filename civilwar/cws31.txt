"Grafted Into The Army" (1862)
by Henry Clay Work, No. 13

1.
Our Jimmy has gone for to live in a tent,
They have grafted him into the army;
He finally pucker'd up courage and went,
When they grafted him into the army.
I told them the child was too young, alas!
At the captains forequarters, they said he would pass--
They'd train him up well in the Infantry class--
So they grafted him into the army. 

CHORUS 
Oh, Jimmy, farewell!
Your brothers fell
Way down in Alabarmy;
I though they would spare a lone widder's heir,
But they grafted him into the army.

2.
Drest up in his unicorn, dear little chap;
They have grafted him into the army;
It seems but a day since he sot in my lap,
But they grafted him into the army.
And these are the trousies he used to wear--
Them very same buttons--the patch and the tear--
But Uncle Sam gave him a bran new pair
When they grafted him into the army. 

(CHORUS)

3.
Now in my provisions I see him revealed--
They have grafted him into the army;
A picket beside the contented field,
they have grafted him into the army.
He looks kinder sickish--begins to cry--
A big volunteer standing right in his eye!
Oh what if the ducky should up and die
Now they've grafted him into the army.

(CHORUS)
