===========
Words dedicated to and sung by the Fourth Battalion of Rifles,
13th Regiment, Massachusettes Volunteers.

1. Cheer for the banner as we rally 'neath its stars,
As we join the Northern legion and are off for the wars,
Ready for the onset, for bullet, blood and scars!
  Cheer for the dear old flag!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Glory! Glory! Glory for the North!
Glory to the soldiers she is sending forth!
Glory! Glory! Glory for the North!
  They'll conquer as they go.

2. Cheer for the sweethearts we are now forced to leave,
Think of us, lassies, but for us don't grieve,
Bright be the garlands that for us you'll weave,
  When we return to your smiles.

3. Blank looks in Dixie when Northern troops come!
Sad hearts in Dixie when they hear the victor's drum!
Pale cheeks in Dixie when cattle, shell and bomb,
  And down goes the Dixie rag!

4. Swift heels in Dixie, but swifter on their track!
We'll meet them on their stomping groung and quickly drive 'em back!
Nimble feet in Dixie when they hear the rifle's crack
  Of the Old Bay States' Thirteenth!
