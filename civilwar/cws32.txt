"Jeff in Petticoats" (1865)
A Song for the times.
Words by George Cooper
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Jeff Davis was a hero bold, you've heard of him, I know,
He tried to make himself a King where southern breezes blow;
But "Uncle Sam," he laid the youth across his mighty knee,
And spanked him well, and that's the end of brave old Jeffy D.

CHORUS
Oh! Jeffy D! you "flow'r of chivalry,"
Oh royal Jeffy D! ... your
Empire's but a tin-clad skirt, oh, charming Jeffy D.

2.
This Davis, he was always full of bluster and of brag,
He swore, on all our Northern walls he'd plant his rebel rag;
But when to battle he did go, he said, "I'm not so green,
To dodge the bullets, I will wear my tin-clad crinoline."

(CHORUS)

3.
Now when he saw the game was up, he started for the woods,
His band-box hung upon his arm quite full of fancy goods:
Said Jeff, "They'll never take me now, I'm sure I'll not be seen,"
"They'd never think to look for me beneath my Crinoline."

(CHORUS)

4.
Jeff took with him, the people say, a mine of golden coin,
Which he from banks and other places, managed to purloin:
But while he ran, like every thief, he had to drop the spoons,
And may-be that's the reason why he dropped his pantaloons!

5.
Our Union boys were on his track for many nights and days,
His palpitating heart it beat, enough to burst his stays,
O! what a dash he must have cut with form so tall and lean;
Just fancy now the "What is it," dressed up in Crinoline!

(CHORUS)
6.
The Ditch that Jeff was hunting for, he found was very near;
He tried to "shift" his base again, his neck felt rather queer;
Just on the out-"skirts" of a wood his dainty shape was seen,
He boots stuck out, and now they'll hang old Jeff in Crinoline.

(CHORUS)
