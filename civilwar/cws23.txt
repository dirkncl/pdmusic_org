"Bear Gently, So Gently, the Roughly Made Bier" (1864)
(or "Burial at Camp")
A Touching Ballad.
Words by Mrs. E. A. B. Mitchell
Music by Chr. Mathias

1.
Bear gently, so gently the roughly made bier,
Perchance the freed spirit is hovering near,
Then let her last tributes of tenderness prove
The truth of your homage, the depth of your love,
Now halt be the graveside, the coffin lid raise;
Once more on your comrade in mute sorrow gaze;
How calmly he sleeps in his blanket all gore,
His sword by his side--ah he'll need it no more,
  His sword by his side--ah he'll need it no more.

2.
Draw near ye, the truest, the freest from guile,
And kiss the cold lips that will never more smile;
For that dear mother's sake, who will gratefully bless;
From the damp clotted hair, sever one precious tress,
And then the lid softly but, firmly replace;
Great God! there is one that to look on that face,
And there there by his side in that coffin to lie,
Would willingly, cheefully, happily die,
  Would willingly, cheefully, happily die.

3.
Ay linger one moment in silence to pray,
For those who will sorrow far away;
For her will read o'er the list of the lost;
Allay what deep sorrow doth history cost!
But lower down carefully into the grave
The brother so kind and the soldier so brave;
There, lay the turf lightly above his calm breast,
And leave him with God until judgement to rest!
  And leave him with God until judgement to rest!

4.
And while o'er his form peals the loud booming gun,
Remember that he hath his last battle won--
Hath conquered the foe bravest may dread,
And the crown of the victor shall rest on his head.
Then on unto battle undaunted again,
Nor think ye one here hath fallen in vain;
The blood of each martyr cries loudly to God,
And traitors shall bow 'neath his almighty rod,
  And traitors shall bow 'neath his almighty rod.
