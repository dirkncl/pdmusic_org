"We Are Coming Father Abra'am 300,000 More" (1862)
Words by James Sloan Gibbons
Music by Luther Orlando Emerson

1.
We are coming, Father Abra'am, three hundred thousand more,
From Mississsippi's winding stream and from New England's shore;
We leave our plows and workshops our wives and children dear,
With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear;
We dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before--

REFRAIN
We are coming, Father, Abra'am--three hundred thousand more!

CHORUS
We are coming, we are coming,
Our Union to restore;
We are coming, Father Abra'am with three hundred thousand more,
We are coming, Father Abra'am with three hundred thousand more.

2.
If you look across the hill tops that meet the northern sky,
Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;
And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy veil aside,
And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride'
And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour--

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
If you look all up our valleys, Where the growing harvest shine,
You may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming into line;
And children from their mother's knees are pulling at the weeds,
And learning how to reap and sow, against their country's needs;
And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door--

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide,
To lay us down for freedom's sake, our brother's bone beside;
Or from foul treason's savage group, to wrench the murderous blade,
And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade;
Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before--

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
