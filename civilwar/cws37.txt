"We Are Coming from the Cotton Fields" (1864)
Words by J. C___n.
Music by J. C. Wallace

1.
We are coming from the cotton fields,
We're coming from afar;
We have left the plow, the hoe and ax
And are going to the  war;
We have left old plantation seat,
The sugar and the cane,
Where we work'd and toil'd with weary feet.
In sun and wind and rain.

CHORUS
Then come along my boys,
Oh! come, come along,
Then come along my brothers,
Oh come, come along.
We are coming from the cotton fields.
We're coming from a far,
We have left the plow the hoe and ax,
And we are going to war.

2.
We have digg'd our last pertater here
In old Carliner State,
And we'll leave these sandy diggins now
For the true Confederate;
We have left the frogs within the slough
To sing alone and hop
In the swamp lands and the meadows where
We reap'd old Massa's crop.

(CHORUS)

3.
We will leave our chains behind us, boys,
The prison, and the rack;
And we'll hide beneath a soldier's coat.
The scars upon upon our backs;
And we'll teach the world a lesson soon.
If taken by the hand,
How the night shall come before tis noon,
Upon old Pharoah's land.

(CHORUS)

4.
By the heavy chains that bound our hands
Thro' centuries of wrong,
We have learn'd the hard bought lesson well,
How to suffer and be strong;
And we only ask the power to show,
What Freedom does for man;
And we'll give sign to friend and foe,
As none beside us can.

(CHORUS)
