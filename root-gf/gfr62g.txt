"The Battle Cry of Freedom" (1862)
Words and Music
by George Frederick Root

1.
Yes we'll rally round the flag, boys,
we'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom,
And we'll rally from the hillside
we'll gather from the plain,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

CHORUS
The Union forever,
Hurrah boys, hurrah!
Down with the Traitor,
Up with the Star;
While we rally round the flag, boys,
Rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

2.
We are springing to the call
Three Hundred Thousand more,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom,
And we'll fill the vacant ranks of
our brothers gone before,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

(CHORUS)

3.
We will welcome to our numbers
the loyal true and brave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom,
And altho' he may be poor he
shall never be a slave,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

(CHORUS)

4.
So we're singing to the call from
the East and from the West,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom,
And we'll hurl the rebel crew from
the land we love the best,
Shouting the battle cry of Freedom.

(CHORUS)
