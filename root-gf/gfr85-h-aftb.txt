1.
As flies the bird on eager wing,
To mountains far away,
So takes my soul its upward flight,
In loving thoughts today.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The mountains, the mountains,
So high, so sweet, so pure,
Where far above the taint of earth,
The ransomed dwell secure.

2.
I see the mountain where Jesus taught!
The mount of glory, too!
And there--most precious of them all--
Comes Cavalry into view.

3.
I see the mountains from which the law
By Moses' hand was given:
I see the mount from which the Lord
Ascended in to heaven.

4.
I see the mountain whereon the wall
Of Zion's city stands--
The golden streets and mansions fair,
Not made with human hands.
