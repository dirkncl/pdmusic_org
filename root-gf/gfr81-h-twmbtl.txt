"The Wise May Bring Their Learning" (1881)
Words -- Anonymous
Music by George Frederick Root
[ELLON, 7.6.7.6.D.]

1.
The wise may bring their learning,
The rich may bring their wealth,
And some may bring their greatness,
And some bring strength and health;
We, too, would bring our treasures
To offer to the King;
We have no wealth or learning:
What shall the children bring?

2.
We'll bring Him hearts that love Him;
We'll bring Him thankful praise,
And young souls meekly striving
To walk in holy ways:
And these shall be the treasures
We offer to the King,
And these are gifts that even
The poorest child may bring.

3.
We'll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;
We'll try our best to please Him,
At home, at school, at play:
And better are these treasures
To offer to the King,
Than richest gifts without them;
Yet these a child may bring. A-men.
