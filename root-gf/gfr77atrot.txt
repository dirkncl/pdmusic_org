"Along the River of Time" (1877)
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
Along the river of time I glide,
Along the river, along the river,
My little boat rocking from side to side
light boat rocking, my light boat rocking,
Yes where-so-ever the winds do blow,
Still hither, thither I drifting go.

REFRAIN
Floating, (floating,)
floating, (floating,)
Out on the sea of Eternity,
Floating, (floating,)
floating, (floating,)
Out on the sea of eternity.

2.
How oft I gaze from my windows twain,
How oft I'm gazing, how oft I'm gazing,
Far over the waves of the billowy main
o'er the billow, Far o're the billow,
And million sails in the blue air shine,
And many whiter but none like mine.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Some, while I'm gazing, sail out of site,
While yet I'm gazing, While yet I'm gazing,
Far into the sunset's all radiant light
radiant sunset, The radiant sunset,
I see not, know not their onward track,
I only know that they come not back.

(REFRAIN)
