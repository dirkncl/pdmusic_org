1. Oh! merry goes the time
When the heart is young,
There is nought too hard to climb
When the heart is young;
A spirit of delight
Scatters roses in its flight,
And there’s magic in the night,
When the heart is young.

2. But weary go the feet
When the heart is old;
Time cometh not so sweet
When the heart is old;
From all that smiled and shone
There is something lost and gone,
And our friends are few or none,
When the heart is old.

3. Oh! sparkling are the skies
When the heart is young;
There is bliss in beauty’s eyes
When the heart is young;
The golden break of sky
Bringeth gladness in its ray,
And every month is May,
When the heart is young.

4. But the sun is setting fast
When the heart is old;
And the sky is overcast
When the heart is old;
Life’s worn and weary bark
Lies tossing wild and dark,
And the star hath left hope’s ark,
When the heart is old.
