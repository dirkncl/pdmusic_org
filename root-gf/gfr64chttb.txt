1.
Comrades hasten to the battle,
Leave me here alone to die;
While the cannon roar and rattle,
Quickly to the conflict fly!
For the angels dwell around me,
They their vigils o'er me keep;
Hasten, hasten to the battle,
I would not like a soldier's sleep.
  I would not like a soldier's sleep.

CHORUS
"Comrades, hasten to the battle,"
Unto death I'll calmly bow,
For upon the road to heaven
I see soldiers I see soldiers
I see soldiers marching now
  I see soldiers marching now.

2.
Comrades hasten to the battle,
Do not linger here with me;
Soon I'll leave this scene forever,
Soon my spirit will be free.
Angels soon will bear me upwards
From this weary world of care,
To a home where all is gladness,
In the starry heaven's there.
  In the starry heaven's there.

(CHORUS)

3.
Comrades hasten to the battle!
Unto death I'll calmly bow,
For upon the road to heaven
I see soldiers marching now.
I am going, comrades, going!
Fare thee well, oh, fare thee well!
Hasten, hasten to the battle,
I will soon with angels dwell.
  I will soon with angels dwell.

(CHORUS)
