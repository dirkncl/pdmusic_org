1.
Call them in, the poor, the wretched,
Call the wand'rers to the fold;
Peace and pardon freely offer,
Can you weigh their worth in gold?

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Call them in the weary wand'rers,
Christ is waiting, call them in.

2.
Call them in, the broken-hearted,
Bending 'neath their load of shame;
Speak love's message low and tender,
'Twas for sinners Jesus came.

3.
Forth the Master comes to meet them,
He hath all their sorrows seen;
Robe and ring, and royal sandals
Wait the lost ones, call them in.
