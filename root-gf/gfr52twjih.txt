1. There was joy in heaven, 
There was joy in heaven, 
When this goodly world to frame, 
The Lord of might and glory came; 
Shouts of joy were heard on high, 
And the stars sang from the sky, 
Glory to God in heaven, 
Glory to God in heaven. 

2. There was joy in heaven, 
There was joy in heaven, 
When of love the midnight beam 
Dawned on towers of Bethlehem; 
And along the echoing hill, 
Angels sang on earth goodwill, 
Glory to God in heaven, 
Glory to God in heaven.
