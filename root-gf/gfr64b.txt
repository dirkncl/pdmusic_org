"Can the Soldier Forget?" (1864)
Words by Charles Boynton
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Yes, beloved ones at home we remember
Ah, how can the soldier forget;
All the vows that were said when we parted
Are sacred and dear to him yet.
When the night throws its mantle around us,
We dream neath the heaven's starry dome;
Of the dear whose sweet spell has bound us,
And whose voices shall welcome us home.

Chorus
Yes, beloved ones at home we remember
Ah, how can the soldier forget;
All the vows that were said when we parted
Are sacred and dear to him yet.

2.
Of the deeds that are hallowed in story,
We think as we press on our way;
And the pathway that leads on to glory,
Gleams brightly before us today
For the millions that wait on our efforts,
And myriads the future shall claim;
When the peans of vict'ry are sounding,
Shall most joyfully echo each name.

Repeat Chorus

3.
Oh ye hearts that with anguish are swelling,
Ye eyes, that are darkenned with fear,
For the brave ones you loved past the telling
The fallen that sleep with us here,
They have burst now the fetters that bound them,
And high mid the heav'n's brightest ray,
E'en with glories immortal around them,
They are looking upon us today.

Repeat Chorus
