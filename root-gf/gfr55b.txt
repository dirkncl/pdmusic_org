To Henry F. Call, Esq.
"Father John" (1855)
Song and Chorus
As sung by
George Christy and Wood's Minstrels
444 Broadway, NY
Composed by 
George Frederick Root [Wurtzel]

1.
When the bright day is fading
With the gay hues it wore,
Gather we all round Father John,
As he's sitting by the cottage door;
All the long day he labors hard,
But at evening when his foils are o'er,
Kindly be welcome one and all
As we gather round the cottage door.

CHORUS
Father John, Father John,
Such good times come no more,
For here the best friends we e'er shall know,
Come at evening round the cottage door.

2.
Merrily ring our voices,
As the old strains we pour,
Joining the streamlets melody,
As it ripples by the cottage door;
But the glad hours are hush'd and still,
And our thoughts to fairy regions roar,
While the old tales of Father John,
Bring us closer round the cottage door.

CHORUS
Father John, Father John,
Such good times come no more,
For loving and true companions all,
We are gather'd round the cottage door.

3.
Once in that happy dwelling,
Fondly a maiden smiled,
Fair were her locks of auburn hue,
And her gentle eyes were soft and mild;
Idol she was of Father John,
But hears her silv'ry voice no more --
Vainly he seeks his darling child,
In the groups round the cottage door.

CHORUS
Father John, Father John,
We'll meet those gone before
When e'er the old place we love to fill,
Shall be vacant by the cottage door.

4.
Gladly we hear his counsels,
Loving him all the more,
For the advise he gladly gives,
As we sit around the cottage door;
Sweetly he tells of a better land,
Where his dreams but have gone before,
There may we meet, when here no more,
We shall gather round the cottage door.

CHORUS
Father John, Father John,
We'll meet those gone before
When e'er the old place we love to fill,
Shall be vacant by the cottage door.
