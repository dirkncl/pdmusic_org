1. 
Oh will my mother never come
And kiss me ere I die
For in my long and silent home
I close my wishful eye.
My sands of life are less’ning fast
E’en like yon setting sun,
The gulf of time will soon be passed,
Its furlough soon begun.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
But no! she will not come
Ah no! she cannot come.
Farewell my gallant comrades,
I’m on my journey home.
Farewell my gallant comrades,
I’m on my journey home.

2. 
If she were here to soothe my pain,
I feel I should not die.
I would rejoice and live again
And greet the morning sky.
’Tis true that kindest friends are near
Who speak in softest tones
But vainly do they strive to cheer,
I think of one alone.

3. 
Full often did I dream of her
Beside the campfire’s flame
And felt my spirit proudly rise
To win myself a name
But now alas those dreams are o’er.
Death claims me for his own.
My heart will wake to deeds no more,
The wish for glory’s gone.

4. 
Now come the childish prayers I said,
The good night kiss at eve,
The thoughts of angels round my bed,
The hopes they used to weave
In these so innocent I sigh
And mother wert thou here
’Twould be but sleeping thus to die,
For thou would’st bring them near.
