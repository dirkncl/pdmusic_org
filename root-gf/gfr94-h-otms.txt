1.
Oh, that my song a word might bear
To cheer some soul by grief oppressed---
Some burdened heart bowed down with care,
And point the way to home and rest.

CHORUS
Dear Master, bless the humble strain,
And to its weakness, give thy power,
That some may here thy pardon gain,
And ever bless this happy hour.

2.
Oh, that my song might find a place
Amid the gay, from care set free,
And show them by thy heav'nly grace
The truer joy of serving thee.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh, that my song a note might sound,
To rouse each heart to zeal anew,
That faith may more and more abound,
That He will bless the work we do.

(CHORUS)
