To Miss Kate I. Brainard of St.Louis
"Sing Me to Sleep, Father" (Copyright filed Oct. 10, 1865)
Words by Eren E. Rexford
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Let me sit at your feet with my head on your knee,
For of all 'tis the place that is dearest to me.
Oh! how oft in my childhood you've soothed me to rest,
With your arm thrown around me my head on your breast,
Then you called me your darling, your own little bird,
Those songs were the sweetest my ears ever heard.
Oh! sing to me father although I may weep.

SOLO CHORUS
Sing me to sleep father sing me to sleep.
Sing me to sleep father, sing me to sleep.

2.
Oh! how often my father just here on your knee,
I have sat while the twilight fell over the lea,
And you told me of mother who drifted away
O'er the death-shadowed river, at sunset one day,
To the city Eternal where always is rest,
And left me her baby asleep on your breast,
My heart fills with memories solemn and deep.

(SOLO CHORUS)

3.
To the years that have vanished so quickly away,
Call my heart with its yearning and longing today,
Oh! the love that my heart in its innocence knew,
It was fair like an angel's dream tender and true,
Wilt thou come to me dear one where ever thou art,
And light up the love fires anew in my heart.
Oh! drive out the shadows that over me creep.

(SOLO CHORUS) 

4.
Oh! my father belov-ed the years that have flown,
Have my earth treasures taken and left me alone,
So in sadness and loneliness come I to you,
To the dear heart that's always so tender and true,
You will take me I know to your side as of yore,
And love and protect me and bless me once more.
Oh! sweet shall the harvest be whene'er you reap.

(SOLO CHORUS)
