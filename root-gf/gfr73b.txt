"Hear! Hear the Shout!",
or, "The People's Army" (1873)
New Farmers' Song
Words by Mrs. S. M. Smith
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Not with trumpet's peal,
Nor glitter of steel,
With no sound of the martial drum;
From the prairies wide,
And the green hills side,
Today do our legions come;
And many a hard won field attests
The strength of the sturdy arms,
That in [lazzling ?] toil
With the stubborn soil,
Have wrested these [smiling?] farms.

CHORUS
Hear! hear the shout
That today rings out
From a million voices clear;
Let the would be kings,
And corruption rings,
Fate's voice in the people hear.

2.
Earth's rodent waste,
We have still replaced,
With the wealth of the waving grain,
And life's last years,
With its hopes and fears,
Have been spent in the strife in vain;
For what avails,
When labor fails
To gather its just rewards,
And the fields we plow,
And plant and sow,
Are reaped by our railway lords?

(CHORUS)

3.
Like the spritless slave,
We toil and save,
To give to their grasping hands
The fairest yield
Of our flock and field --
Aye, give in the end our lands;
Oh! men of the soil,
Rented soldier of toil,
For this did you brave the past,
In the blood bought home,
When peace had come,
That the stranger might dwell at last?

(CHORUS)

4.
Lo! hand in hand,
Over all the land,
Again do our armies grow;
And the arm that could settle
For the slave's birthright
May yet deal for its own a blow;
Though armed they come,
Without beat of drum,
Or herald of warlike notes,
With the tongue and pen
Of unbought men,
And freemen's unbought votes.

(CHORUS)
