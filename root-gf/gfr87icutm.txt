1. It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold;
“On earth be peace, goodwill to man,
From heav’n’s all gracious Kingl”
The earth in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing.
To hear (The angels sing,)
To hear, (The angels sing.)
The earth in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

2. Still thro’ the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still celestial music floats
O’er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on heavenly wing,
And ever o’er its Babel sounds
We hear the angels sing.
We hear (The angels sing,)
We hear (The angels sing,)
And ever o’er its Bable sounds
We hear the angels sing.

3. Oh, ye, beneath life’s  crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;—
Look up! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing,
Oh, rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.
And hear (The angels sing,)
And hear (The angels sing,)
Oh, rest beside the wearry road,
And hear the angels sing.
