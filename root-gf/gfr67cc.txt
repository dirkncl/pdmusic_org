1. 
O, come, brothers, all, ’tis Columbia’s earnest call, 
To make her people one again; 
Let some stand aloof from the old paternal roof, 
Whose shelter ne’er is sought in vain; 
Glorious the future rising o’er us, 
Blessed the era drawing nigh; 
Then join heart and hand for the weal of fatherland, 
Where’er the starry banners fly.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Glorious the future rising o’er us, 
Blessed the era drawing nigh; 
Then join heart and hand for the weal of fatherland, 
Where’er the starry banners fly
(the starry banners fly).

2. 
O! dark was the day when we met in deadly fray,
Dividing armies, friends and fleets;
O, wild was the wail that rang out o’er hill and dale,
As mourners went about the streets;
Now that the battle rage is over,
Now that the minute guns are cold,
O, haste, knit again what the sword hath cleft in twain,
Be friends and brothers, as of old.

3. 
O, fair smiles the dawn, now the shades of night are gone,
The dawning we have long’d to see,
When truth shall prevail, and our joyful anthems hail,
The glory of the brave and free;
Come, then, O, North and South, united,
Come, then, O,. East and West as one;
Rejoice in the light which has chased away the night,
And heralds now the rising sun.
