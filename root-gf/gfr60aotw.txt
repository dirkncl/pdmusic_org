1. 
[SOLO BARITONE]
Away! away! away! 
On the foam crusted wave 
of the blue deep are we, 
Yes, away! away! away! 
For our labor is out on the sea. 
[CHORUS with overlapping voices with SOLO BARITONE]
Away o’er the feathery crest 
of the bright blue sea, of the bright blue sea, 
Away. Away o’er the feathery crest 
of the bright blue sea, of the bright blue sea, 
Away, away, 
On the foamy wave of the deep are we, 
On the foamy wave of the deep are we, 
Then away, away o’er the crested wave, 
o’er the crested wave, 
Away, away, o’er the crested wave, 
o’er the crested wave, of the bright blue sea. 

[SOLO REFRAIN after each verse]
Then along pull to gether, 
Give adieu to the dear ones 
we’ve left on the shore, 
With a strong pull together, 
Let us hasten our prey to secure.
[CHORUS REFRAIN with overlapping voices for SOLO REFRAIN]
La la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la la la la la 
la la la la la la.

2. 
[SOLO BARITONE]
Away! away! away! 
Let the storm king arrive 
in his power on the deep, 
Still away! away! away! 
With a bold heart right onward we keep. 
[CHORUS [with overlapping voices with SOLO BARITONE]
Away o’er the feathery crest of the bright blue sea, of the bright blue sea, 
Away. Away o’er the feathery crest 
of the bright blue sea, of the bright blue sea, 
Away, away, 
On the foamy wave of the deep are we, 
On the foamy wave of the deep are we, 
Then away, away o’er the crested wave, 
o’er the crested wave, 
Away, away, o’er the crested wave, 
o’er the crested wave, of the bright blue sea. 
[FINE]

[REPEAT SOLO REFRAIN 2 with CHORUS REFAIN 2]
