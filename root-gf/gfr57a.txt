"Departed Days" (1857)
Song and Chorus
by George Frederick Root
Music arranged from the celebrated serenade
by L. Louis

1.
Sweet voices from the spirit land I hear,
Now breathing pure and holy lays
With heavenly tones awaking mem'ries dear,
Of loved and long desired days,

CHORUS
They come, beloved from the distant shore,
Where joy illumes with golden rays
And softly in each sorrowing heart they pour
Sweet mem'ries of departed days.

2.
When twilight's shadows veil the quiet earth,
And early stars bedrock the sky
When friends are gathered round the homestead hearth,
And cares of day are pasing by,

(CHORUS)

3.
When far from those most dear awhile we part,
In stranger lands to find a home
When long and weary days oppress the heart,
And in the throng we walk alone,

(CHORUS)
