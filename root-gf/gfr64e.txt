1.
Kiss me Mother, kiss your darling,
Lean my head upon your breast,
Fold your loving arms around me,
I am weary, let me rest.
Scenes of life are swiftly fading,
Brighter seems the other shore.
I am standing by the river,
Angels wait to waft me o'er.

CHORUS
Kiss me Mother, kiss your darling
(kiss you darling, Mother,)
Lean my head upon your breast, (upon your breast)
Fold your loving arms around me
(O fold your loving arms around me Mother)
I am weary, let me rest.

2.
Kiss me Mother, kiss your darling,
Breathe a blessing on my brow;
For I'll soon be with the angels,
Fainter grows my breath e'en now.
Tell the loved ones not to murmur,
Say I died our flag to save.
And that I shall slumber sweetly
In the soldier's honored grave.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh how dark this world is growing;
Hark! I hear the angel band;
How I long to join their number
In that fair and happy land.
Hear you not that heavenly music,
Floating near so soft and low
I must leave you farewell Mother!
Kiss me once before I go.

(CHORUS)
