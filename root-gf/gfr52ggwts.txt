(1)
Gently, gently wake the song,
Startly not her slumbers,
May her rest be sweet and long,
Unbroken by our numbers,
Unbroken by our numbers.

(2)
Let our music reach her ear,
Mingle with her dreaming,
Tho' she do not wake to hear,
She will dream our meaning,
She will dream our meaning.

(3)
May the mem'ry of the dream,
Linger thro' the morrow,
All a pleasing myst'ry seem,
Bequiling care and sorrow,
Bequiling care and sorrow.

(4)
Gently, gently breathe the song,
Startle no her slumbers,
May her rest be sweet and long,
Soften'd by our numbers,
Soften'd by our numbers.
