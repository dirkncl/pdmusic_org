1. At my work I’m always singing,
Tho’ the day be cold and long,
For my heart’s so full of music
That I can not stop my song.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I am singing, I'm singing,
Tho’ the days be cold and long,
For my heart’s so full of music
That I can not stop my song.

2. I am singing of the sunshine,
Tho’ the sky is dull and gray;
I am singing of the flowers
All the chilly winter day.

3. I am singing of the garden,—
Of the roses there in bloom,—
Of a thousand things in nature,
’Mid  the winter’s sullen gloom.
