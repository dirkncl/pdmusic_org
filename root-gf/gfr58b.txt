"Never Forget the Dear Ones" (1858)
A Home Song
Composed by
George Frederick Root

1.
Never forget the dear ones
Around the social hearth,
The sunny smiles of gladness,
The songs of artless mirth;
Though other scenes may woo thee,
In other lands to roam,
Never forget the dear ones,
That cluster round thy home,
Never forget never forget
Never forget the dear ones,
That cluster round thy home.

CHORUS
Never forget never forget
Never forget the dear ones,
That cluster round thy home.

2.
Ever their hearts are turning
To thee when far away,
Their love so pure and tender,
Is with thee on thy way;
Where ever thou may'st wander
Where ever though may'st roam,
Never forget the dear ones
That cluster round thy home,
Never forget never forget
Never forget the dear ones,
That cluster round thy home.

(CHORUS)

3.
Never forget the Father
Who cheerful toils for thee,
Within thy heart may ever
Thy Mother's image be;
Thy sister dear and brother
They long for thee to come,
Never forget the dear ones
That cluster round thy home,
Never forget never forget
Never forget the dear ones,
That cluster round thy home.

(CHORUS)
