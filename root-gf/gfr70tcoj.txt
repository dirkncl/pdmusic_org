1.
Question-- What story so sweet, is the song we are singing?
Answer-- We sing of the babe in the manger that lay.
Question-- What came the wise men from the east to him bringing?
Answer-- They brought him rich treasures from land far away.
SONG.
  And then the wise men went away.
    To distant Eastern lands.
  Nor would the cruel King obey,
    Nor heed the King's commands,
  For God to them made known the thought
    Of wicked Herod's mind,
  And why the little child he sought,
    So diligent to find.

2.
Question-- Where came they, one day, with the young child so holy?
Answer-- They entered the temple to make offering.
Question-- What bore they, the gift the poor and the lowly?
Answer-- They came, two young doves, with the infant to bring.
SONG.
  The Simon and Anna came,
    And took the little one,
  And blessed the Lord and praised his name,
    For his beloved son.
  And giving thanks to God on high,
    Rejoicingly they tell,
  The consolation nigh draws nigh
    To waiting Israel.

3.
Question-- Oh! why did they bear him away in his Childhood?
Answer-- No longer in Bethlehem safe could he stay.
Question-- Where bore they the bade, thru the desert and wildwood?
Answer-- They bore him by night into Egypt away.
SONG.
  Away from cruel Herod's power
    They took the little child,
  By mountain pass, at midnight hour,
    And o'er the desert wild.
  They wandered where the angel said,
    In Egypt's land to dwell,
  And when the wicked King was dead
    Came home to Israel.

4.
Question-- Why came they with Jesus from Egypt returning?
Answer-- An angel of God told the cruel King's death.
Question-- Where dwelt they, aside into Galilee turning?
Answer-- They lived in the city they called Nazareth.
SONG.
  Fair Nazareth upon the hills,
    Of humble Galilee;
  Thy olive groves and singing rills,
    Are beautiful to me,
  For here among the birds and flowers
    The gentle Mary's son
  Passed childhood's sunny, happy hours,
    Like me, a little one.

5.
Question-- How passed he twelve years, to the grace of God growing?
Answer-- He grew strong in spirit, in wisdom increased.
Question-- Now where shall we find him from Nazareth going?
Answer-- He comes to Jerusalem, up to the feast.
SONG.
  And up from Nazareth he went
    Through paths of Galilee,
  The hills and vales their beauty lent
    To such a child as he.
  The lovely lillies of the field,
    The birds that fill the air,
  Their sweet and gentle lessons yield
    To Jesus, walking there.

6.
Question-- Say, is he with Mary now, homeward returning?
Answer-- Ah! no, in the midst of the doctors he stays.
Question-- How long, while they seek, is he teaching and learning?
Answer-- Returning, they sorrowing sought him three days.
SONG.
  And when his mother said, Oh, why
    My son, didst thou this thing?
  Behold thy father, here, and I,
    Have sought thee, sorrowing?
  He turned and said, Why sought ye me?
    Oh! wist ye not that I
  About my Father's works must be?--
    His Father's work on high.

[7.]
SONG.
  No more of him, a child, I've learned,
    Yet, 'tis enough for me,
  He with his parents then returned,
    Obedient to be.
  That he who in Jerusalem
    Taught, as the scripture saith,
  Went down and subject was to them,
    In humble Nazareth.

[8.]
  Oh! thou who wast a child below
    Once, on the earth, like me,
  Now help me meek and mild to grow,
    And strong and wise, like thee!--
  In favor both with man and God,
    May we like him go on,
  And follow in the paths he trod,
    The well-beloved Son!
