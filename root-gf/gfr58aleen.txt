1. On the bright and beautiful shore
Of the silver Juna's stream,
In the vine clad cottage all bowered in the trees
Lived the gentle and lovely Aleen;
Where the morn's first glorious light
Woke the praise of bird and flower,
In its goldern radiance knelt the loving child,
With her meek eyes uplifted in prayer.

CHORUS [sung after each verses 1 and 2]
Oh! Aleena darling one, the river still runs by,
But the Pearl of Juna is shining far away
In the loveliest crown of the sky.

2. As the still waves sparkled with glee;
When the soft wind touched the stream,
So the sad heart wakened to life and joy anew
In the smile of the gentle Aleen;
To the loved ones in the old house,
To the friend and stranger too,
Her affection ever went earnest, pure and free
With her kind acts so loving and true.

3. Oh the eve was cloudless and still,
When the sister angels came,
And the dear life passed away gently to their arms
Leaving here every sorrow and pain;
On the far more beautiful shore
Of the stream of life so fair,
Are the gems too precious to grace an earthly home,
And my darling Aleena is there.

CHORUS [sung after 3rd verse only]
Yes upon that happy shore, the heavenly river by,
Is the Pearl of Juna fair shining evermore
In the loveliest crown of the sky.
