"O Blow de Horn!
or De Red Sea Waves,
the Negro Exodus" (1879)
Words by A.K. Owen
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
O blow de horn! O blow de horn,
Befo' de break ob day!
For 'fore de comin' ob de morn,
We mus' be on our way;
Dere's no mo' use in waitin' here,
We lift our hands in vain,
We mus' go thro' de wilderness,
De freeman's rights to gain.

CHORUS
De Red sea waves de rush an' roar,
But "Canyan" lan's in view;
O part de waters, bressed Lord,
An' take the children thro'.

2.
Our childun dey war bofe born here,
And here dey bofe have died;
An' now de win' sighs thro' de lin'
Where dey sleep side by side;
O blessed sleep! sleep on my dears,
But marm an' I mus' go,
De lan' dat us forty years
Can be our home no mo'.

(CHORUS)

3.
What is dat fallin' on yo' cheek?
Come Chloe wipe yo' eyes;
For we mus' find our way befo'
De norf star leaves de skies;
A bruised reed he will not break,
He see de sparrow's fall;
And he will hold our tremblin' han's,
De Lord is over all.

(CHORUS)
