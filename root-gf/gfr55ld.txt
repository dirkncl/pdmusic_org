"Little Daisy" (1855)
Ballad
The subject from RUTH HALL
  “Slowly the night waned and the stars paled. Up the gray
cast the golden sun slowly glided. One beam penetrated the
little window, hovering like a halo over Daisy’s sunny head.
A quick, convulsive start, and with one wild cry (as the
little throat filled to suffication,) the fair white arms
were tossed aloft, then dropped powerless upon the bed
of Death.”
	RUTH HALL, page 84.

1. 
Lit-tle Dai-sy, dar-ling! 
Where the birds are sing-ing, 
And the flowers are spring-ing, 
Qui-et is thy rest; 
Where the dew-drops glis-ten 
And the stream is la-ving 
And the wil-low wa-ving 
O’er thy peace-ful breast.

CHORUS
Dai-sy dear! Dai-sy dear! 
Cold thy brow 
But our lit-tle Dai-sy is an An-gel now.

2. 
Lit-tle Dai-sy, dar-ling! 
Where thy steps were stray-ing, 
In the green-wood play-ing, 
Mer-ry, light and gay; 
Oh how drear and lone-ly 
On the breez-es sigh-ing 
To our hearts re-ply-ing, 
Thou art gone a-way.

3. 
Lit-tle Dai-sy, dar-ling! 
Thou art gone for ev-er, 
And ’tis hard to sev-er, 
Ties so strong and deep; 
But the cher-ished blos-som 
By our Fa-ther giv-en 
Is re-called to Hea-ven, 
And we may not weep.
