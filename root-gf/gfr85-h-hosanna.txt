"Hosanna" (1885)
(If there is a good chorus of adult voices,
all the children may sing the Obligato, or 
if not, a few voices may be selected for that 
part, and the remainder of children and adults 
sing the chorus.)

CHORUS
Hear the children cry as the King draws nigh,

1. [sung with overlapping voices]
[Children]
Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna, hosanna, 
Our King rides forth today.
[CHORUS]
Hear the children cry 
as the King draws nigh, 
'tis the loving song,
From the loyal throng
to the blessed one
From his royal throne,
As he rides today,
in the palm-strewed way.

2. [sung with overlapping voices]
[Children]
Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna, hosanna, 
Our King rides forth today.
With palms adorn his way.
[CHORUS]
Hear the children cry 
as the King draws nigh, 
'tis the loving song,
From the loyal throng
to the blessed one
From his royal throne,
As he rides today,
in the palm-strewed way.

[sung with overlapping voices]
[Children]
Blessed is he, is he that cometh,
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[CHORUS]
Blessed is he that cometh,
Sing they all with one accord, hosanna,
Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of God the Lord.
