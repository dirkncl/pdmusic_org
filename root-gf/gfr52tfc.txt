1. 
The clock is on the stroke of six, 
The Father’s work is done, 
Sweep up the hearth and mend the fire, 
And give him welcome home.
Tho’ wild and cold the night wind blows 
Full well the pathway Father knows. 
He’s crossing o’er the fields apace, 
He’s stronger than the storm, 
He does not feel the cold, not he, 
His heart it is so warm, 
For Father’s heart is stout and true 
As ever human bosom knew. 
Stay do not close the shutters child, 
For far along the lane 
The little window looks and he 
can see it shining plain, 
I’ve heard him say he loves to mark 
The cheerful fire light through the dark.

2. 
And we’ll do all that Father likes, 
His wishes are so few, 
Would they were more then ev’ry hour, 
Some wish of his I knew, 
I’m sure it makes a happy day 
When I can please him any way, 
I know he’s coming by this sign 
That baby’s almost wild, 
See how he laughs and crows and stares 
Heav’n bless the merry child, 
His fa ther’s self in form and limb, 
And father’s heart is strong in him. 
Hark! hark I hear his quick foot steps 
He’s through the garden gate, 
Run little Nell and ope the door, 
And do not let him wait, 
Shout, baby, shout, and clap thy hands 
For Father on the threshold stands.
