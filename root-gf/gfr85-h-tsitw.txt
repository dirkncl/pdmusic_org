1. O thou, at whose divine command, 
Good seed is sown in every land, 
Thy Holy Spirit now impart, 
And for thy word prepare each heart.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Prepare, prepare Each heart, 
O blessed Lord, to hear, 
To hear and heed the lessons this day given 
From thy most holy word.

2. Not ’mid the thorns of worldly thought, 
Nor soon by passing plunderers caught, 
Nor lacking depth the root to feed, 
May we receive thy Spirit’s seed.

3. O may it, here thy sowers toil, 
Fall in a good and honest soil; 
And springing up from firmest root, 
Through patience bear abundant fruit.
