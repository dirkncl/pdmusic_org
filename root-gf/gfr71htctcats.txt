"Hear the Cry
That Comes Across the Sea!" (1871)
Rallying Song and Chorus.
Words and Music by
George Frederick Root

1.
Hear the cry that comes across the sea,
North and South and East and West;
Rally Freeland! France is calling thee;
'Tis thy friend distressed.
Who gave breath in friendly word,
Kindling freedom's spark?
Who held out the friendly hand
When our days were dark?

CHORUS
'Twas the land of noble Lafayette,
First to aid in our advance;
Yes, the land we never can forget,
Genial, glorious France!

2.
How the sword has smote beauteous brow;
Can we rest and let her bleed?
Answer, Freeland! shall we help her now?
Who gave breath in friendly word,
Kindling freedom's spark?
Who held out the friendly hand
When our days were dark?

(CHORUS)

3.
War's dead tramp has crushed across the way,
Want and ruin follow near;
Rouse thee, Freeland! shall thy [mut-cur ?] stay
While there's plenty here?
Say who spoke the friendly word,
Kindling freedom's spark?
Who held out the friendly hand
When our days were dark?

(CHORUS)
