1. He climbs the mountain side
With swift and daring feet;
Oh, little cares he for wind or tide,
For weariness, cold or heat;
Where dense the thicket grows,
Where strong the torrent flows,
’Tis ever the same, “All right! all right!”
He whistles as on he goes.

2. He hears the distant roar
Of prowling beasts of prey,
He laughingly mocks it o’er and o’er,
And frightens them all away;
So brave his fearless cry,
So strong, so loud, so high;
’Tis ever the same, “All right! all right!”
He whistles as far they fly.

3. And when the stars come out
To glad the brow of night;
Right merrily rings his gladsome shout
Far over the mountains height;
And when his march is done
And mountain heights are won;
’Tis ever the same “All right! all right!”
He whistles his welcome home.
