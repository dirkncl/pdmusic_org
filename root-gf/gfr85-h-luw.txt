1. Let us with a joyful mind
Praise the Lord for he is kind;
For his mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For his mercies shall endure, (shall endure,)
Ever faithful, ever sure, (ever sure,)
Ever faithful, ever faithful,
Ever faithful, ever sure,
Ever faithful, ever faithful,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

2. Let us sound his name abroad,
For of gods he is the God;
Who by wisdom did create,
Heaven's expanse and all its state.

3. All his creatures God doth feed,
His full hand supplies their need;
Let us sound the praises forth,
Of his majesty and worth.
