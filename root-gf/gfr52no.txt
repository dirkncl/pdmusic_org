1.
Would ye learn the bravest thing
That men can ever do?
Would ye be an uncrowned king,
Absolute and true?
Would ye seek to emulate
All we learn in story,
Of the moral, just, and great,
Rich in real glory?
Would you lose much bitter care
In your lot below?
Bravely speak out when and where
'Tis right to an-swer "No."

2.
Few have learned to speak this word,
When it should be spoken;
Resolution is deferred,
Vows to virtue - broken;
More of courage is required
This one word to say,
Than to stand where shots are fired,
In the battle fray;
Use it fit ly and ye'll see
Many a lot below,
May be schooled and nobly ruled
By power to utter "No."

3.
Learn to speak this little word -
In its proper place,
Let no timid doubt be heard
Clothed with sceptic grace;
Let thy lips without disguise
Bold-ly pour it out,
Though a thousand dulcet lies
Keep hovering about;
For, be sure our hearts would lose
Future years of woe,
If our courage would refuse
The present hour with "No."

4.
Ah! how many thorns we wreath,
To twine our brows around,
By not knowing when to breathe
This important sound;
Many a breast has rued the day
When it reckoned loss,
Of fruits upon the moral 'Nay,'
Than - flowers upon the "Yes;"
Many a sad repentent thought
Turns to 'long a-go,'
When a luckless fate was wrought,
By want of say-ing "No."
