"Starved in Prison" (1865)
Words and Music by George Frederick Root.

1.
Had they fallen in the battle,
With the old flag waving high,
We should mourn, but not in anguish,
For the soldier thus would die;
But the dear boys starv'd in prison,
Helpless, friendless and alone,
While the haughty rebel leaders
Heard unmov'd each dying groan.

CHORUS
Yes, they starved in pens, and prisons,
Helpless, friendless and alone!
And their woe can ne'er be spoken,
Nor their agony be known,

2.
Had they died in ward or sickroom,
Nursed with but a soldier's care,
We should grieve, but still be thankful
That a human heart was there--
But the dear boys starv'd in prison,
Helpless, friendless and alone,
While the heartless rebel leaders
Heard unmov'd each dying groan.

[Repeat CHORUS]

3.
Oh! the thought so sad comes o're us,
Is this hour of joy and pride,
That the hearts we loved so fondly
Might be beating by our side;
But the dear boys starv'd in prison,
Helpless, friendless and alone,
While the cruel rebel leaders
Heard unmov'd each dying groan.
