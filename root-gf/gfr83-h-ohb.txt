1.
When rose the temple on the sacred mountain,
Enriched with gems of Ophir's mines renowned,
The golden lilies wreathed the sacred fountain,
The colonades with lily-work were crowned.

CHORUS 1
Oh, how beautiful! (Oh! how beautiful!)
Oh, how beautiful the altar of our God!

2.
But rose a Teacher wiser and more beauteous
Than any prophet that the world had known;
He sought the humble, taught the meek and duteous,
In quiet valleys and on mountains lone.

CHORUS 2
Oh, how beautiful! (Oh! how beautiful!)
Oh, how beautiful the Teacher sent from God!

3.
He saw the lilies, wayside fountains lining,
By shadowy palms and spreading olive trees;
"E'en Solomon," he said, "in glory shining,
Was not arrayed in beauty such as these!"

CHORUS 3
Oh, how beautiful! (Oh! how beautiful!)
Oh, how beautiful the temple of our God!
