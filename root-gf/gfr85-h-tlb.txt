1.
Why ring the bells such a gladsome peal?
'Tis to welcome the Lord's birthday.
Why, at his feet, do we humbly kneel?
'Tis to pray on the Lord's birhday.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Happy, happy birhday!
Holy, holy birthday!
Sing, 'tis the Lord's birthday.
Happy, happy birhday!
Holy, holy birthday!
Sing, 'tis the Lord's birthday.

2.
What is the joy of this festive morn?
'Tis the joy of the Lord's birhday.
What is the love in our so warm?
'Tis the love of the Lord's bithday.

3.
What makes the blessing of giving more?
'Tis the gift of the Lord's birthday.
Why do our thoughts up to heaven soar?
'Tis the pow'r of the Lord's birthday.
