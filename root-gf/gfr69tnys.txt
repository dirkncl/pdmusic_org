1. Come, hearts in whose pulses the summer is warm,
Tho’ winter be drearily blowing,
We’ll greet with a carol the happy New Year,
Tonight, while the Old Year is going.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Toll, bells, for the year that has fled!
Tell sorrowful chimes at his bier!
Then sing for the New in a jubiant strain,
Ring, bells, for the happy New Year.

2. The Old Year was sad for his burdens of care,
The New will be truer and brighter;
The Old had its griefs for the gayest to bear,
The New Year will make them the lighter.

3. O, wonderful gifts has the happy New Year!
And smiles at his pressence are waking;
New joys for the lives that are lonely and drear,
And hopes for the hearts that are breaking.

4. And tho’ to some heart that is merry and light,
He comes with a message of sorrow;
We’ll laugh as we sing him a welcom tonight,
And trust to our Father the morrow.
