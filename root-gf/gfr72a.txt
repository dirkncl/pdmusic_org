"JOHNNY, or, The Little Cripple's Song" (1872)
From "The Hour of Praise"
Words and Music by George Frederick Root
<-====================================->
This song is designed to illustrate that wonderful resignation,
and even happiness, which is sometimes seen in those, who, in
ordinary eyes, have nothing to make life desirable. A pleasant
effect may be produced by having the Refrain (Johnny's part)
sung by a child, or young person, in an adjoining room, opening
or closing the door to make it near or more distant.
<-====================================->
1.
We passed poor Johnny's cabin,
The ev'ning sun was low,
And thro' the little window,
It sent its parting glow.
His patient eyes were resting
Upon the open door,
And while we listened sweetly came
This burden o'er and o'er.

REFRAIN
I love hime, oh, I love him,
My Savior near and dear,
For tho' he cares for countless worlds,
He's always with me here.
O Savior, blessed Savior,
My heart is filled with joy,
How can you stay, and love me so,
A little crippled boy.

2.
His old and well-worn Bible
Was beside his bed,
The golden hues of sunset
Were playing round his head.
A radiance more than earthly
Beamed from his features thin,
We paused to hear his song again,
Before we entered in.

(REFRAIN)

3.
But when we came to leave him,
And hold his slender hand,
We knew he had a comfort
We could not understand,
And as beneath the maple
We stopped again to hear,
There seemed a sound of angels in
The song so heavenly clear.

(REFRAIN)
