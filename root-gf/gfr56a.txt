Dedicated to Miss Abbie S. Woodman
"My Prairie Home" (1856)
Song & Chorus
by George Frederick Root

1.
O my heart is ever longing,
Longing for my prairie home,
Where bright the sunny hours of gladness
Ever on my childhood shone;
There amid its glorious beauty
Loving mem'ry folds her wing,
Resting where the heart's affections
Tenderly and fondly cling.

CHORUS
Far away the crystal river,
Far away the heather's bloom,
Far the loving friends of childhood,
Far, O far my prairie home.

2.
In that bright and happy dwelling,
Dearer far than homes of pride,
How many a treasur'd scene of gladness
'Ever in my heart abide;
There a father's nightly blessing
Fell like music on my ear,
And each grief and care was banished
By a gentle mother's tear.

(CHORUS)

3.
Brother, true and noble hearted,
Darling sister fair and kind,
Dear friends that gather by the hearthstone,
Round you all my love is twined;
O do not forget my dear ones
While so far away I roam,
For my heart is ever longing,
Longing for my prairie home.

(CHORUS)
