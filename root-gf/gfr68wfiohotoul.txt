1.
We'll rally again, to the standard we bore
O'er battle fields crimson and gory,
Shouting "Hail to the Chief" who in Freedom's fierce war,
Hath covered that banner with glory.

CHORUS
Then rally again, then rally again,
With the Soldier and Sailor and Bummer,
And we'll fight it out here, on the old Union line,
No odds if it takes us all summer.

2.
We'll rally again, by the side of the men
Who breasted the conflicts fierce rattle,
And they'll find us still true, who were true to them then,
And bade them "God speed" in the battle.

(CHORUS)

3.
We'll rally again, and that "Flag of the Free,"
Shall stay where our heroes have placed it,
And ne'er shall they govern, on land or on sea,
Whose treason hath spurned and disgraced it.

(CHORUS)

4.
We'll rally again, and our motto shall be,
What ever the nation that bore us,
God bless that old banner, "The Flag of the Free,"
And all who would die with it o'er us!

(CHORUS)
