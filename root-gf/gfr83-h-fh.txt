1.
Father, hear our supplication,
  While Thy children to Thee pray,
That Thou keep us from temptation,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
All (All this) this (holy) day,
All (All this) this (holy) day.

2.
Let us not in selfish pleasure
  Pass the precious hours away,
Laying up but earthly treasures,

3.
While in ignorance and blindness
  Grope we on our devious way,
Watch our feet with loving kindness,

4.
So, when night's calm shades are stealing
  O'er the earth; grant each hour may
In Thy pure sight bear revealing,
