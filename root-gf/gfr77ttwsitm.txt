1.
Oh, we must be ready by night,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning,
We must work while 'tis call-ed the light,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning.

CHORUS
Oh, the glory shines up there,
Ev'ry hill and vale adorning,
Then press right on with all your might
For the trumpet will sound in the morning.

2.
Be sure that your armor is strong,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning,
Never mind tho' the battle be long,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning.

(CHORUS)

3.
Yes, on till we draw the last breath,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning,
Even sing at the river of death,
For the trumpet will sound in the morning.

(CHORUS)
