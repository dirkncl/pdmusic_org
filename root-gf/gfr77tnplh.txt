1.
When wand'ring o'er the deep,
The sailor turns him home,
How earnestly he longs
For that sweet hour to come,
When he again shall see
The dearest earthly spot,
Where friends and loved ones true,
He knows forget him not,
Where friends and loved ones true,
He knows forget him
not. (Home, home, sweet, sweet home.)
Dear (There's) home (no),
loved (place like) home.
There's no place like home,
Dear (There's) home (no),
loved (place like) home.
There's no place like home.

2.
When worn with care and toil,
The soldier marches on.
How bounds his heart with joy,
If turning to his home.
So we, with spirits light,
Our labor being done,
Unite in cheerful song
As we're returning home,
Unite in cheerful song
As we're returning 
home.  (Home, home, sweet, sweet home.)
Dear (There's) home (no),
loved (place like) home.
There's no place like home,
Dear (There's) home (no),
loved (place like) home.
There's no place like home.
