1. 
SOLO
Softly she faded, 
As fades the twilight, 
Sweetly she murmured, 
“Dear friends, adieu!”
“There is no shadow,
All, all is peaceful,
Bright o’er the river,
Heaven is in view,”
So ’twas she faded,
As fades the twilight,
So ’twas she murmured, 
“Dear friends, adieu!” 

CHORUS [overlapping with each VERSE}
Hm ... [thru-out]

2. 
SOLO
Gently beside her
Sad tears were falling,
Softly around her
Strong arms were thrown,
Fondly she whispered,
“Weep not for me,
My Saviour is here,
And I’m going home.”
So ’twas she faded,
As fades the twilight,
So ’twas she murmured,
“I’m going home.”
