"The Honeysuckle Glen" (1855)
by George Frederick Root
[from "Six Songs by Wurzel: Geo. F. Root" (No. 2)]

1.
In the honeysuckle glen, where odors sweet
Perfume the breeze that floats along,
And the rosy tints of morn with blushes greet
The lark, as she trills her song;
In the honeysuckle glen how pleasantly
The happy summer days would glide,
When I wandered by the rill so merrily,
And Lila by her side.

CHORUS
Lila, Lila, wake again
From thy sleep in the honeysuckle glen,
Lila, dearest, all is o'er,
Thou wilt return no more.

2.
In the honeysuckle glen, secluded far,
The home of nature's fairest bowers,
When with mild and gentle light the evening star
Looks forth on the dewey flowers;
In the honeysuckle glen how tenderly
I looked upon my tender bride,
And I never dreamed that care could reach me there,
When Lila was by by side.

(CHORUS)

3.
Thro' the honeysuckle glen, I've wandered now,
For many weary years alone,
Oh! I never more shall see her angel brow,
Or list to her winning tone,
But the parting words she spoke I'll cherish still,
And wear them on my breaking heart,
'Till I meet her on that shore, our sorrows o'er,
Where loved ones no more shall part.

(CHORUS)
