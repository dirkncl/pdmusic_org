Both young men and maidens, praise Him! 
Old men and chldren 
Old men and children praise Him! praise Him!

For the Lord is good, His mercy is everlasting. 
His truth endureth to all generations. 
And His truth endureth to all generations.
Let everything that hath breath,

[CHOIR and CONGREGATION]
1. From all that dwell below the skies, 
Let the Creator’s praise arise; 
Let the Redeemer’s name be sung, 
Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue. 

2. Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord, 
Eternal truth attends Thy word! 
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
Till sun shall rise and set no more.
