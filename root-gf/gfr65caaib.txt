1. 
Comrade! all around is brightness, 
Deck’d with beauty all doth seem; 
Am I dying comrade dying? 
Or of heaven do I dream? 
Tell me truly, am I wounded? 
For I cannot feel the pain; 
Have I in the battle fallen? 
Am I lying with the slain?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Comrade, all around is brightness, 
Heav’n’s bright rays upon me beam; 
All around is joy and gladness, 
Deck’d with beauty all doth seem.

2. 
Comrade! now I see an angel
Bearing downward from the sky;
Do you hear it softly singing?
Oh how sweet it is to die!
Comrade, see, it is my mother!
On her brow a crown doth gleam,
She is coming now to guide me
Through yon blue and starry stream.

3. 
Comrade! well do I remember
When my darling Mother died;
Said she in her parting blessing,
“I shall e’er be by thy side;”
And she twined her arms around me,
Gently kissed my childish brow.
Said she, “we shall meet in heaven.
Farewell I am going now.”

4. 
Comrade! when the conflict rages,
May good angels with thee dwell;
Take a dying soldier’s blessing.
Comrade, comrade, fare thee well!
For the heav’nly ones are waiting.
Do you hear them sweetly sing?
Oh I may not, would not linger.
Into life my soul doth spring.
