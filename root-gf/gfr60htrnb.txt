1. SOLO BASS
Hear the rough November blast, 
As it roars along, 
How the hills and valleys ring 
With the wild old song! 
’Mid the treetop’s trembling arms 
How it hurls its fierce alarms! 
Ever beck’ning on the storms of the wintertime, 
Ever beck’ning on the storms of the wintertime.

[CHORUS (SAT) with overlapping voice with VERSE]
1. The blast roars, roars along, 
They ring, wild, wild, old song, 
their arms, alarms, the storms, 
Yes! yes! the storms, 
Yes! yes! of wintertime.

2. SOLO BASS
’Tis the sound so cold and drear 
Of the Frost-king’s voice, 
’Mid the mountain caverns deep 
How the tones rejoice! 
’Mid the treetop’s trembling arms 
How he hurls his fierce alarms! 
Ever beck’ning on the storms of the wintertime, 
Ever beck’ning on the storms of the wintertime.

[CHORUS (SAT) with overlapping voice with VERSE]
2. How drear, how drear the voice, 
So deep, how they rejoice, 
their arms, alarms, the storms, 
Yes! yes! the storms, 
Yes! yes! of wintertime.
