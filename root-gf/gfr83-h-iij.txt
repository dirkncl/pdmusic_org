1.
In early morn when I awake,
Who then appears to me
More wonderfully beautiful,
Than all things else I see?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
It is Jesus, it is Jesus,
The Saviour of the world.

2.
Whom do I see to Calvary's brow,
His heavenly burden bear,
And 'neath its weight in sorrow bow,
While weep his fol'wers there?

3.
Whom do I see to heaven rise
In holy light arrayed,
To lift forever sorrowing eyes,
Above death's gloomy shade?

4.
When death my strength of faith shall prove,
And earthly care shall cease;
Who'll bear me on His breast of love
To endless joy and peace?
