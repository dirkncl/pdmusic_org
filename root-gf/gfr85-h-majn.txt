Make a joyful noise unto God,
Make a joyful noise all ye lands,
Sing forth the honor of his name, the honor of His name,
All the earth shall worship Thee,
All the earth shall sing unto Thee.
They shall sing (They shall sing,)
to Thy name, (They shall sing,)
They shall sing unto Thy name,
Make a joyful noise unto God,
Make a joyful noise all ye lands,
Sing forth the honor of his name, the honor of His name.
