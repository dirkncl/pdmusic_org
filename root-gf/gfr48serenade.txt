1.
List while I sing to thee,
  fairest and best,
Chase thy sweet slumbers,
  Awake from thy rest;
Hear the sweet melodies
  floating afar,
Breathed from the strings of
  my tuneful Guitar.

2.
Steal from thy pillow,
  Thy casement unclose;
Lift the light curtain
  That veils thy repose--
Softly the moonbeam
  Its mantle will throw,
O'er thy fair tresses
  And ivory brow.

3.
Part but one bud
  From the jessamine spray,
From in thy bosom,
  Then toss it away--
Swift through the lattice,
  Kind Zephyr will bring
Love's fairy token
  To bless while I sing.
