1. How straight the path appears, 
How open and how fair; 
In wisdom’s ways of pleasantness 
No fell destroyers are.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come, join, (Come, join,)  come, join, (come, join,)
To swell the happy throng, (happy throng,) 
Ye pilgrims in Jehovah’s ways, 
With music pass along. 

2. See flowers of paradise 
In rich profusion spring, 
The sun of glory gilds the path, 
And dear companions sing.

3. All honor to his name, 
Who marks the shining way; 
To him who leads the wand’rer on 
To realms of endless day.
