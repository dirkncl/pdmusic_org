1.
Now rejoicing! Now rejoicing!
Hearts to heav'n and voices raise;
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise.
He who on the cross a victim
For the world's salvation bled,
Jesus Christ the King of glory,
Now is risen from the dead.

2.
Christ is risen, Christ the first-fruits
Of the holy harvest field,
Which will all its free abundance
At his glorious coming yield:
Then the golden ears of harvest
Will their heads before him wave,
Ripened by his glorious sunshine,
From the furrows of the grave.

3.
Christ is risin! Christ is risen!
Shed upon us heavenly grace.
Rain, and dew, and gleams of glory
From the brightness of thy face,
That we, with our hearts in heaven,
Here on earth may fruitful be,
And by angel-hands be gathered,
And be ever, Lord, with thee.

CODA, after last verse.
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!
