To my old and valued Friend
Mr. J. M. Cambell
of Wesley's Minstrels.
"That Little Church Around the Corner" (1871)
by George Frederick Root

1.
When blessings fall from the Hand divine,
And mercies meet the mourner,
When praises ring, and honors crown,
When good deeds bring their treasures down,
May all, and more, be found upon
"That little church around the corner."

CHORUS
That little church around the corner,
That little church around the corner,
All honor give while good deeds live,
To that little church around the corner.

2.
The old man falls, and the good friend goes
To meet almost a scorner;
'Tis not our way, 'twould be a sin,
We don't approve what he has been.
Your only chance I think is in
"That little church around the corner."

(CHORUS)

3.
How sometimes sorrow will turn to joy.
In hearts that long have bourne her,
How here, the lone and Fatherless,
From trial more, and deep distress,
Have learned to love, revere and bless,
"That little church around the corner."

(CHORUS)
