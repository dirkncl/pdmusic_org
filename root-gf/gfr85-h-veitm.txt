1.
Very early in the morn
Came the Marys weeping,
Bringing spices rare and sweet,
Hast'ning on with loving feet
Where the Lord was sleeping.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
He is not here, the Loved One dear,
Not here, for he is risen!
Broke the seal and passed away
From the silent prison.

2.
Very early in the morn
Joyful tidings giving,
Two in shining garments said:
"Seek him not among the dead,
But among the living."

3.
Very early in the morn
Sad, our loved ones seeking,--
Love's sweet incense when we bring,
May the shining angels sing,
To our spirits speaking.
