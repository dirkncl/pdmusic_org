"The Shining Shore" (1855)
Words by Reverend David Nelson
Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
My days are gliding swiftly by,
  And I, a pilgrim stranger,
Would not detain as they fly,
  Those hours of toil and danger.

CHORUS
For oh, we stand on Jordan's strand,
  Our friends are passing over;
And just before the Shining Shore
  We may almost discover.

2.
We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
  Our heav'nly home discerning;
Our absent Lord has left us word,
  Let ev'ry lamp be burning.

3.
Should coming days be cold and dark,
  We need not cease our singing;
That perfect rest naught can molest,
  Where golden harps are ringing.

(CHORUS)

4.
Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow,
  Each chord on earth to sever;
Our King says, Come, and there's our home,
  Forever, oh, forever.

(CHORUS)
