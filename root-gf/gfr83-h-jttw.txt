1. Joy to the world! the Lord is come; 
The mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace. 
Let every heart prepare him room, 
The mighty God, the Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace. 

2. Joy to the world! the Savior reigns; 
The mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace. 
O praise hi, floods, rocks, hills and plains, 
The mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace. 

3. He rules the world with truth and grace, 
The mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace. 
And saves us by his righteousness, 
The mighty God, the 
Everlasting Father and the 
Prince of Peace.
