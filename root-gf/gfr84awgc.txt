_Not the choice._

1. His brain is dazed, his eyes are bleared,
His nose is fiery red,
His haggard face with grime is smeared,
And wears a look of dread.
His voice is tremulous and weak,
His limbs no power own,
And like a palsied human wreck
He staggers on alone.

CHORUS 1. & 2.
He’s not the choice for me,
He’s not the choice for me,
The dread name there is ALCOHOL!
He’s not the choice for me,

2. He has no friends, he has no home,
Nor place to lay his head;
No ray of joy to him can come,
His heart is cold as lead.
A little while and he must fall—
Look on his brow and see
The dread name stamped there— ALCOHOL!
He’s not the choise for me!

_The choice._

3. His brain is clear, his eyes are bright,
His cheeks are rosy red,
His breath is sweet, his step is light,
No debt hangs o’er his head.
His voice is musical and soft,
His limbs are lithe and strong,
He holds his head erect, and oft
He carols forth a song.

CHORUS 3. & 4. 
Oh! he’s the choice for me!
Oh! he’s the choice for me,
His name is TEMPERANCE, cool and calm,
And he’s the choice for me.

4. He needs no doctor— has no ills—
No lawyers trouble him—
He labors hard and pays his bills,
He fears no landlord grim.
His are the qualities to charm—
No slave to passion he—
His name is TEMPERANCE cool and calm,
And he’s the choice for me.
