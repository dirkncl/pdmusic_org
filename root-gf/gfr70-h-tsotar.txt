1. Oh, we are the reapers that garner in
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin;
With sickles of truth must the work be done,
And no one may rest till the “harvest home.” 1.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We are the reapers! Oh, who will come
And share in the glory of the “harvest home?”
Oh, who will help us to garner in
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?

2. Go out in the byways and search them all;
The wheat may be there, though the woods are tall;
Then search in the highway, and pass none by
But gather from all for the home on high.

3. The fields all are rip’ning, and far and wide
The word now is waiting the harvest tide;
But the reapers are few, and the work is great,
And much will be lost should the harvest wait.

4. So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,
And gather together the golden grain.
Toil on to the sheaves of the Lord are bound
And joyfully borne from the harvest ground.
