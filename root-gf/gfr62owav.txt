"O, We Are Volunteers" (12 Jun 1862)
(The "Silver Chime" Army Song)
[the words & music are unacredited,
so are assumed to be by
George Frederick Root, 1820-1895]

[scored for unaccompanied SA+B voices]
1. O, we are volunteers in the army of the Lord,
Forming into line at my Captain's word;
We are under marching orders to take the battle field,
And we'll never give o'er the fight till the foe shall yield.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Come and join the army, the army of the Lord,
Jesus is our Captain, we rally at his words;
Sharp will be the conflict with the pow'rs of sin,
But with such a Leader, we are sure to win.

2. The glory of the our flag is the emblem of the dove,
Gleaming are our swords from the forge of love;
We go forth, but not to battle for earthly honors vain,
'Tis a bright immortal crown that we seek to gain.

3. Our foes are in the field, pressing hard on ev'ry side,
Envy, anger, hatred, with self and pride;
They are cruel, fierce and strong, ever ready to attack,
We must watch and fight and pray, if we'd drive them back.

4. O, glorious is the struggle in which we draw the sword,
Glorious is the Kingdom of Christ, our Lord;
It shall spread from sea to sea, it shall reach from shore to shore,
And his people shall be blessed for evermore.
