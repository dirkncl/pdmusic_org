1. Each one has a mission, some work to do;
O, the last fruition, if we are true,
Bright shall be the pathway, hearts full of joy,
If working for the Master be our employ.

2. Little deeds of kindness, sweet words of love,
Helping on each other to Heaven above,
Smiling on the weary, aiding the weak;
All these are little missions our hearts may seek.

3. We can love each other with youthful zest,
We can love the Savior, dearest and best;
O, the work is plenty children may do,
Then let us all be earnest, faithful and true.
