"On the Threshold" (1876)
Words by J. T. Lockwood
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
On the threshold lo! there standeth
  One whose voice we've heard before,
And He patiently demandeth
  Entrance at the closed door.
    "Guilty sinners, let me in,
    I have come to cleanse your sin."

2.
Hark! how tenderly He's pleading
  "I am standing at the door."
Whilst the sinner still unheeding
  Keeps it barr'd as here-to-fore.
    But the accepted kingly hand
    Still and entrance doth demand.

3.
'Tis the Saviour, long rejected,
  Wakes the echoes of the heart.
'Tis his voice, so long neglected,
  Bids our evil guest depart;
    And Himself our guest would stay,
    Keeping evil foes away.

4.
O! behold His smile so peaceful
  Wounded hands, and feet, and brow;
By His wounds freed sin released,
  We may hail Him Saviour now.
    Coming, He would give us rest,
    All by Him so long unblest.

5.
Come Thou in, no longer standing,
  Knocking at our heedless heart;
Come, and all our soul commanding,
  Never more from thence depart.
    Be our guest, and be our Lord,
    Crown, and joy, and great reward.
