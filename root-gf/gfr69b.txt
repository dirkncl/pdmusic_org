1.
I am for one, and there's one for me,
Somewhere, somewhere,
Whisper ye breezes of land and sea,
And tell him I love him, where e'er he be,
O, tell him, I'm waiting for him alone,
Somewhere, somewhere,
Waiting and longing my king to own,
From over the distant sea.
What tho' our pathways may farther go,
Somewhere, somewhere,
Still at the last we shall meet, I know
And nevermore parted be.
Yes, he is coming for me alone,
Somewhere, somewhere,
And I am longing my king to own,
From over the silent sea.

2.
I am for one, and there's one for me,
Somewhere, somewhere,
Maybe, his face I shall never see,
Till, "over the river" will wander free,
But there for his coming my heart shall wait,
Somewhere, somewhere,
E'n to the steps of the pearly gate
Far over the mystic sea.
He will be faithful, and so shall I,
Somewhere, somewhere,
Hope will grow brighter, as time flies by,
For he will come home to me.
Yes, he is coming for me alone,
Somewhere, somewhere,
And I am longing my king to own,
From over the mystic sea.
