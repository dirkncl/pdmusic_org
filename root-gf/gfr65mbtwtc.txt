1. 
Not long ago I had a beau, 
I’ll tell you all I know about him. 
I’ve got none now and I know how 
To get along as well without him. 
I used to think to hear him talk, 
That not a man on earth was braver. 
But when the drums began to beat, 
He very suddenly grew graver.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O Jimmy dear you need not fear, 
That we shall grieve about you. 
The war is done, the boys have come, 
And we can do without you.

2. 
He used to talk before the war,
Of deeds of fame, renown & glory.
But when he heard the cannon’s roar,
He did not like the martial story.
He had no taste for scenes of strife.
He proved himself a first rate quaker,
And when they talked about a draft,
He found himself a very shaker.

3. 
He said that he was fortysix,
Or else that he was only twenty.
But Uncle Samuel knew the tricks
Of all such youths and they were plenty.
So Uncle Sam he gave a wink,
That shook my Jimmy to the centre,
And soon as he began to think
He started farther north in stanter.

4. 
Somewhere across the line today,
Perhaps of me this youth is thinking.
If this is so, I only say,
That Uncle Sam is still awinking.
And should he backward sneak again,
At sneaking he has proved so handy,
We’ll give the child what he deserves,
Something that's not so good as Can’da!
