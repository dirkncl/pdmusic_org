1.
Now while we gather round the altar,
May ev'ry heart be filled with gladness and praise,
No tongue be silent, no accents falter,
While to redeeming love our voices we raise.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, how he loved us--this blessed Savior!
Think that to save us he came down to die!
Come, let us serve hi, and in his favor
Find new delight on earth and glory on high.

2.
Once more our praises to him who taught us
When we were wand'ring far away from his love;
Sing of the ransom with which he bought us,
And of the heavenly mansions waiting above.

3.
All we can offer for his protection
Will be as naught compared with his loving care;
Yet we may bring him our best affection,
And in his cause and kingdom our portion bear.
