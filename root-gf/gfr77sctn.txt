"Slowly Comes the Night" (1877)
Words and Music
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
(from page 26 of "The New Song Era")

1.
Slowly comes the night,
With shadows dark and deep,
While sounds of life, and busy daylight,
All are hushed in sleep.

2.
Noiseless is his tread.
Tho' earth his presence feels
Withing his silent arms enfolded,
Peace each eyelid seals.

3.
Softly, softly sing,
Disturbing cares, begone.
Oh, may good angels watch around us
'Till the morning's dawn.
