1.
Smiling little river river,
From my window seen,
Gliding on so gently,
Through the meadows green,
Cheering and refreshing
All upon thy way;
Brightly glow thy waters
At the close of day.

2.
May our lives be like thee,
Gentle little stream,
Sending all around us,
Love's celestial beam;
Cheering still and blessing
All upon our way;
Brightest at the closing
Of our earthly day.
