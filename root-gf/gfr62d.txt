On Rememberance of Gettysburg
"Within the Sound of the Enemy's Guns" (1862)
A Descriptive Song
Words by Reverend T. Newton Jones
Music George Frederick Root

1.
Within the sound of the enemy's guns,
Within their sound are we;
A gallant band of patriot sons,
Fighting the battles of Liberty,
Beneath the folds of the "Flag of the Free" ...
Boom ... Boom ... Now now ye Northern sons
Rouse, Rouse... at the sounds of the enemy's guns.

2.
Within the sound of the enemy's guns,
Within their range are we;
The Parrott shell thro' the hot air hums,
The Minnie show'r from the thicket comes,
Stand firm! stand firm ye ranks of the free.
Boom! Boom! Now, now Columbia's sons,
Charge! Charge! And take the enemy's guns;
Yes, Charge! Charge! And take the enemy's guns.

3.
All silenc'd the roar of the enemy's guns
All silenc'd their lips have we.
Awake the roll of the battle drums
Raise high the cheer that surging comes
In the hour ... in the hour of victory.
Boom! Boom! Now, now, O galant ones,
Sieze! Sieze, for your trophies the enemy's guns.
Yes, Sieze! Sieze, for your trophies the enemy's guns.
