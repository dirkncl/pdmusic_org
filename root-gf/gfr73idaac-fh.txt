1. I dreamt an angel came, mama,
And oh, so bright did seem,
Arrayed in robes of white, mama,
Oh, what a lovely dream;
It seemed to hover o’er my bed
Till near the dawn of day,
And then with golden wings so bright,
It softly flew away.

CHORUS [with overlapping voices;
sung after each VERSE]
She dreamt [An angel came,]
She dreamt [An angel came,]
To hearts as pure and faith as sure,
They’ll ever come, the same,
[Sung after last CHORUS]
They’ll ever come, the same.

2. I dreamt it smoothed my brow, mama,
And sweetly spoke my name,
And said if I were good, mama,
’Twould surely come again;
Its presence seemed to bring to me
A holy, pure delight,
What pleasure it would be to have
Such bright dreams ev’ry night.

3. Oh, what a happy land, mama,
Their dwelling place must be,
If all are like the one, mama,
That came in dreams to me;
How sweet to think their presence will
All thoughts of sin destroy,
To think that in their home there’s naught
But happiness and joy.
