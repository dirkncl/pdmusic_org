1.
Come nearer, nearer to the cross
And bid this world of care begone;
Come follow Jesus closer still,
'Tis better farther on.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
'Tis better, better ev-ery day,
'Tis growing brighter all the way, [all the way,]
And to its fulness we shall come
When we arrive at home.

2.
Come Zion's mourner, dry your tears
And tune your heart to sweetest song;
The night of grief will soon be past,
'Tis better farther on.

3.
Come trembling soul, gird on the strength
Which God supplies through Christ His Son;
Cast off your doubts and humbly trust,
'Tis better farther on.
