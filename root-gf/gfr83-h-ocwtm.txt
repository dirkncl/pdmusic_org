1. 
Oh come while the morn is breaking o’er thee, 
Oh come while the midnight shadows flee; 
Oh come while the skies are tinged with glory, 
A promise of peace hung out for thee. 
Arise then, arise! the light breaks o’er thee, 
Oh stretch forth thy hands toward the throne; 
Thy true home is in the world of glory, 
Where Jesus thy Saviour reigns alone.

2. 
Arise! see the heavenly day is o’er thee 
More radiant than summer’s noontide ray; 
The bright starry crowns and realms of glory 
Say come, come each happy soul away. 
Away, yes, away! leave sin and sadness, 
Oh stretch forthe thy hands toward the throne; 
Thy home is that blessed world of gladness, 
Where Jesus thy Savious reigns alone.
