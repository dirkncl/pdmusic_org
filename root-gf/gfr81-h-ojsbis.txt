"On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand" (1881?)
Words by Samuel Stennett, 1727-1795
Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
[VARINA, C.M.D.]

1.
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possesions lie.
O the transporting, rapturous scene
That rises to my sight;
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight!

2.
O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day,
There God the Son for ever reigns,
And scatters night away.
No chilling winds, or poisonous breath,
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
Are felt and feared no more.

3.
When I shall reach that happy place,
I'll be forever blest,
For I shall see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest.
Filled with delight my raptured soul
Lives out its earthly day,
And thenm though Jordon's waves may roll,
I'll fearless launch away. A-men.

Root to fit the same music.

"There Is a Land of Pure Delight" (1881?)
Words by Isaac Watts, 1674-1748
Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
[VARINA, C.M.D.]

1.
There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never withering flowers;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heavenly land from ours.

2.
Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.
Could we but climb where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o're,
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
Should fright us from the shore. A-men.
