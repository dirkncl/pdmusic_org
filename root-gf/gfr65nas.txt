[1861]
1. [North]
Ah wherefore wouldst thou leave our band? 
Why turn ye from our union, 
Why wander from the happy land 
Long joined in close communion? 
My sister pause! O canst thou go, 
Canst leave the cause we’ve loved together, 
The bond our fathers did bestow? 
O canst thou break it and forever? 
The bond our fathers did bestow? 
O canst thou break it, 
canst thou break it and for ever? 

2. [South] 
Why should I pause ah wherefore stay? 
The tie is broken now 
We will not brook thy northern sway, 
Will not to tyrants bow, 
Nay urge me not for well you know, 
Our progress you’ve retarded. 
We start anew, we from you go. 
Our rights you’ve disregarded. 

3. [North]
My darkeyed sister say not so. 
This erring step will lead to woe. 

4. 
’Twill lead to peace, 
’Twill give new life, 
Th’o bought by sorrow, war and strife.

INTERLUDE
[Observe that the Interlude is played between
the 4th and 5th verses. It might be well for
the singers to be seated during its performance.]
[Hoisting of the old Flag.]
[Rallying to the Standard.]
[Battle impending.]
[Through disaster & defeat, still marching on.]
[The fiery ordeal passed.]
[Victory.]
[The Rescue.]
[Home again.]

[1865]
5. [North]
Thrice welcome to our band once more. 
Come join our blessed reunion. 
Our trals now are haply o’er. 
We meet in sweet communion. 
O sister come, how oft we’ve prayed 
The hour might be when we together, 
Should see our banner once more waved, 
O’er all our country free for ever, 
Should see our banner once more waved, 
O’er all our country, 
all our country free for ever. 

6. [South]
I come again yet wherefore now, 
For oh I’ve wandered long 
My head in shame I fain would bow, 
Canst thou forgive the wrong, 
The dear old flag I love it yet, 
Why was I so demented. 
I come again thou wilt forget. 
For see, I have repented.

7. [North]
We mourned thy loss we will forget. 
Our banner shall protect thee yet. 

8. 
Tis waving still, 
Each starry fold, 
By far more precious than of old.

FINALE
9. [North & South]
United now once more we stand, 
As sisters should a loving band. 
The North & South with East & West, 
In one great Union sweetly blest, 
Each fancied wrong, each hasty word, 
Each unkind thought within us stirred, 
Shall now and aye forgotten be, 
Throughout our land so great and free, 
Shall now and aye forgotten be, 
Thoughout our land so great and free.
