1.
The whirlwind! the whirlwind! a monarch is he;
And he sways a wide region--the land and the sea;
And who is so dauntless that bends not in fear
When he passes along in his mighty career?
  When he passes along in his mighty career?

2.
The soft winds that nourish the blossoms and flow'rs
Flee away from the forest, the fields and the bow'rs;
To caverns of the stillness in terror they hie,
For they know that the king of the tempest is nigh,
  For they know that the king of the tempest is nigh.

3.
He comes on his chariot--the grand, lofty cloud;
And the voice of his coming is haughty and loud;
He vaunteth his strength, and he shouts in his glee,
That no spirit of storm is so mighty as he,
  That no spirit of storm is so mighty as he.
