1.
Safely thor' another week,
God has brought us on our way,
Let us now a blessing seek,
Waiting in his courts today,
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest.

2.
While we seek supplies of grace,
In our dear Redeemer's name,
Show thy reconciling face,
Take away our sin and shame,
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in thee.

3.
Here we come, they name to praise,
Let us feel thy presence near,
May thy glory meet our eyes,
While we in thy courts appear,
Here afford us, Lord, a taste
Of our everlasting rest.
