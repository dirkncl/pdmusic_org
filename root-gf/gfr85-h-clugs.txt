1.
Come, let us gladly sing
To God our Savior-King;
With thanks his presence seek,
In psalms his praises speak
To God most high; let us all dray nigh
And crown him Lord of earth and sky.

2.
He gave the mountains birth,
He made the spacious earth;
His all the sea and land--
They rose at his command.
With rev'rence all before him fall,
And on his name devoutly call.

3.
Come, kneel before his throne,
For he is God alone;
We are the flock he leads--
The sheep his bounty feeds;
Today, today, his voice obey,
Grieve not the Holy Ghost away.
