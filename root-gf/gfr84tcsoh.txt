[Due to so much overlapping of voices, the following
is just a paraphrase of the lyrics]

[Alto recitative]
And all the Angles fell before the throne 
on their faces and worshipped God, saying, 
[CHORUS]
Amen, Amen, 
Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
and honor and power, and might be unto our God 
forever and ever, Amen, Amen. 
[QUARTET]
Hark! how the Choral song of heav’n, 
Swells full of peace and joy above, 
Hark! how they strike their heav’n, 
Swells full of peace and joy above, 
Hark! how they strike their golden harps 
And raise the tuneful notes of love,
[CHORUS]
Blessing  and glory, and wisdom and thanksgiving 
and honor, and honor and power and might, 
be unto our God forever and ever Amen. Amen. 
[CHOURS and QUARTET]
When shall we join the heav’nly host, 
Who sing Immanuel’s praise on high, 
And leave behind our doubts and fears, 
To swell the chorus of the sky, 
To swell the chorus of the sky, the chorus of the sky,
To swell the chorus of the sky, 
Hallelujah, Hallejujah, forevermore, Amen, Amen.
