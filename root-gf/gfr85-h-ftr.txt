1.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
In the army of the Lord,
Gather in from every land and every tongue.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
And with songs of sweet accord
Make the triumphs of your great Redeemer known.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Let the joyful shout of the army ring,
With the cross before your eyes.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
For your Savior and your King.
And the crown of glory waiting in the skies.

2.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
We are on the battleground,
And our foes are near at hand on every side.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
While the silver trumpets sound,
And our banners float in beauty far and wide.

3.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
Do not tremble, faint nor fall,
For in Jesus we shall conquer every foe.
Fill the ranks! fill the ranks!
Trust in him - our all in all,
Till from conflict on to vict'ry we shall go.
