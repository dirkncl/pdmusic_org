1. God with us! oh, glorious name! 
Let it shine in endless fame; 
God and man in Christ unite, 
Oh mysterious depth and height. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
God with us! God with us! 
Oh, mysterious depth and height! 
God with us! God with us! 
God and man in Christ uunite.

2. God with us! outshouted not 
With the first transgressor's blot; 
Yet he did our sins sustain, 
Bear the curse, the grief, the pain. 

3. God with us! oh, wondrous grace! 
Let us see him face to face; 
That we may Immanuel sing, 
Our Redeemer, God and King.
