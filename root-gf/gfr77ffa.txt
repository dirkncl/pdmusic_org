1. Friends and old companions dear,
Tho’ far, far away,
In our dreams you oft appear,
Tho’ far, far away.

2. Think not we can e’er forget,
Tho’ far, far away,
Those sweet hour when first we met,
Tho’ far, far away.

3. Time steals on, and you remain
Still far, far away;
But we hope to meet again,
Tho’ far, far away.
