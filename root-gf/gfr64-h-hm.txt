1. I see in heav’n those mansions bright,
  The noonday sun outshining,
For those who feel the Saviour’s love
  Around their hearts entwining.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! happy they who reach that place
  Where sorrow cometh never;
Who rest within His loving arms
  Forever and forever.

2. If I could hear my Saviour say,—
  “Thy sins are all forgiven,”
Then I could see a shining house,
  Waiting for me in heaven.

3. Look! how the children at his feet
  Their tiny crowns are flinging;
While angels, on their downy wings,
  The latest born are bringing.

4. Yes! I will love my Saviour now,
  And serve Him in life’s morning;
For I can see the house, on high,
  Of His own hands adorning.
