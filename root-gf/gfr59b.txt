"Dreaming Ever Dreaming" (1859)
by George Frederick Root

1.
Dreaming ever dreaming
Dearest one of thee.
O the glorious waking
When thy form I see.
O the glorious waking
When thou greetest me.
When thoughts called to wander,
Far from home sweet home.
Though to all a stranger,
Still I'm ne'er lone.
For I'm ever dreaming,
Dearest one of thee,
Hoping for the waking
When thy form I see.
For the glorious waking
When (though greetest/with) me.

2.
Dearer still and dearer
Every olden tie.
Closer still and closer
Mem'ry brings them nigh
Stronger still and stronger
As the time goes by.
But should all forsake me
Home and friends be gone,
This should not awake me
Still I'd slumber on.
For I would be dreaming
Dearest one of thee
And my only waking
When thou greetest me
And my only waking
When (though greetest/with) me.
