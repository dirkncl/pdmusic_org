[Single voice or Semi-chorus]
1. Jesus, Savior, I am helpless,
But my faith looks up to thee,
Humbly trusting in thy mercy,
Thy dear name is all my plea.

[Chorus Interlude, promptly and softly.]
In thy loving favor
May my soul abide,
Let thy goodness ever,
Keep me near thy side.

2. Jesus, Savior, in thy mercy,
Hold me, lest my feet should stray,
Guide me by thy holy counsel,
In the straight and narrow way.

3. Jesus, Sov'reign, Mighty Ruler,
Take possession of my heart,
Rule till in thy better kingdom,
I from thee shall never part.
