"One Step More" (1874)
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
It may be that my path is rough,
And long, and hard and steep,
An knowing this my strength might fail,
Thro' fear and terror deep.

CHORUS
Just one step more, but one step more 
Is all I need to know,
And light is sure from heav'n itself;
Just one step more to go.

2.
It may be that it winds along
A smooth and flow'ry way;
And seeing this I might despise
The journey of today.

(CHORUS)

3.
Perhaps my path is very short,
My journey nearly done;
And I might tremble at the thought
Of ending it so soon.

(CHORUS)
