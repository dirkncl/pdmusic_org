                         THE ARGUMENT.
  PART I.---God's chosen people mourne in a strange
land.  They urge each other to trust and confidence in
God, who commands them to worship the golden
image.  They refuse, and exhort each other to courage.
The three Princes are cast into the furnace.  Their
wondrous preservation there is watched by the King
and a chorus us Assyrians.  It is celebrated by a chorus
of Assyrians.  It is celebrated by a choral, followed by
a chorus of thanksgiving.
  PART II.---The Jews still long to return to their
own land.  The Persians conquer the Assyrians, and
join in a jubilant chorus.  The Presidents and Prices are
jealous of the foreign origin of Daniel.  They consult
how they may remove him.  The King commands every
one to worship him alone for thirty days.  Daniel prays
to his God as he had always done.  The Princes hear
him and shout for joy.  The Queen tell the King, who
is troubled.  Daniel is placed in the lion's den.  The
King goes to see Daniel, and finds him safe in the midst
of the lions.  The Persians praise the all-powerful God
in chorus.
  PART III.---The Jews confess their sins, led by
Daniel, who anounces God's pardon.  They pray that
Zion may be restored.  The King allows Daniel and
Azariah to go to raise again the walls of Jerusalem.
The Queen adds her blessings on them, and they wish
the King long life and happiness.  They arive at
Jerusalem.  In the final chorus they praise God that
they once more possess their own city, and ask his
protection.

Soon shall they wake again.

Hope to each heart returning,
Kindles its sacred flame,
God hath in mercy heard us,
Praise to His holy name.

[with many overlapping voices, abbrev. here]
Haste to our ruin'd temple,
Build we its walls once more,
God, our own God will bless us,
While we His aid implore.

With contrite hearts to Thee we pray,
O Father, hear our entreaty,
Turn not Thy face from us away,
But show Thy tender pity.
In Thee alone is Israel's hope,
O never more forsake us.

Hope to each heart returning,
Kindles its sacred flame,
God hath in mercy heard us,
Praise to His holy name.

|: Praise, Praise to His holy name,
Praise, Praise to His holy name. :|

Amen, Amen, A ... men.
