"Where Home Is" (1879)
[from page 83 of "The Palace of Song"]
Words and Music
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
[DUET, Soprano & ALto]
Home's not merely four square walls,
Tho' with pictures hung and gilded;
Home is where affection calls---
Filled with shrines the heart hath builded.
Home! go watch the faithful dove,
Sailing 'neath the heav'ns above us,
Home is where there's one to love,
Home is where there's on to love us.

CHORUS with overlapped voices
[Tenor (prominent)]
Home! Home! sweet, sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.
[Soprano, Alto and Bass]
Home is where there's one to love us,
Home is there, home is there,
Home is where there's one to meet us,
Home is there, home is there.

2.
Home's not merely roof and room,
Needs it something to endear it;
Home is where the heart can bloom;
Where there's some kind lip to cheer it.
What is home with none to meet?
None to welcome---none to great us?
Home is sweet---and only sweet---
When there's one we love to meet us.

(CHORUS)
