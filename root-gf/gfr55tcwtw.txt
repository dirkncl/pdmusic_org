1. 
Beneath the brow of yonder hill, 
That aged trees surround, 
While wand’ring forth at close of day 
A little Church I found. 
Its sweet repose and solitude 
impressed my heart with good, 
And told me gentle peace o’re-hung 
The little Church within the wood.

CHORUS
The Church within the wood, 
the church within the wood, 
Where e’er I go I’ll ne’er forget 
The little Church within the wood.

2. 
While gaz ing on the quiet scene, 
The crescent moon arose, 
And cast her silvery veil o’er earth 
To guard its deep repose. 
Bathed in a flood of purest light 
the little temple stood, 
Each moonbeam seemed to make more fair 
The liittle Church within the wood.

3. 
I love to look on lofty walls 
For sacred worship raised, 
Where in imposing majesty 
His holy name is praised. 
But ah! the ever watchful eye 
sees but the heart that’s good, 
And loves to meet his children in 
The little Church within the wood.

4. 
What nobler anthem does He need 
Than music of the pines, 
What nobler habitations 
He than humble contrite minds! 
Oh! give thy lowly servant this, 
thou parent of all good, 
Then for these thoughts I’ll love still more 
The little Church within the wood.
