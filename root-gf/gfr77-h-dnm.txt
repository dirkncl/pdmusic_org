"Doubt No More" (1877)
by George Frederick Root

"Be not faithless, but believing."

1.
All were there within the room,
Waiting for the Lord to come,
'Mid the twelve, poor Thomas stands,
Saying, "could I see His hands."

REFRAIN
Had thou doubted? doubt no more;
Christ is here within the door.
Bow as trembling Thomas bowed,
Say with him, my Lord, my God,
Say with him, my Lord, my God.

2.
"Peace be unto you;" sweet words,
They could only be the Lord's,
Oh, the joy that Thomas felt,
As before his God he knelt.

(REFRAIN)

3.
"Blessed they who have not seen,
Yet who faithless have not been."
Spoke the Lord to Thomas thus,
Speaks He so and now to us

(REFRAIN)
