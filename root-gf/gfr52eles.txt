1.
Within her downy cradle,
There lay a little child,
And a group of hov'ring angels,
Unseen upon her smil'd.
A strife arose among them,
A loving holy strife,
Which should shed the richest blessings
Over the new born life.

2.
One breath'd upon her features,
And the babe in beauty grew
With a cheek like morning's blushes
And an eye of azure hue
'Till ev'ry one who saw her
was thankful for the sight,
Of a face so sweet and radiant, 
with ever fresh delight.

3.
Another gave her accents,
and a voice as musical
As a spring birds joyous carol
Or a ripling streamlet's fall
'Till all who knew heard her laughing
or her words of childish grace,
Lov'd as much to listen to her
as to look upon her face.

4.
Another brought from heaven
a clear and gentle mind
And within the lovely casket
The precious gem enshrin'd
'Till all who knew her wonder'd
that God should be so good,
As to bless with such a spirit
our desert world and rude.

5.
Thus did she grow in beauty
in melody and truth
The budding of her childhood
just opening into youth
And to our hearts yet dearer
ev'ry moment than before,
She became though we thought fondly,
Heart could not love her more.

6.
Then out spake another angel
nobler brighter than the rest,
As with a strong arm but tender
he caught her to his breast,
Ye have made her all too lovely
for a child of mortal race,
but no shade of human sorrow
shall darken o'er her face.

7.
Ye have tund to gladness only
the accents of her tongue
And no wail of human anquish
shall from her lips be wrung,
Nor shall the soul that shineth
so purely from within,
Her form of earth born frailty
ever know the taint of sin.

8.
Lull'd on my faithfull bosom
I will bear her far away,
Where there is no sin nor anquish
nor sorrow nor decay,
And mine a gift more glorious
than all you gifts shall be,
Lo! I crown her happy spirit
with immortality.

9.
Then on his heart our darling
yielded up her gentle breath,
For the stronger brighter angel
who lov'd her best was DEATH!
