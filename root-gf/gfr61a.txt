To All who Love Union and freedom.
"God Bless Our Brave Young Volunteers!" (1861)
Words and Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Hark the song of freedom how it swells
O'er valley, hill and prairie wide,
With thrilling tones the tocsin tells
That dangers to our land betide,
That dangers to our land betide,
And see; from anvil, loom and plow,
From home, and mothers sacred tears
They fly with ardor on each brow,
God bless our brave young volunteers
God blees our brave young volunteers.

2.
Still, still the glorious members ring,
And still they come our land to save,
Let every heart its tribute bring
Of love, and honor to the brave,
Of love, and honor to the brave,
May He protect them in their strife
Whose power can quell our rising fears
Oh may He guard each precious life
And bless our brave young volunteers
And bless our brave young volunteers.

3.
Oh home of freedom, fatherland,
To thee our treasure now we yield,
The duty calls, their feet stand
In tented camp, on bloody field;
Farewell true hearts our pray'rs shall be
Where o'er the starry flag appears
That He who made our fathers free
May bless our brave young volunteers
May bless our brave young volunteers.
