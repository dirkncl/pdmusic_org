"In Sleep's Serene" (1852)
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
from page 209 of "The Academy Vocalist"

1.
In sleep’s serene oblivion laid,
I safely passed the silent night;
Again, I see the breaking shade,
I drink the morning light.

2.
O guide me through the various maze
My doubtful feet are doomed to tread;
And spread the shield’s protecting blaze,
When danger peers around my head.
