1. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,
Marching on in order firm
Till halt is the word;
Then tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,
Over hill and mountain steep,
Our heavy tread is heard;

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Now the trumpet’s sounding,
Cheerily, cheerilly on,
And tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,
Ever on o’er vale and hill
Our steady course we keep.

2. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,
Strong and fearless are our hearts,
As onward we go;
Then tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,
Up the wild and rugged steeps,
Where torrents quickly flow;
