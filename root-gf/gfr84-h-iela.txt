1.
In eastern lands afar,
Where morning first awakes,
The song of "Peace, and good will to man,"
Upon the still air breaks.
And as the newborn light
Speeds on its westward way,
The bells ring out, and glad hearts shout:
"All hail! 'tis Christmas day!"

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So round (So round) and round (and round)
the swift revolving earth
(the rolling earth
The joyful)
The story flies of Jesus' birth,
Of Jesus' wond'rous birth.

2.
The happy children sing
In cottage and in hall
Of that dear child who came today
To save and bless us all.
And as the onward sun
Lights up the gilded spires
They blend again their glad refrain
With joyful Christmas choirs.

3.
And when a shadow falls
On lonely homes and sad,
Will loving gifts speak of his care
Who makes the mourner glad.
From Bethl'em to the sea,
In ev'ry clime and home,
The blessing of this Christmas day
To every land will come.
