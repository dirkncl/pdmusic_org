1. What’s the use of so much fretting
Over what we can’t restrain,
It might save us much regretting
If it rains— to let it rain.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let it rain,
  Let it rain, let it rain,
Let it rain,
 Let it rain,
Let it rain, let it rain,
 Let it rain,
It will save us much regretting,
If it rains— to let it rain, let it rain.

2. Say not that the world’s a fetter,
Spending hours in needless pain,
Lend a hand to make it better,
If it rains— why, let it rain.

3. Herb and tree, the plants and flowers,
Blooming dell and grassy plain,
Come to gild earth’s joyous bowers,
If it rains— just let it rain.

4. Rains are poured upon the mountains,
(Not a drop that falls in vain,)
Helping fill the flowing fountains,
If it rains— do let it rain.
