1.
O you dearest brother we miss thee,
  With joy would we welcome thee home;
Thy place here too long has been vacant
  O say wilt thou never return!
We miss thee at morning and evening,
  And then the calm sabbath day:
We listen again for thy coming,
  But no, thou art far, far away.

[CHORUS]
We listen again for thy coming,
  But no, thou art far, far away.

2.
We miss thee when joining our voices
  In songs long familiar to sing,
We think of the voice so far distant
  And wish thou wert with us again;
Then come dearest brother and cheer us
  Once more with thine own happy smile,
Our hearts now in sadness are pining,
  O come and our sorrow beguile!

[CHORUS]
Our hearts now in sadness are pining,
  O come and our sorrow beguile!

3.
But tho' dearest brother we never
  May meet there in this world again,
We hope to behold thee in Heaven,
  And oh, may that hope not be vain;
Oh, then let us strive to be cheerful,
  And live that the day may soon come,
When hearts free'd from sin and all sorrow,
  Thou'll ever be with us at Home.

[CHORUS]
When hearts free'd from sin and all sorrow,
  Thou'll ever be with us at Home.
