"Ended Now the Mason's Labor" (1866)
(The Mason's Holiday)
from "Songs of the Free Masons" [#2]
Words by Robert Morris L.L.D.
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Ended now the Mason's labor,
Past the travel and the toil,
Gather in each loving neighbor,
Share the corn, the wine, the oil.
Brethren now of each degree
Come in harmony and glee.
Happy meeting,
Gentle greeting,
'Tis the joy of Masonry.

2.
Spirits of the blest departed,
As of earthly ways they roam,
Where are we: the faithful hearted
They to share our labors come.
Tho' their forms we cannot see,
They are here with you and me.
Happy meeting,
Gentle greeting,
'Tis the joy of Masonry.

3.
Love unites us with its cement,
Truth inspires the Mason's breast:
Ever faithful, ever element,
Thus our doctrine we attest.
Thus we come of each degree
Come in harmony and glee.
Happy meeting,
Gentle greeting,
'Tis the joy the joy of Masonry.
