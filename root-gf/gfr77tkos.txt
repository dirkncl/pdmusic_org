1.
Who will belong to the kingdom of song?
Let ev'ry heart in the worshiping throng,
Gladly be one in the kingdom of song.

2.
Who will belong to the kingdom of song?
Ev'ry brave heart who would battle with wrong
Let him find strength in the kingdom of song.

3.
Who will belong to the kingdom of song?
Would you for God, home and country, be strong?
Haste to the wide spreading kingdom of song.
