"Oh, Haste on the Battle!" (1862)
Words by R. Tompkins
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
O haste on the battle, the sure coming battle,
  When vict'ry shall perch on our banners at last,
A sign has been given a promise from heaven,
  And days of defeats and disasters are past.

CHORUS
Then haste, haste, haste, haste,
Haste on the battle,
  'Tis Liberty for all
Then haste, haste, haste, haste,
Haste on the battle,
  The Tyrant must fall.

2.
The word has been spoken, the long look'd for token
  Now glows on our banners and gleams in the air,
The "Freedom for all" how the spell has been broken
  That bound all the land in the chains of despair.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come fill up the ranks and prepare for the battle
  No longer ask who our leader shall be,
For God now is, with us in Him we will shall triumph,
  The God of our Fathers, the God of the free.

(CHORUS)

4.
Prepare for the battle, we care not who guides it,
  The bright sword of vict'ry, we care not who wields,
McLellan, or Burnside, or Hooker, or Sigel,
  Or Fremont, or Hunter, or Buttler, or Shields.

(CHORUS)

5.
'Tis Liberty's battle, and Slavery's death rattle,
  For Freedom shall follow where lately it trod.
And after the battle, shall man, now a chattle,
  Stand forth in his freedom, the image of God.

(CHORUS)

6.
And Oh, what a glory, will gleam in the story
  Our children shall tell to each daughter and son;
Of the wonderful battle, the terrible battle,
  When their country was saved, and his liberties won.

(CHORUS)
