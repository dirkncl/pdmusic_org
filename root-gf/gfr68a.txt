To E. Chamberlin, Esq., of Milwaukee.
"If Maggie Were My Own!" (1868)
Song & Chorus.
Words by Lieutenant S. H. M. Byers
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
If Maggie were my own, now,
And I yon shepherd lad,
Whose lute is full of sweetness,
Whose song is never sad;
O, lightly might the winds blow,
As lightly they have blown,
Yet, lighter would my heart be,
If Maggie were my own.

CHORUS
Oh, if she were my own,
If Maggie were my own,
How happy would my life be,
If Maggie were my own.

2.
If Maggie were my own, now,
And I were born a king,
A crown of stars and jewels,
Would be no regal thing,
Until my darling wore it --
Sure, ev'ry star that shone
Would wear but borrowed splendor,
If Maggie were my own.

(CHORUS)

3.
If Maggie were my own, now,
The earth and sea and air,
To me would smile in gladness,
And beauty ev'rywhere;
O, little would I heed them,
The sorrows I have known,
Since clouds would melt in sunshine,
If Maggie were my own.

(CHORUS)

4.
If Maggie were my own, now,
Then love, were life indeed,
Though Time, should gallop faster,
Upon his wing-ed steed,
Yes, Time might gallup faster,
Than ever life has flown,
Yet, love should be his master,
If Maggie were my own.

(CHORUS)
