1.
[Base]
We have wandered long from the household throng.
From the old familiar places.
[Alto]
And our hearts are light with our joy, tonight
As we greet your smiling faces.
[Tenor]
From our native shore we will roam no more
While the bright skies bend above us;
[Soprano]
Naught shall tempt our feet from our blest retreat
With the friends who truly

CHORUS
love us. (Oh,...we are)
Home (home again re-) re- (-turning.)
-turn- (home again re-) -ing (-turning.)
ne- (Never) -er (more to) more (wander) from (from our)
thee (happy) to (land a-) stray. (-way. Oh, we're)
Home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain (-turning)
home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain. (-turn-)
Oh, (-ing.) joy- (Pour it forth with thankful
-ful (hearts, the) lay. (joyful, joyful lay.)

2.
[Base]
Tho' the winds are light and the skies are bright
In the land where we've been straying.
[Alto]
The the clime is fair and a balmy air air
With its summer flow'rs is playing.
[Tenor]
Yet our hearts turned still, with a right good will,
To the land beyond the ocean;
[Soprano]
And we breath'd its name and we sang its fame
With a tide of sweet e-

CHORUS
-motion. (Oh,...we are)
Home (home again re-) re- (-turning.)
-turn- (home again re-) -ing (-turning.)
ne- (Never) -er (more to) more (wander) from (from our)
thee (happy) to (land a-) stray. (-way. Oh, we're)
Home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain (-turning)
home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain. (-turn-)
Oh, (-ing.) joy- (Pour it forth with thankful
-ful (hearts, the) lay. (joyful, joyful lay.)


3.
[Base]
How our heart still clings to the simple things
We have loved in days long vanished!
[Alto]
Ere our lives grew cold our hearts felt old,
Or the dreams of youth were banished!
[Tenor]
We have wandered far, but our guiding star
O'er the Western waters burning,
[Soprano]
Sheds its starry light on our darkest night,
And we're home again re-

CHORUS
-turning! (Oh,...we are)
Home (home again re-) re- (-turning.)
-turn- (home again re-) -ing (-turning.)
ne- (Never) -er (more to) more (wander) from (from our)
thee (happy) to (land a-) stray. (-way. Oh, we're)
Home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain (-turning)
home (home a-) a- (-gain re-) -gain. (-turn-)
Oh, (-ing.) joy- (Pour it forth with thankful
-ful (hearts, the) lay. (joyful, joyful lay.)
