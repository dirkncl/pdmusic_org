1. Beauiful Angel on pinions of light,
Wait till I whisper my Mother good night;
List while she calls me her pride and her joy,
Folds to her bosom her own little boy,
Hover around her on pinions of light,
Mother, dear, Mother, O! kiss me good night.

2. Beautiful Angel, her sorrow is sore,
Weeping for one who will weep nevermore;
Waft her sweet dreams of the blessed above,
Tell her, our God is a Father of love;
Only for this, am I staying my flight,
Mother, dear Mother, forever goodnight.

3. Beautiful Angel, thrice blessed art thou!
See, there’s a smile on the dear palid brow;
Token of faith that hath conquered her fears,
Token that time will have solace for tears;
Prest to those lips in their agony white,
Mother, dear Mother forever goodnight.
