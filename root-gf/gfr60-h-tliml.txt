Anthem.

[Source: pp. 328-330 of "The Diapason" (June 1860)
by George Frederic Root]

The Lord is my light and my salvation;
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life;
Of whom shall I be afraid?

Tho' a host should encamp against me,
My heart shall not fear,
Tho' war should rise against me,
in this will I be confident,
One thing I have desired of the Lord,
That will I seek after
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord,

||: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord,
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
all the days, all the days of my life, :||

Amen.
