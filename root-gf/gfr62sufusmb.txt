1.
Stand up for Uncle Sam, my boys,
With hearts brave and true;
Stand up for Uncle Sam, my boys,
For he has stood up by you.
He's made you homes the brightest
The sun o'er shone upon.
For honor, right and freedom,
He's many a battle won.

CHORUS
Stand up for Uncle Sam, my boys,
With hearts brave and true.
Stand up for Uncle Sam, my boys,
For he has stood up by you.

2.
Oh, strike for Uncle Sam, my boys,
For danger is near;
Yes! strike for Uncle Sam, my boys,
And all to you most dear.
Rebellious sons are plotting
To lay the homestead low.
Their hands are madly lifted
To give the fatal blow.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh, fall for Uncle Sam, my boys,
If need be to save;
Yes! fall for Uncle Sam, my boys,
Tho' in a soldier's grave.
His flag so long our glory
Dishonor'd shall not be
But heav'nward float forever
The banner of the free.

(CHORUS)
