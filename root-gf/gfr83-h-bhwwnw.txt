1.
Blessed he who will not walk
In the counsel of ungodly ones;
Blessed who the ways of sin,
And the seat of scorners ever shuns.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
His delight shall ever be, (ever be,)
In Thy sacred law, O Lord, (O Lord);
Day and night shall he meditate
On Thy holy word.

2.
He shall, like a beauteous tree
Planted by the living waters, stand
In his season, bringing forth
Precious fruit to gladden all the land.

3.
The ungodly are not so,
But are like the chaff which flies away;
Only shall the righteous man
Stand securely in the judgement day.
