1. 
[SATB]
Blow, warder, blow thy sounding horn! 
And thy banner wave on high! 
For the Christians have fought in the holy land 
And have won, have won the victory, 
And have won the victory, 
[B]
Then the warder looked from his tow’r on high, 
[T]
As far as he could see, 
[SATB]
“I see a bold Knight and by his red cross 
He comes from the east, from the east country, 
He comes from the east country. 

2. 
[ovelapping voices]
[SA]
Then loud he blew
And
[TB]
Then loud the warder blew his horn, 
And he

[SATB]
called till he was hoarse, 
I see a bold Knight 
And on his shield so bright, 
He beareth a flaming cross. 

[DUET]
[AT]
Then down the Lord of the castle came 
The red cross Knight to meet, 
And when the red cross Knight he espied, 
Right lovingly did he greet. 

[CHORUS]
[SATB]
Thou’rt welcome here, dear red cross Knight, 
Thy fame’s well known to me. 
Let the 

[overlapping voices]
[S]
mass be sung
[ATB]
mass be sung and the bells be rung

[SATB]
And we’ll feast right merrily, merrily, 
we’ll feast right merrily, 
Let the mass be sung and the bells be run, 
And we’ll feast right merrily, merrily, 
Let the mass be sung and the bells be rung 
And we’ll feast right merrily, merrily, 
We’ll feast right merrily.
