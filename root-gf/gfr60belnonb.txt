1.
Full well do I remember
My boyhoods happy hours,
The cottage and the garden
Where bloomed the fairest flowers,
The bright and sparkling water
O'er which we used to sail
With hearts so gay, for miles away
Before the gentle gale.
I had a dear companion
But she's not with me now,
The lily of the valley
Is waving o'er her brow,
And I am sad and lonely
And mourning all the day
For bright eyed laughing little
Nell of Naragansett bay.

2.
I loved the little beauty,
My boatm it was my pride,
And with her close beside me
Whay joy the foam to ride,
She's laugh with tone so merry
To see see the waves go by,
As wildly blew the story wind
And murky was the sky.
Tho' lightnings flashed around us
And all was dark and drear,
We loved to brave old Ocean,
And never dreamed of fear
'Tho Arrow bounded onward
And darted through the spray
With bright laughing little
Nell of Naragansett bay.

3.
One day from us she wandered,
And soon within the boat
The cord was quickly loosened
And with the tide afloat,
The treacherous bark flew lightly
And swift before the wind,
While home, and friends, and all so dear,
Were many many miles behind.
Next day her form all lifeless
Was washed upon the beach,
I stood and gazed upon it
Bereft of sence and speech
'Tis years since thus we parted,
But here I weep to day
For bright eyed and laughing little
Nell of Naragansett bay.
