To the Memory of P. P. Bliss.
"The New Voice in the Heavenly Choir" (1877)
Words by Paulina.
Music by George Frederick Root.

1.
Heav'nly song, and heavenly singer!
Round the throne his loved tones linger,
While true Faith's unerring finger
Points the way to realms above.

CHORUS
'Mid the "New Song" grandly swelling,
While our hearts and tones are knelling,
Sweet and tenderly he's telling
Of his Saviour's dying love.

2.
"Going home," he sang, "tomorrow!"
Light from heav'n he seemed to borrow;
"Going home no more to sorrow,"
In the happy realms above.

(CHORUS)

3.
"Hold the fort!" still hear him singing!
All the world the echo ringing,
Precious souls to bless him bringing,
Stars of joy, in crowns above.

(CHORUS)
