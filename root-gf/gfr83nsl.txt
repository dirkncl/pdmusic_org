Words and Music by
George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
No Section Lines, no North, no South,
No East, my boys, no West;
'Tis one and undivided now,
This land to us the best.
North, south, east, west, as compass points
Are good enough, no doubt,
But when they sever hearts and hands,
Why, then we cast them out.

CHORUS
Repeat it o'er and o'er, (Repeat it o'er,)
One Land for evermore, (One evermore,)
One Hope, one Aim, one Flag o'er all,
From Gulf to Inland sea,
From Ocean grand to Ocean calm,
United, Strong and Free.

2.
Once brothers met at duty's call,
And fought with furious might,
And thousands died on field and wave
For what they thought was right.
Have all these conglicts been for nought,--
These treasures spent in vain?
No! with a warmer, firmer bond
We meet as one again.

(CHORUS)

3.
By all most sacred and most dear,--
The mem'ries of our dead,--
The mem'ries of the battlefields
On which our brothers bled.
Together we will aye defend
This land of heroes' graves,
Wherever Freedom's sunlight falls,
Or Freedom's banner waves.

(CHORUS)
