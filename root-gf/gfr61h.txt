THE VACANT CHAIR
Words by H.S. Washburn
Music by George F. Root (1861)


We shall meet but we shall miss him. 
There will be one vacant chair.
We shall linger to caress him 
While we breathe our ev'ning prayer.
When one year ago we gathered, 
Joy was in his mild blue eye.
Now the golden cord is severed, 
And our hopes in ruin lie. 

CHORUS: We shall meet, but we shall miss him.
There will be one vacant chair.
We shall linger to caress him
While we breathe our ev'ning prayer. 

At our fireside, sad and lonely, 
Often will the bosom swell
At remembrance of the story 
How our noble Willie fell.
How he strove to bear the banner 
Thro' the thickest of the fight
And uphold our country's honor 
In the strength of manhood's might.

CHORUS 

True, they tell us wreaths of glory 
Evermore will deck his brow,
But this soothes the anguish only, 
Sweeping o'er our heartstrings now.
Sleep today, O early fallen, 
In thy green and narrow bed.
Dirges from the pine and cypress 
Mingle with the tears we shed. 

CHORUS
