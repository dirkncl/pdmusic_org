1.
Down the column of the ages
Grandest echoes roll along,
Ever in their force increasing,
Till the earth is filled with song.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Clear and sweet the full vibrations,
Of the mighty, mighty song,
For the grand key note is Jesus,
And it thrills the countless throng.

2.
Ever, ever still increasing,
Sounding o'er each distant chime,
Till our earth e'ev up to Heaven,
Echoes with the hallow'd rhyme.

3.
Let us sing our Saviour's praises,
Tarrying in this under clime,
Yonder we will sing hosannas,
Measured not by flight of time.
