1.
They are coming from the mountains;
coming from the plain,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
From the grand Pacific slope and
from the coast of Maine,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

CHORUS
Blaine for our President,
Echoes the rills,
Blaine for our President,
Answers the hills.
They are coming from the mountains,
comming from the plains,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

2.
They are comming with their banners
waving in the light,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
Men who fought to save the country are
coming in their sight,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

CHORUS
Blaine for our President,
Sounds on the air,
Blaine for our President,
sings every where,
They are comming with their banners
waving in the light,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

3.
We have got a man to lead us
honest, pure and good,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
Who will labor to maintain
eternal brotherhood,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

CHORUS
Blaine for our President,
Thus shall we stand,
Union and Liberty!
over the land.
We have got a man to lead us
honest, pure and good,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

4.
No scheming politician shall
lead us in the fight,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
We are sure to gain the victory
working for the right,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

CHORUS

5.
Now rally up your father, all,
loyal men and true,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
For there is a glorious work for each
noble heart to do,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom!

CHORUS
