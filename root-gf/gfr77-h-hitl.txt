"He Is the Lord" (1877)
by George Frederick Root

"I am thy God, and beside my there is no Savior."

1.
He is the Lord thy Savior,
There is no God beside;
The Father in Him, He the Son,
On whom our hopes abide.
The Spirit thence proceeding,
From Father and from Son,
Makes up the blessed Trinity,
The wondrous Three in One.

2.
'Twas He who came to save us.
There was no other one.
'Twas He alone on the earth
Was "with us" as the Son.
At first poor human nature
Was tempted like as we,
But at last 'twas glorified,
And triumphed gloriously.

3.
And now there is no way, soul,
To God, but thro' the Son.
The Father still is there within,
And they alone are One.
'Tis their own influent spirit
That sets poor sinners free.
And oh! my soul, He's striving now,
This moment, here, with thee.
