"Our Pastor" (1855)
Composed by George Frederick Root

1.
Pure and sacred is the love
We to our faithful Pastor hear;
Kindly o'er his little flock
He watches with a Father's care;
Tenderly he leads the erring ones,
To duty's path of peace,
Pointing upward to that home,
Where sorrows shall forever cease.

CHORUS
Heaven bless the name we hold so dear,
Our Pastor and our friend,
Ever shall our grateful prayer,
At night and morn for him ascend.

(CHORUS pp)

2.
With the [- eist ?] group he joins,
Their innocent delight to shame,
And the sparkling eyes of youth,
With gladness bid him welcome there;
For he hath a cheerful word for all,
And old and young rejoice,
While they greet his quiet smile,
Or listen to his kindly voice.

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS pp)

3.
By the sufferer's weary couch,
how oft with lifted hand he kneels;
And the silent tear drop tells
The grief his tender spirit feels;
From the holy book of truth he reads
The promise God has given,
Come ye heavy laden -- come,
And ye shall find a rest in heaven.

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS pp)
