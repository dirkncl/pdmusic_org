"Ring the Bells of Heaven" (1874)
Words by William Orcutt Cushing,
in "Sacred Songs", by Ira Sankey, 1874.
[Luke 15:10]
Music by George Frederick Root.

1.
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For a soul, returning from the wild!
See, the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.

CHORUS
Glory! Glory!
How the angels sing;
Glory! Glory!
How the loud harps ring!

2.
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today,
For the wand'rer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born anew a ransomed child.

(CHORUS)

3.
Ring the bells of heaven!
Spread the feast today!
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tiding, bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again.

(CHORUS)

4.
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
