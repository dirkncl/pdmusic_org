"The Star of Bethlehem" (3 Dec. 1884)
Quartet for Mixed Voices
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

When marshall'd on the nightly plain,
The glitt'ring host bestud the sky,
One star alone of all the train
Can fix the sinner's wand'ring eye;
Hark! hark! to God the chorus breaks
From ev'ry host, from ev'ry gem,
But one alone the Savior speaks,
It is the star of Bethlehem,
It is the star of Bethlehem.
But one, but one,
The star, the star of Bethlehem.
But one, the star, the star of Bethlehem,
The star of Bethlehem,
The star of Bethlehem.
