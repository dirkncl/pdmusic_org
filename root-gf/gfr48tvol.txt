[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Gently Ah gently
Gently Ah gently
Light breezes blowing
Light breezes blowing
Waft to the dear ones the voice of love
Waft to the dear ones the voice of love
The voice of love
The voice of love

1.
Come robing night thy dark mantle throwing
Shield us from all but the bright eyes above
Come robing night thy dark mantle throwing
Shield us from all but the bright eyes above

2.
Fairest of earth born thy spirit is near thee
Sweetly the gale bears the balm of thy sigh
Fairest of earth born thy spirit is near thee
Sweetly the gale bears the balm of thy sigh
Sweetly the gale bears the balm of thy sigh
