1.
There's something to live for and something to love,
Where ever we wander, where ever we rove.
There are thousands of sad cares to cheer and sustain
Till the hopes that were hidden beam o'er them again.

2.
There's something to live for and something to love
For the spirit of man's like a garden or grove
'Twill yield you sweet fragrance, but still you must toil
And cherish the blossoms and culture the soil.

3.
There's something to live for and something to love,
'Tis a truth which the misanthrope ne'er can disprove
For tho' thorns, weeds and thistles may choke up the flowers
Some beauty will grace the most desolate bowers.

4.
Then think on it Brother, whoever thou art
Let thy life be for man and the love for the heart
For know that the pathway that leads us above
Is something to live for and somthing to love.
