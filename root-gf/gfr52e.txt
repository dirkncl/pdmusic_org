"The Time of the Heart" (1852)
Ballad
Sung by Mademoiselle Rosa Jaques
Composed by George Frederick Root

[Intro: Con expressivo]
1.
[Allegretto]
Oh merry goes the time
When the heart is young,
There is nought too hard to climb
When the heart is young.
A spirit of delight
Scatters roses in its flight,
And there's magic in the night
When the heart is young.

CHORUS 1
Yes merry goes the time
When the heart is young,
It sings a joyful chime
When the heart is young,
When the heart is young.

2.
[Slower]
Oh weary go the feet
When the heart is old
Time cometh not so sweet
When the heart is old
From all that smil'd and shone
There is something lost and gone
And our friends are few or none
When the heart is old.

CHORUS 2
[Allegretto]
But merry goes the time
When the heart is young,
It rings a merry chime,
When the heart is young,
When the heart is young.

3.
[Animato]
Oh sparkling are the skies
When the heart is young,
There is bliss in beauty's eyes
When the heart is young,
The golden break of day,
Bringeth gladness in the ray,
And ev'ry month is May,
When the heart is young.

CHORUS 3
[Vivace]
Yes merry goes the time
When the heart is young
It rings a joyful chime
When the heart is young,
When the heart is young.

4.
[Slower]
Oh the sun is setting fast,
When the heart is old,
And the sky is overcast,
When the heart is old.
Life's worn and weary bark
Lies tossing wild and dark,
And the star has left hopes ark
When the heart is old.

CHORUS 4
[Animato]
But merry goes the time
When the heart is young
It rings a joyful chime
When the heart is young,
When the heart is young.
