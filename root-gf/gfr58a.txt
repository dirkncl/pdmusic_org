To John L. Loomis, Esq.
of Quincy, Illinois
"May of the Valley" (1858)
Song & Chorus.
by George Frederick Root

1.
'Tis May, sweet May of the valley,
Light hearted joyous and free,
With blithesome song
She bounds along
O'er dewy lea,
The pearly stream of the woodland,
The gentle voice of the gale,
The flow'rets gay
Seem all to say:
May is the darling of the vale.

CHORUS
Yes hark! to the music stealing
Far on the summer air,
Joyously swelling, gladly telling:
May is good and fair, 
The voices sweet of the woodland,
The murmur low of the dale,
They float away,
But ever say:
May is the darling of the vale.

2.
The early song of the wild bird,
That wakes the sweet forest rose,
The sparkling brook
And shady nook
Where the violet grows,
The star of eve as it lingers
Along the time covered dale,
All wake the lay
That seems to say:
May is the darling of the vale.

(CHORUS)

3.
Where e'er her light step reposes,
In woodland, cottage, or hall,
Though joy resounds,
the fortune frowns
Welcome she to all,
And so the tones of affection
Are borne away on the gale,
They swell the lay
That seems to say:
May is the darling of the vale.

(CHORUS)
