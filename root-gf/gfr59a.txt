(To my little "Nell")
"Don't You See Me Coming" (1859)
Song of the Bob O Link
from "Songs from Willow Farm", No. 4
by George Frederick Root

1.
Don't you see me coming, coming, coming right along,
Here's the little grassy meadow where I sing my song.
I am mister Bob o Link_en, that I s'pose you know,
Blitsey Leedle is my wife she's in the grass below, yes, yes, yes,
Don't you see me comming, coming, coming right along,
Here's the little grassy meadow where my folks belong.

2.
I've been winking, blinking, prinking, ever since the morn,
Waiting for the men to go and leave that field of corn,
Blitsey Leedle's waiting too, but never makes a sound.
She's a modest little thing and wears a russet gown yes, yes, yes,
Don't you see me comming, coming, coming right along,
Here's the little grassy meadow where my folks belong.

3.
Bob o link-en, link-en, wink-en, all in black and gold,
We must have our breakfast soon, or I shall have it cold.
Pretty little Blitsey Leedle, sitting on the nest
Thinks if she takes care the house that I can do the rest yes, yes, yes,
Don't you see me comming, coming, coming right along,
There's a chance, the men are off, and now I'll stop my song.
