"Passing Through the Fire" (1871)
Song and Chorus
Words and Music by
George Frederick Root

1.
Flames! Flames! terrible flames!
How they rise, how they mount, how the fly.
The heavens are spread with a fierce lurid glare,
The red heat is filling the earth and the air,
While mercy! mercy! We hear the despairing ones cry.

CHORUS
We are passing thro' the fire! passing thro' the fire,
But it is our Father's hand,
Though we may not understand
Why we're passing thro' the fire, passing thro' the fire!

2.
Flames! Flames! terrible flames!
How the sweep, how they rush, how they roar.
See their hideous tongues around the roof, tree, and spire,
As swells their wild carnival higher and higher,
Till falling! crashing! Our glorious city's no more.

(CHORUS)

3.
Flames! Flames! terrible flames!
What a fearful destruction they bring.
What suff'ring and want in their train follow fast,
As forth on the streets homeless thousands are cast,
But courage! courage! From the midst of the furnace we sing.

(CHORUS)
