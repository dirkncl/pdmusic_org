"The Sleep in the Dust" (1852)
by Geoge Frederick Root

1.
They sleep in the dust and the grave has close'd o'er them.
They repose in the vale where our forefathers lie.
The cares of this life never more shall assail them.
They bade them adieu when they laid down to die.
The church-going bell it yet calls us to worship
As it breaks on the ear in the still Sabbath air.
How oft at its call have they gather'd their children
And led their young steps to the Temple of prayer.

2.
Their long life has pass'd and though oft it was shaded
With sorrow's dark cloud as it glided along.
Yet as evening drew on the bleak storm abated,
And their sun sank in brightness its glories among.
The glowing wood fire still it burns on the hearth stone.
The familiar old furniture stands round the wall.
E'en the ancient old clock ticks away in its corner,
But father and mother no longer they call.

3.
The easy arm chairs where so oft they were seated,
To while with their converse the long winter's eve.
How empty they stand and no longer we're greeted
With the warm gushing welcome but parents can give.
They sleep in the dust, ah! no, they have risen,
With pinnions of angels they're winging their way,
And as star after star they revisit in heaven,
They becken us up, with 'come children,' away.
