1. 
THE SABBATH BELL! how glad the sound 
As far and wide its tones resound! 
Come then, with joy its call obey, 
And join in love to praise and pray.

2. 
THE SABBATH BELL, with voice so clear,
Shall reach the distant wanderer’s ear,
Inviting him to return and meet
His loved ones round the mercy seat.
