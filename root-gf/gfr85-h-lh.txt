1. Savior teach me day by day,
Love’s sweet chanson to obey;
Sweeter lesson can not be,
Loving him who first loved me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Loving him, loving him,
Sweeter lesson can not be;
Loving him, loving him,
Loving him who first loved me.

2. With a childlike heart of love,
At thy bidding may I move;
Prompt to serve and follow thee,
Loving him who first loved me.

3. Teach me all thy steps to trace,
Strong to follow in thy grace;
Learning how to love from thee,
Loving him who first loved me.

4. Love in loving finds employ,
In experience, all her joy;
Ever now that joy will be,
Loving him who first loved me.
