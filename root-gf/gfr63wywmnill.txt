1. O your eyes were dim with tears, love,
When you sobbed your last goodbye,
As I proudly marched away, love,
With my hopes so strong and high;
O I hear your gentle voice so dear, love,
As you said, I will be true,
And in danger don’t forget, love,
That I ever pray for you.

CHORUS
1. But now I do not claim, love,
The hand so dear to me,
For as you see I’m lame, love,
And ever so must be.

2. You are proud and fair my own, love,
And I know how hard ’twould be
In your beauty and your youth, love,
To be left with only me
To be left with only my pour heart, love,
Ah its hopes are all in vain,
I had rather we should part, love,
If the thought to you is pain.

CHORUS
2. And so I will not blame, love,
Should you recall your vow,
And think because I’m lame, love,
You can not wed me now.

3. But my poor heart could you know, love,
How its hopes were all with you,
And that while we’ve been apart, love,
Every pulse beat has been true,
And how on that dark and bloody field, love,
Thro’ the night so lone and drear
It was your sweet face alone, love,
That my visions made most clear.

CHORUS
3. Yet mark, I have no shame, love,
My wounds are freedom’s bands,
What matters though I’m lame, love,
Our glorious Union stands.

4. What, your eyes are full of tears, love,
And your lips are trembling too,
And you turn your blushing cheek, love,
From my long and earnest view
Can I hope ah, no the thought is vain, love,
But the hand why comes it near?
And those murmured words O joy, love,
They have banished every fear.

CHORUS
4. Oh yes, your heart’s the same, love,
In all that we’ve pass.d through,
You’ll wed me though I’m lame, love,
My beautiful, my true.
