"On Old Potomac's Shore" (1859)
by George Frederick Root
As Sung by Wood's Minstrels

1.
I'm growing old and weary now,
  But oh how sweet to me,
The spot where I so oft have play'd
  When all was mirth and glee;
But when these lips are cold and still,
  And life for me is o'er,
Then let them lay me down to sleep
  On old Potomac's shore,
Then let them lay me down to sleep,
  On old Potomac's shore.

CHORUS
Old Potomac's shore,
  Old Potomac's shore,
Then let them lay me down to sleep
  On old Potomac's shore.

2.
How oft the a-ged arms have borne
  Old massa's children dear!
I saw their little faces yet,
  Their lisping tones I hear;
I love them with a heart as true,
  As in those days of yore,
For they were always good to me
  On old Potomac's shore,
For they were always good to me
  On old Potomac's shore,

CHORUS
Old Potomac's shore,
  Old Potomac's shore,
For they were always good to me
  On old Potomac's shore,

3.
I sit and watch the lovely fields
  That look so green and fair,
And see the cattle as they feed
  Upon the tall grass there;
And tho' it makes me sigh to think
  That life will soon be o'er, --
Yet oh, how sweet will be my rest
  On Old Potomac's Shore.
Yet oh, how sweet will be my rest
  On Old Potomac's Shore.

CHORUS
Old Potomac's shore,
  Old Potomac's shore,
Yet oh, how sweet will be my sleep
  On Old Potomac's Shore.
