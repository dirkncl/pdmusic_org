1.
Wouldst thou hear thy Savior's voice?
Wouldst thou in his love rejoice?
Come and make his paths thy choice,
And his mighty aid implore.

CHORUS [sung after each voice]
Call! (And he will) he will answer thee,
Call! (and he will) he will answer thee,
Call and he will answer thee
With life for evermore.

2.
Hast thou wandered from thy home?
Dost thou in the desert roam?
Hear him gently saying "come,"
And his wondrous love adore.

3.
Is the life with care oppressed?
Does thou seek in vain for rest?
Come to him, and be thou blest.
And know sorrow nevermore.
