To Mary and Sarah.
"Mary of the Glen" (1852)
Words by Charles G. Eastman, Esq.
Music by George Frederick Root

Has any body spoke for you
Mary of the Glen?
Is there a heart that's broke for you
Mary of the Glen?
I have lands and I have leases,
I have gold and cattle too,
I have sheep with finest fleeces,
Can I marry you?

Nobody sir, has spoke for me
Mary of the Glen,
There is no heart that's broke for me
Mary of the Glen.
But there is blue-eyed Willie
Who labors with the men,
Who brings the sweet pond lily
To Mary of the Glen.

He has neither lands nor leases
But his cheek is cherry red
And finer than your fleeces,
Are the curls upon his head.
And tho' he's never spoke for me,
I know he loves me true.
And his heart would be broke for me,
If I should marry you.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I cannot marry you.
