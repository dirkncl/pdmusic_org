"Pass Not By" (1875)
Words by Mrs. E. C. Kinney
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Jesus, Saviour! pass not by,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Lo! we join, as one, to cry,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Lord, fulfill Thy promise now,
Pour Thy Spirit while we bow:
Turn to us, as one we cry,
Pass not by, pass not by!

2.
We have heard Thy footsteps near,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Pause, behold, the pleading tear,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Jesus, Saviour, come at last,
Lest, in blessing, we be pass'd;
When Thy Spirit is so nigh,
Pass not by, pass not by!

3.
Prostrate in Thy path we lie,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Lest our very faith should die,
Pass not by, pass not by!
To Thy garments we will cling,
All our need before Thee bring;
Son of Davidm hear our cry,
Pass not by, pass not by!

4.
Lord, we cannot let Thee go,
Pass not by, pass not by!
In our midst Thy presence show,
Pass not by, pass not by!
Breathe, O breathe on us, we pray!
Tarry not, Lord, come today.
While we wait, and watch and cry,
Pass not by, pass not by!
