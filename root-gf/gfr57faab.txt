1.
Flee as a bird to your mountain,
Thou who art weary of sin;
Go to the clear flowing fountain,
Where you may wash an be clean;
Fly, for th'avenger is near thee;
Call and the Saviour will hear thee,
He on his bosom will bear thee,
Thou who art weary of sin.
O thou, who art weary of sin.

2.
He will protect thee for ever,
Wipe ev'ry falling tear;
He will forsake thee, O never,
Sheltered so tenderly there;
Haste, then, the hours are flying,
Spend but the moments in sighing,
Cease from your sorrow and crying,
The Saviour will wipe ev'ry tear,
The Saviour will wipe ev'ry tear.
