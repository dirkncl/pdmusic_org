1. I am weeping over thy grave, Mabel,
Where the willow boughs droop low;
’Tis the spot where oft we have met, Mabel,
In the years of long ago.
’Twas evil, the day that we met, Mabel,
Thy path had been strewn with flowers,
But I sowed the seeds of regret, Mabel,
To spring up in future hours.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Mabel, Mabel, my beautiful palebrowed wife!
Thou art sleeping alone
’Neath the granite stone,
While I live with a darken’d life.

2. It was ill, the day that we wed, Mabel,
From thy girlhood pure and bright;
Thy young life was too soon led, Mabel,
To sorrow, and shame, and blight!
I burdened thy spirit with woe, Mabel,
’Till hope from thy heart was driven;
Then the burden lifted, and thou, Mabel,
To thy rest called home to heaven.

3. It was well for thee to depart, Mabel,
But for me ’twas bitter woe,
And a darkness fell on my heart, Mabel,
At the call which forced thee to go.
By liquor’s fell power enslav’d, Mabel,
All homeless and lost I roam.
Yet I’m glad to know thou art saved, Mabel,
From the fallen drunkard’s home.
