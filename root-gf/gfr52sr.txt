1.
Oh, where are you going sweet Robin,
What makes you sae proud and sae shy?
I once saw the day, little Robin,
My friendship you would not deny.
But winter again is returning,
And weather both stormy and snell;
If you will come back little Robin,
I'll feed you wi' moulins mysel'.

CHORUS
Oh, where are you go-ing, sweet Robin,
What makes you sae proud and sae shy?
I once saw the day, little Robin,
My friendship you would not deny.

2.
When summer comes in, little Robin,
Forgets all his friends and his care;
Away in the fields flies sweet Robin,
To wander the groves here and there.
Though you be my debtor, sweet Robin,
On you I will never lay blame,
For I've had as dear friends as Robin
Who often have served me the same.

(CHORUS)
