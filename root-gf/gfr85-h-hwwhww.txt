1.
Here we watch, here we wait, for thy coming, blessed Lord;
Here we watch, here we wait, for thee;
We are poor, we are weak, but we claim thy promised word,
That amid thy people thou wilt ever be.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come, Lord Jesus, to thy waiting children now;
Come, O come, while before thy throne we bow;
And, O Lord, while we seek here thy pardon and thy grace,
May we see with joy thy reconciled face.

2.
Here we wait, here we hope, for thy power, mighty King;
Here we hope for thy pow'r to save;
Tho' so poor and so weak, to thy promise still will cling,
And with earnest hearts this gift of gifts we crave.

3.
Wilt thou heed now our cry, wilt thou meet us, blessed Lord,
While we watch here and wait for thee?
May we hear, may we ponder the precepts of thy word,
And within its depths a heavenly glory see.
