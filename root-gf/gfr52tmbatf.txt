1. Young maybells ring throughout the vale,
And sound so sweet and clear;
The dance begins, ye flowers all
Come with a merry cheer,
The flowers red and white and blue
Merrily flock around;
Forgetmenot, of heavenly hue,
And violet, too, abound.

CODA 1
Young maybells ring throughout the vale,
And sound so sweet and clear;
The dance begins, ye flowers all
Come with a merry cheer,
Come with a merry cheer.

2. Young Maybells play a spritely tune, 
And all begin to dance,
While o’er them smiles the gentle moon
With her soft silvery glance;
This Master Frost offended sore,
He in the vale appeared—
Young Maybells ring the dance no more—
Gone are the flowers seared.

CODA 2
Young Maybells play a spritely tune, 
And all begin to dance,
While o’er them smiles the gentle moon
With her soft silvery glance,
With her soft silvery glance.


3. But Frost has scarcely talen flight, 
When wellknown sounds I hear,
The Maybells with renewed delight
Are ringing doubly clear;
Now I no more can stay at home,
The Maybells call me, too,
The flowers to the dance all roam,
Then why should I not go?

CODA 3
But Frost has scarcely talen flight, 
When wellknown sounds I hear,
The Maybells with renewed delight
Are ringing doubly clear,
Are ringing doubly clear.
