"Call 'Em Names, Jeff." (1862)
Words by R. Tompkins
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Said Beauregard, to Lee, and Jeff.
 "These Yankees sons of thunder,
Will scatter us from right to left,
 Or us to knock under,
Unless we find some other way
 Of meeting their advances;
We've made up faces now so long,
 They do not mind our glances."

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
They do not
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
They do not mind our glances.

2.
O true said Jeff. I know it well,
 How shall we change our game, sir,
"O dear," said Lee, "I cannot tell."
 Quoth Beau, "we'll call 'em names, sir."
"That's good," said Jeff. "you've hit it Beau."
 Cried Lee, "that's what's the matter;"
"We'll call them 'Abolutionists,'
 And then you'll see them scatter."

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
And then you'll
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
And then you'll see them scatter.

3.
They rubb'd their traitor hands in glee,
 And issued stringent orders,
Signed by the polite Beauregard,
 That, henceforth through their borders,
The only word that should be used,
 To name the Yankee soldier,
Should be an 'Abolutionist,'
 And then they strutted bolder.

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
And then they
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
And then they strutted bolder.

4.
They really thought that calling names,
 Had strengthen'd their position,
When all their sneaking curs up North,
 Ran yelping Abolition;
But soon we made the traitors know,
 'Twas something else the matter,
The more they 'Abolution' howl'd,
 The more we did not scatter.

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
The more we
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
The more we did not scatter.

5.
We take the name your gave us, Beau,
 We mean to make it true, sir,
We'll first abolish Slavery's power,
 And then abolish you, sir.
You thought we'd guard your niggers, Jeff.
 And keep them raising corn, sir,
To feed the traitor hordes you lead;
 We'll do it 'in a horn sir.'

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
We'll do it
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
We'll do it 'in a horn sir.'

6.
We'll free your blacks and fight your whites
 And dig for traitors, graves, sir,
Until there's not in all the land
 A traitor or a slave, sir;
When that is done, we'll home return,
 The home to us so dear, sir,
And soundly kick and cuff the curs,
 Now barking in our rear, sir.

Chorus
Ha, ha,
Ha, ha,
Now barking
ha, ha, 
ha, ha, ha
Now barking in our rear, sir.
