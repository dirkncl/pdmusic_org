"Out on the Prairie" (1877)
Words and Music
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
(from page 27 of "The New Song Era")

1.
Out on the prairie,
Out on the prairie,
Out on the prairie,
There is where I dwell;
To the crowded city,
To the crowded city,
To the busy throng,
I say farewell.


2.
Sweet is the prairie,
Sweet is the prairie,
Sweet is the prairie,
In its robe of green.
In the crowded city,
In the crowded city,
Nothing half so beau-
tiful is seen.

3.
Come to the prairie,
Come to the prairie,
Come to the prairie,
Reaching far and wide.
Leave the crowded city,
Leave the crowded city,
Leave the busy throng,
And all its pride.
