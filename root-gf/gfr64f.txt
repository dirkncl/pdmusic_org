"Lay Me Down and Save the Flag" (1864)
Last words of the hero MULLIGAN.
Song & Chorus.
Words by "Paulina"
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
They arose, whose name was Legion,
As an overwhelming wave,
And the battle surged its billows
Round a chosen few and grave;
And they neared the sacred banner,
With their foul and flaunting rag,
When the dying hero shouted,
"Lay me down and save the Flag."

CHORUS
So he fell, the brave commander,
Like the oak from mountain crag;
But his last words still are ringing,
"Lay me down and save the Flag."

2.
To the Siroc of Secession,
They had bared the fearless brow --
They had heard that voice and heeded --
Could they hear and heed it now?
But his heart is in the battle --
Shall the hallowed ensign drag,
While a hand is left to rescue?
"Lay me down and save the Flag."

(CHORUS)

3.
Then they looked at one another
In the speechlessness of woe,
As each eye would ask a brother,
Shall we stay, or shall we go?
And again the sight was blasted
By the traitor's boastful rag,
And again the word fell sternly,
"Lay me down and save the Flag."

(CHORUS)

4.
Oh, belov-ed, ye who murmur
For the dear ones gone before,
For the manly son and brother,
That may greet you nevermore;
For the loving arm that shielded,
For the hope whose pinions lag,
Let the lips that quiver, falter,
"Lay me down and save the Flag."

CHORUS last time
Slumber calmly, brave commander,
Where thou art no pinions lag,
Fame will hear thy words forever,
"Lay me down and save the Flag."
