1. 
There is a sweet romantic spot 
Down by the Hudson side, 
Where here and there a rustic cot 
Peeps thro’ the trees with pride; 
Should Cupid pass this scene so dear, 
Tho’ arm’d with shaft and bow, 
He’d leave his heart in bondage here, 
With charming, charming Annie Lowe.

CHORUS
1. 
Oh, Annie Lowe! sweet Annie Lowe, 
The zephyrs when they sigh’d 
To steal a kiss have with the bliss 
Upon thy sweet lips died.

2. 
I’ve rov’d in many a distant clime 
Beyond my own blue sea, 
Where pleasure clips the wing of time, 
With love and minstrelry; 
Yet then I felt the stream of pride 
Within my bosom flow, 
As mem’ry brought back Hudson side 
And charming, charming Annie Lowe.

CHORUS
1. 
Oh, Annie Lowe! sweet Annie Lowe, 
The zephyrs when they sigh’d 
To steal a kiss have with the bliss 
Upon thy sweet lips died.
