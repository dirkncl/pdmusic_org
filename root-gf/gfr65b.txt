"On, On, On, The Boys Come Marching!" (1865)
or "The Prisoner Free"
(Sequel to "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp")
Words and Music by George Frederick Root

1.
O! the day it came at last,
When the glorious tramp was heard,
And the boys were marching fifty thousand strong,
And we grasped each others' hands,
Tho' we uttered not a word,
As the booming of our cannon rolled along!

CHORUS
On, on, on, the boys came marching,
Like a grand majestic sea,
And they dashed away the guard,
From the heavy iron door,
And we stood beneath the starry banner, free.

2.
O! the feeblest heart grew strong,
And the most despondent, sure,
When we heard the thrilling sounds we loved so well,
For we knew that want and woe,
We no longer should endure,
When the hosts of freedom reached our prison cell!

(CHORUS)

3.
O! the war is over now,
And we're safe at home again,
And the cause we starved and suffer'd for, is won,
But we never can forget,
'Mid our woe and 'mid our pain,
How the glorious Union boys came tramping on!

(CHORUS)
