"Love Wakes and Weeps" (1864)
No. 414 from "The Musical Curriculum"
Words and Music by
George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

Love wakes and weeps
While Beauty sleeps!
O for the Music's softest numbers,
To prompt a theme,
For Beauty's dream,
Soft as pillow of her slumbers!
Through groves of palm,
Sigh gales of balm,
Fire-flies on the air are wheeling;
While through the gloom
Comes soft perfume,
The distant beds of flowr's revealing.
O wake and live!
No dream can give
A shadow'd bliss the zeal excelling;
No longer sleep,
From lattice peep,
And list the tale that love is telling;
And list the tale that love is telling.
