Dedicated to Henry Wood
"Fare Thee Well Kitty Dear" (1852)
Written expressly performed by Wood's Minstrels
Composed by George Frederick Root

1.
I saw the smile of evening die
In beauty on a southern sky
And as I mark'd that fatty scene
So mild, so lovely and serene,
A strange wild sound forever clear,
In tones like these I chanc'd to hear.

CHORUS
Fare the well Kitty dear!
Thou art sleeping in thy grave so low,
Never more Kitty dear,
Will thou listen to my old banjo.
Fare thee well Kitty,
Fare thee well Kitty,
Fare thee well Kitty dear,
Fare thee well Kitty,
Fare thee well Kitty,
Fare thee well Kitty dear,

2.
Tho' Afric's son that strain awoke,
A language to my soul it spoke,
That seem'd my restless thoughts to quell,
And hold me captive to its spell;
How much of feeling deep and strong
Was blended in that artless song.

(CHORUS)

3.
Tho' years since then have pass'd away,
The echo of that simple day
Comes o'er me when with care oppress'd,
And soothe my troubled heart to its rest;
Nor will I 'till my latest hour
Forget the magic of its pow'r.

(CHORUS)
