"The Hazel Dell" (1853)
by George Frederick Root

1.
In the Hazel Dell my Nelly's sleeping,
Nelly lov'd so long!
And my lonely lonely watch I'm keeping,
Nellie lost and gone;
Here in moonlight often we have wander'd
Thro' the silent shade,
Now where leafy branches drooping downward,
Little Nelly's laid.

CHORUS
All alone my watch I'm keeping
In the Hazel Dell,
For my darling Nelly's near me sleeping,
Nelly dear farewell.

2.
In the hazel dell my Nelly's sleeping,
Where the flowers wave,
And the silent stars are nightly weeping,
O'er poor Nelly's grave;
Hopes that once my bosom fondly cherish'd
Smile no more for me,
Ev'y dream of joy alas has perish'd,
Nelly dear with thee.

(CHORUS 'pp')

3.
Now I'm weary, friendless and foresaken,
Watching here alone,
Nelly thou no more will fondly cheer me,
With thy loving tone;
Yet forever shall thy gentle image
In my mem'ry dwell,
And my tears thy lonely grave shall moisten,
Nelly dear, farewell.

(CHORUS)
