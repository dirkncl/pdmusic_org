"Only Waiting" (1859)
by George Frederick Root

---
A very aged christian who was so poor as to be in an alms house was
asked what he was doing, He replied "Only waiting."

1.
Only waiting till the shadows
Are a little longer grown;
Only waiting till the glimmer
Of the day's last beam is flown;
Till the night of earth is faded
From the heart once full of day;
Till the stars of heav'n are breaking
Thro' the twilight soft and gray,
Only waiting, Only waiting.

2.
Only waiting till the reapers
Have the last sheaf gather'd home,
For the summer time is faded,
And the autumn winds have come,
Quickly, reapers, gather quickly
The last ripe hours of my heart.
For the bloom of life is withered,
And I hasten to depart,
Only waiting, Only waiting.

3.
Only waiting till the angels
Open wide the mystic gate,
At whose feet I long have lingered,
Weary poor and desolate,
Even now I hear the footsteps,
And their voices far away;
If they call me, I am waiting,
Only waiting to obey,
Only waiting, Only waiting.

4.
Only waiting till the shadows
Are a little longer grown,
Only waiting till the glimmer
Of the day's last beam is flown;
Then from out the gather'd darkness,
Holy, deathless stars shall rise,
By whose light my soul shall gladly
Tread its pathway to the skies,
Only waiting, Only waiting.
