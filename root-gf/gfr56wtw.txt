"Dearest Spot of Earth to Me Is Home" (1856)
by William Thomas Wrighton, 1816-1880
Arranged as a Quartette for
Soprano Alto Tenor & Bass
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1. The dearest spot of earth to me
Is home, sweet home,
The fairy land I've longed to see
Is home, sweet home,
There how charm'ed the sense of hearing,
There where hearts are so endearing
All the world is not so cheering
As home, sweet home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The dearest spot for me
is home (is home), sweet home.
The fairy land I've longed to see
is home (is home), sweet home.

2. I've taught my heart the way to prize,
My home, sweet home,
I've learned to look with lover's eyes
On home, sweet home,
There where vows are truly plighted,
There where hearts are so united
All the world besides I've slighted
For home sweet home.
