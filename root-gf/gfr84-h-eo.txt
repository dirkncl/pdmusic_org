1.
Oh, the Savior's mighty hand can save Ev'ry one!
'Twas for all his precious blood he gave, Ev'ry one;
Ev'ry one whose feet are falling,
'Mid life's dangers oft appalling,
Ev'ry one his voice is calling, 
Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one.

2.
Oh, we know his Spirit now is near Ev'ry one!
And his tender love inviting here, Ev'ry one;
Ev'ry one, tho' long delaying,
Ev'ry one, tho' sadly straying,
Ev'ry one, tho' disobeying,
Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one.

3.
Blessed Savior, help us now to come, Ev'ry one!
Thro' the wilderness, oh, bring us home, Ev'ry one;
Ev'ry one, to life eternal,
Ev'ry one, to pastures vernal,
Ev'ry one, to joys supernal,
Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one (Only hear), Ev'ry one.
