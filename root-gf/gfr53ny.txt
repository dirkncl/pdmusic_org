1. Come let us anew 
Our journey pursue— 
Roll round with the year. 
And never stand still till 
the Master appear. 
And never stand still 
till the Master appear.

2. His adorable will 
Let us gladly fulfil. 
And our  taltents improve. 
By the patience of hope, 
and the labor or love. 
By the patience of love 
and the labor of love.
