1. Ah! now they fall in millions,
The raindrops all around,
They’re dancing on the housetops,
They’re hiding in the ground;
They’re fairylike musicians
With anything for keys,
The roof, the doors, the windows,
The fences and the trees.

2. A light and airy treble,
They place upon the stream,
And then the tune is quiet,
Like music in a dream;
Anon the base is sounding
Within the forest caves,
With alto from the zephyrs,
And tenor from the waves.

3. Oh! ’tis a storm of music, 
And Robbins don’t intrude,
If when the rain is weary,
They pine an interlude;
It seems as if the warbling
Of birds in all the bowers
Had gathered into raindrops,
And come to us in showers.
