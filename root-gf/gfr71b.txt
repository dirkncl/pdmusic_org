"Lost and Saved" (1871)
Song and Chorus.
Words and Music by
George Frederick Root

1.
Fairer than the lily,
Sweeter than the rose,
Was our little darling,
at that autumn twilight's close;
Sweetly she was sleeping
In the angels care,
When we joined the footsteps thronging
to the house of prayer.

CHORUS
Strange were the sounds when the service was through,
Fierce the red glare that then burnt on our view,
Dreadful words that rose higher and higher,
Lost in the Fire! Lost in the Fire!

2.
Quick we hasten'd homeward,
But the flames were there,
And the frighten'd crowd were surging
here and ev'ry where;
Oh, my precious darling,
Who can save her now,
For the roof is burning, and the
chimneys away and bow.

CHORUS
Still the strange words when the service was through,
Still the fierce glare bursting red on our view.
Still the dread words rising higher and higher,
Lost in the Fire! Lost in the Fire!

3.
When, oh sight of rapture?
At the open door,
Stood the little feet on the
hard and heated floor,
"Mama, come and take me,
They said you were here,"
Then we knew the angels saved her,
for none else were near.

CHORUS
What tho' the sounds rush'd the wide city through,
What tho' the glare was bright in our view,
Chang'd were the words that rose higher and higher,
Saved from the Fire! Saved from the Fire!
