1.
Go, when the morning shineth,
Go, when the noon is bright,
Go, when the eve declineth,
Go, in the hush of night;
Go, with an humble feeling,
Put earthly tho'ts away,
And to the Master kneeling,
Do thou in secret pray.

2.
Think thee of all who love thee,
All who are loved by thee;
Pray too, for those who hate thee,
If any such there be;
Then for thyself in meekness,
Humbly a blessing claim,
Blending with each petition
Thy great Redeemer's name.

3.
Or, if tis e'er denied thee,
In solitude to pray;
Should holy tho'ts come o'er thee,
When friends are round thy way;
E'n then, the silent breathing
Thy spirit lifts above,
Will reach his throne of glory
Where dwells eternal love.
