"The People's Choice" (1884)
Words by Collin Coe.
Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895.
[same music as his "The First Gun Is Fired!" (1861)]
from "Blaine & Logan Republican Campaign Songs"

1.
The strife now begins!
May God protect the right,
Let the patriot sons of land arise
In power's victorious might!
Shall the glorious party that long has ruled,
By ruthless hands be sundered,
And we who saved the nation's fame,
Of our good work be plunder'd?

[REFRAIN]
Arise! Arise! Arise!
And shout with joyful voice,
"We'll vote for Blaine, the man from Maine,
For he's the people's choice."

CHORUS
Arise! Arise! Arise!
And gird ye for the fight
And vote for Blaine, the man from Maine,
For he's the people's choice.


2.
The strife now begins!
Its echos thrill the land,
And the bounding hearts of the patriot throng,
Now firmly take their stand!
We will bravely work for the man from Maine,
The statesman wise and gifted,
And to the highest, sacred rights
By us he shall be lifted!

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
The strife now begins!
Oh! heed the signal well,
And the thunder tone as it rolls along
Shall joyful tidings tell!
Our Republican arm is mighty still,
Its strength shall fail us never!
That strength we'll give to our righteous cause
And our glorious land forever!

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
