1.
Angels long have pass'd and gone
While I've hung alone upon the wall so strong;
Marking still the hours that glide,
In the old neglected corner where I hide.
||: Here have joyous words been told,
Here have youthful forms grown old;
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Swinging all day long. :||

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Happy happy days of yore,
Vanished to return no more!
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Singing all day long.
(Swinging,) Swinging,
(swinging,) swinging,
swinging all day long.

2.
Neath the Old Oak's rustic shade
Oft in happy inocence the young have play'd;
And these ancient walls have rung,
With the artless melody by children sung.
||: Happy, happy days of yore,
Vanish'd to return no more;
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Swinging all day long. :||

3.
Whe the winter's night was drear,
Fond delight and gentle peace still linger'd here,
For the storm, tho' wild its mirth
Could not reach the quiet home, the social hearth.
||: Happy, happy days of yore,
Vanish'd to return no more;
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Swinging all day long. :||

4.
Here hath love in accents gay,
Breath'd in softly winning tones his captive lay,
And the list'ning maiden's cheek
Were 'a flush that told the thought she dared not speak.
||: Happy, happy days of yore,
Vanish'd to return no more;
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Swinging all day long. :||

5.
Thus have ages past and gone,
While I've hung alone upon the wall so strong,
And the young and joyous sleep
In the silent grave where love and mem'ry weep.
||: Happy, happy days of yore,
Vanish'd to return no more;
Still I sing my ceaseless song,
Swinging all day long. :||
