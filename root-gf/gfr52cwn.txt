1.
Chant we now a mournful anthem,
Now a parting song we bring;
Blend once more our youthful voices,
While a dirge-like strain we sing.
Tears are from our eyelids falling,
Wildly throbs each saddened heart!
Sisters, from these scenes we're going;
Sisters, we are doomed to part.

2.
Softly swell the numbers,
Gently on the breeze they float;
Grief from its slumbers,
Waking each note.
Gone are now fair childhood's hours,
With the laughing lip and brow;
From our path have fled the flowers,
Woman's lot is on us now;
From our path have fled the flowers,
Woman's lot is on us now;

3.
Sisters, we have walked together,
'Neath the skies of sunny years;
In the dim and mystic future,
Lies there not a vale of tears?
Yet the star of Faith will guide us,
O'er our spirits cast a spell.
Lead us to a fairer haven,
never more to breathe farewell,
Never more, never more, to breathe farewell,
never more (to breathe farewell,)
never more (to breathe farewell,)
never more (to breathe farewell,)
never more (to breathe farewell,)
to breathe farewell.

While a dirge-like strain we sing.
Tears are from our eyelids falling,
Wildly throbs each saddened heart,
From these much-loved scenes we're going;
We from hence are doomed to part,
From these much-loved scenes we're going;
We from hence are doomed to part,

Schoolmates we have walked together,
'Neath the skies of sunny years;
In the dim and mystic future,
Lies there not a vale of tears?
Lies there not a vale of tears?
Yet the star of Faith will guide us,
O'er our spirits cast a spell,
Lead us to a fairer haven,
Nevermore to breathe farewell,
Lead us to a fairer haven,
Nevermore to breathe farewell.

Never more to say farewell,
Nevermore to say farewell;
Lead us to a fairer haven,
Nevermore to say farewell.
