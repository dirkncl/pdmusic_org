"In Dreams I See My Mother" (1853)
Words by E. A. Perkins
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
In dreams I see my mother,
Her locks are silver'd grey,
I see upon her placid brow,
The cares of many a day,
Her eyes grow dim, her step is slow,
Her strength is failing fast,
Her voice is tremulous and low,
For youth's bright day is past.

CHORUS
O mother dear, O mother dear,
Our found hearts turn to thee,
Forever warm and true,
Forever warm and true,
Where e'er our lot may be.

2.
We knelt in childhood by her side,
To say our evening prayer,
Her gentle voice was then our guide,
It soothed each little care,
But as at night the weary dove
Flies to her mountain nest,
She winged her way to heav'n above,
With angels there to rest.

(CHORUS)

3.
If then you have a mother dear,
O love her while you may,
She will not always linger here,
For soon she'll pass away,
Her joys we know not how to prize,
'Till from us she is riven,
And like an angel from the skies,
Points us the way to heav'n.

(CHORUS)
