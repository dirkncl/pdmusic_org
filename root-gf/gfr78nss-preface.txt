The aim of the NATIONAL SCHOOL SINGER is to supply the following wants in day-
    schools:

    1st.  A book convenient in size and price.
    2d.   Songs of Study, Order, Promptness, Obedience, and kindred subjects, so constructed
as to have a direct bearing upon the difference "situations" in the school-room where music
would be appropriate and helpful.
    3d.  Song-lessons, Excercise songs, and Vacation songs.
    4th.  Songs of Home, Industry, and Nature.
    5th.  Patriotic songs, Temperance songs, and songs for anniversary occasions.
    6th.  Opening and Closing songs.
    7th.  Hymns for Devotional Exercises.

    That these songs may not be limited in their use to special occasions, they are distrubuted
through the book.  WHen wanted for other purposes that the regular school-singing, they
can easily be selected.
    We have secured the services of competent persons in the preparation of this work, as
will readily be seen, and we send forth it in the full belief that it will be a decided helpt to
to cause of "Music in Schools."
