1.
Come, our long expected Jesus,
Born to set thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come, come, come Lord Jesus,
Born to set Thy people free;
Come, and from our sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.

2.
Israel's strength and consolation,
Hope of all the saints Thou art;
Dear Desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

3.
Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child, and yet a King,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy precious kingdom bring.

4.
By Thine own eternal spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all-sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
