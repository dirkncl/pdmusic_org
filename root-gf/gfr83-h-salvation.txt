1.
Oh hear the Savior calling, yes, calling to thy heart,
Forsake the ways of Satan, and choose the better part;
Why grovel here in sadness? there's joy reserved for thee,
On Calvary was completed, _Salvation full and free_.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Free full Salvation!
Repeat it o're and o'er,
In heaven a crown of glory,
And life forevermore.

2.
Oh see thy Savior waiting, yes, waiting at the door,
Has waited long and patient, oh will you grieve Him more?
In gentle tones of pity, He welcomes to His breast,
"Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest."

3.
Oh hark! thy Savior's pleading, yes, pleading with thee now,
His precious blood, His Spirit, the sweat upon his brow;
Oh He is willing, waiting, thy precious soul to save;
No cross on earth for Jesus, no crown beyond the grave.
