1.
Now I am old and my locks are gray,
The summer of youth bright and fair,
Calls me no more with its sunshine gay,
And merry hues it used to wear;
Still I look back on my childhood hours,
When free as a wild bird strayed,
Life was a garden of fairest flowers,
I thought would never, never fade.

CHORUS [sung after verses 1 & 2 only]
But I'm looking upward, and no more I'll sigh,
While I am waiting for the glorious day;
I know is coming bye and bye.

2.
Youth with its dreams of ambition came,
I welcom'd their smiles with delight,
Eager I turned where the star of fame,
Shone forth in distance clear and bright;
Quickly, to quickly the vision fled,
The laurels that gaily it wore,
Withered and sere o'er my path were spread,
Alas their beauties all were o'er.

3.
Now I am old and my locks are gray,
The summer of youth bright and fair,
Calls me no more with its sunshine gay,
And merry hues it used to wear;
And tho' the winter of age may blow,
Sweet mem'ries of joy linger yet,
Cheering me on as they murmur low,
In tones the heart can ne'er forget.

CHORUS [sung after verse 3 only]
Yes I'm looking upward, and no more I'll sigh,
While I am waiting for the glorious day;
I know is coming bye and bye.
