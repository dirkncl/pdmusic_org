"Foes and Friends" (1866)
Words by Hellen H. Flagg
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Two soldiers, lying as they fell,
Upon the reddened clay,
In daytime foes, at night in peace,
Breathed there their lives away;
Brave hearts had stirr'd each manly breast,
Fate, only, made them foes,
And lying, dying, side by side,
A softened feeling rose.

CHORUS
They'll go no more to the loved homes here,
But together both will wait
For the sunny-haired and bright-eyed anew,
Beyond the golden gate.

2.
"Among New Hampshire's snowy hills.
There pray for me tonight.
A woman and a little girl,
With hair like golden light!"
And at the thought, broke forth at last
The cry of anquish wild,
That would not longer be oppressed,
"O God, my wife, my child!"

(CHORUS)

3.
Then spoke the other dying man:
"Across the Georgia plain,
There watch and wait for me, loved ones
I'll never see again;
A little girl, with dark bright eyes,
Each day is at the door,
The father's step, the father's kiss,
Will never meet her more."

(CHORUS)

4.
The dying lips the pardon breathe,
The dying hands entwine;
The last ray dies, and over all
The stars of heaven shine,
And now, the girl with golden hair,
And she with dark eyes bright,
On Hampshire's hills, and Georgia's plain,
Were fatherless that night.

(CHORUS)
