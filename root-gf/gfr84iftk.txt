1.
[PRELUDE]
'Tis a gracious invitation from the King;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
'Tis a message full of kindness that we bring;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
[QUARTET]
Ho! ev'ry one that thirsteth;
Come ye to the water!
Come, come, come, without money and without price!
Incline your ear, and come unto me.
Hear, and your soul shall live.

CHORUS
'Tis a gracious invitation from the King!
We will hear, we will hear;
And the blessed words of mercy that you bring
We will hear, we will hear.

2.
[PRELUDE]
Still another invitation from the King;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
'Tis a message full of patience that we bring;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
[QUARTET]
Behold I stand at the door and knock;
If any man hear my voice, and open the door,
I will come in to him,
I will come in to him,
and will sup with him and he with me,
and he with me.

(CHORUS)

3.
[PRELUDE]
Once again an invitation from the King;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
'Tis a message full of mercy that we bring;
Will you hear? Will you hear?
[QUARTET]
Now is th'accepted time, now is the day of salvation,
Today if ye will hear His voice harden not your heart.
Come, while it is called today;
Come, while is is called today;
Now is th'accepted time, and now is the day of salvation.

(CHORUS)
