1.
Clear as crystal flows the river
From the throne of God above;
'Tis the water prure, of eternal life,
From the Fount of endless love.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Clear as crystal, clear as crystal
May thy truth forever be;
Clear as crystal, clear as crystal,
In our hearts, O Lord, from thee.

2.
Clear as crystal, like a jasper,
Is the heav'nly city's light,
As the wall appears, and the pearly gates--
To the pilgrim's ravished sight.

3.
Clear as crystal, is the wondrous
Sea of glass before the throne,
Where the joyful cry rises day and night
To the glorious Three in One.
