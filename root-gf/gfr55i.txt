"The Magic of a Kindly Smile" (1855)
by George Frederick Root

1.
As through this changing world we stray
And share alike its hopes and pains
How many a bright and gladsome ray
Amid its varying scenes appears
A cheerful look a gentle tone
The darkest moment may beguile
Where is the heart that hath not known
The magic of a kindly smile
The magic of a kindly smile.

2.
Nor for ourselves alone we live
A higher nobler aim is ours
The hand of friendly aid to give
And strew each others path with flowers
The heart its dreary lot may mourne
Oppressed with anxious thought the while
But oh its toils are lightly borne
If soft'ned by a kindly smile
If soft'ned by a kindly smile.


3.
Tis but a little thing to breathe
A word of kindness as we go
And yet that simple word may leave
A balm to heal a secret woe
And though from ev'ry sorrow free
we drink of pleasures cup the while
That heart must cold and selfish be
That does not prize a kindly smile
That does not prize a kindly smile.
