1. Sad as the music low and dim,
That comes from the seashell lone,
Swell the parting note of a funeral hymn,
For the spirit ever gone.
Father! thou a soul hast taken,
Left our hearts dark and forsaken;
One more earthly course is run;
God of love, thy will be done!

2. Soft as the lay the woodbird sings,
When the light of day is gone,
And eve hath veiled all earthly things,
Be our requiem for the dead.
Father! thou most kind, most holy!
Bend me to thee, meekly, lowly;
Thou hast called a cheished one,
God of love, thy will be done!
