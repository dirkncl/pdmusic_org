    The last page of music has gone to the printer, and so has the index and the title, and it only remains to write the preface to finish my part of "The Sabbath Bell;" to close up a work extending back through several years; a work associated with many happy hours, and a few sad ones; a work of great responsibility to the author, since it intends to supply a means for the worship of God, and a means for improving and ennobling the heart of the affections by that which is "pure and lovely, and of good report."

    The "Sabbath Bell" is divided into parts, in order that music for various purposes may be used appropriately, and especially that music for the singing-school, concert-room, or extraordinary occasions may not be used through inadvertence in the ordinary service of the sanctuary, doing harm rather than good by its display or inappropriateness.

    Attention is respectfully called to the singing-school department, which has been prepared with great care and labor. The plan is new, and music and words, almost without exception, original. It is believed that the character of the music, and the progressiveness and variety of the excercises will make the singing-school unusually pleasant and profitable both the the Teacher and Pupils. It is thought that choirs will find in the second department of this book a rich and fill supply for their part of the service for the Sabbath day, and the Editor would take this opportunity to experess his obligation to the "Plymouth Collection," from which, by the kindness of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, have been taken many beautiful hymns never before set to music; also to Dr. Lowell Mason, for permission to select from his manuscripts many valuable tunes which have never before been published.

    Many have complained that in the best and most popular of the later books a great amount of space is taken in reprinting the old tunes; at the same time it is admitted that they may not be dispensed with. It is hoped that the way that the matter is compromised in "The Sabbath Bell" will be approved. Chants for the services of the Episcopal Church have been prepared with much care, and we hope that may not be set aside because the words have not been placed under the music, for we are confident that a very little practice will enable a singer to read as well the music and worlds a little separated. The third department will be found to contain music for very many of those extraordinary occasions in which singing has a part, as well as far the more quiet enjoyment and devotion of that place "dearest to on on earth"â€”HOME.

    Finally, "The Sabbath Bell" is sent forth with the earnest prayer that is may serve well the cause of human improve- ment, both in that which releates to thia and that which relates to anther life, and to all who may use it may it be that when its last tone has floated away on the silent air, the stillness which follows shall only precede the bursting faith of the eter- nal song of "Mases and the Lamb."
