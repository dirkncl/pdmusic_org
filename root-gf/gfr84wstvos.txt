[This is a condensation of the overlapping
of the lyrics, without some minor variations.]

When shall the voice of singing, 
Flow joyfully along? 
When hill and valley ring, 
In one triumphant song, 
Proclaim to all the contest done, 
And He who once was slain, 
Again to earth descended 
In righteousness to reign. 

Then from the craggy mountains,
The sacred shout shall fly,
And shady groves and fountains,
Shall echo their reply,
High tow’r and lowly dwelling,
Shall send the hymn around,
All hallelujah swelling,
In one eternal sound.
