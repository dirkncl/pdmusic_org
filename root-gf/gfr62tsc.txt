1. Ring out, ring out, sweet silver bells,
A joyous, joyous chime,
Your welcome music ever tells
A Saviour’s love divine.
With willing hearts and feet we bound
To God’s own house of prayer.
Thrice blessed is the gladsome sound
Now paling on the air.

2. Ring out, sweet bells, a happy strain,
Awake each tuneful voice
To praise His dear and holy name,
In Him let all rejoice.
We are the children of His love,
United may we live;
He stoops from His bright throne above,
To pity and forgive.

3. Ring our your free, inspiring call,
Sweet bells of silver tongue,
Before his footstool here we fall,
And breathe our grateful song;
To us ye speak of joys unseen,
Immortal life and light, [FINE]
A world of purity serene,
Where faith is changed to night.

[REPEAT 3rd Verse to FINE]
