1.
How it marches! the Flag of the Union,
The dear old Flag of the Union,
And our bosoms swell with pride,
While we see it floating wide
Over all as the Flag of the Union.

CHORUS
How it marches! the Flag of the Union,
The dear old Flag of the Union,
It shall float in pow'r and pride,
Over all the land so wide
Evermore as the Flag of the Union.

2.
Oh! our boys love the Flag of the Union,
The dear old Flag of the Union,
In the front of ev-ery fight,
'Mid the the battle's lurid light,
They have died for the Flag of the Union.

(CHORUS)

3.
Sailors, too, love the Flag of the Union,
The dear old Flag of the Union,
They have nailed it firm and fast
To the top of ev-ery mast,
For their joy is the Flag of the Union.

(CHORUS)

4.
Uncle Sam loves the Flag of the Union,
The dear old Flag of the Union,
And amid the loss we mourn,
Says in thunder tones so stern,
"All shall honor the Flag of the Union."

(CHORUS)
