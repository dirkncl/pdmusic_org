"The Beautiful Summer Is Coming" (1877)
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

1.
The beautiful summer is comming, comming,
Hear her song!
The bees in the meadow are humming, humming,
All day long.
The flowers are laughing her welcome, welcome,
When she goes,
The brooklet is leaping and shouting and dancing
Where'er it flows.

CHORUS 2 times
Come join in the praise of the summer sweet,
Arrayed in emerald green;
Oh hail, to her magical footsteps fleet,
Our queen, our beautiful queen.

2.
The birds in the woodland are winging, winging,
Nought to fear,
Or, high on the treetops are singing, singing,
Loud and clear.
All nature is giving her welcome,
Ev'ry where,
To beautifil summer, the queen of the seasons,
So glad and fair.

(CHORUS 2 times)
