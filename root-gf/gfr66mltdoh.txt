"Mournfully Lay the Dead One Here" (1866)
(The Mason's Dirge)
Words by Robert Morris L.L.D.
Music by George Frederick Root

1.
Mournfully lay the dead one here,
And lovingly gather nigh,
Silently yield the tribute tear,
His dirge a tender sigh.
Our chain is broke, and life can ne'er
This fondest link supply,
Mournfully lay the dead one here,
And lovingly gather nigh.

2.
Ever his face was set to go,
Up toward Jerusalem,
Ever he walk'd and liv'd as though
He was its golden beam;
That place whose emblem was so dear,
Is now his home on high.
Mournfully lay the dead one here,
And lovingly gather nigh.
