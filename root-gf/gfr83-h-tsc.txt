1.
The Savior calls, let ev'ry ear,
Attend the heav'nly sound,
Ye doubting souls dismiss your fear,
True life may here be found.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Attend, (Attend,) attend, (attend,)
Attend the heav'nly sound,
Attend, (attend,) attend, (attend,)
True life may here be found.

2.
For ev'ry thirsty, longing heart,
Here streams of bounty flow;
And life and health and bliss impart,
To banish mortal woe.

3.
Here springs of sacred pleasure rise
To heal your ev'ry pain;
Immortal fountain, full supplies,
Nor shall you thirst in vain.
