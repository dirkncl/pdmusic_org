1. What think ye of Christ? O solemn word,
On which we stand or fall!
Who was the wondrous Being here,
Who died to save us all?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The Wonderful, the Counselor!
The great and mighty Lord!--
The everlasting Father he,
By all in heaven adored.

2. What think ye of Christ? to whom all power
In earth and heaven belongs?
Who as the King of Kings we praise
In loud and joyful songs?

3. What think ye of Christ? in whom is all
The fullness of our God?
Who as Immanuel our King,
With us on earth abode?

4. What think ye of Christ? do we in prayer,
Heed well his high behest?--
Come unto ME-- there's none beside,
To give the weary rest.
