"Farewell Beloved Friends, Farewell" (1871)
by George Frederick Root

1.
'Mid the scenes so bright and cheerful,
One sad strain we bring;
Joy is silent,
Love is tearful,
While our low "Farewell we sing, Farewell,
Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell,
Farewell, Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell.

2.
Coming days will not restore us
All we've found and cherish'd here;
But with radiant hopes before us
Smiles the future, bright and clear.
Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell,
Farewell, Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell.

3.
Oh! with faithful hearts and lovely,
May we meet the joy and strife;
Learning lessons pure and holy
From the open Book of life.
Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell,
Farewell, Farewell belov-ed friends, farewell.
