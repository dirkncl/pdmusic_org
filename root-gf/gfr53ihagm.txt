1.
I had a gentle mother; how oft in childhood's years,
She sooth'd my little troubles, and kiss'd away my tears;
With ev'ry wish I hastened, instinctive to her side,
Nor dream'd I could lose her, my constant, faithful guide,
Nor dream'd I could lose her, my constant, faithful guide.

2.
I had a praying mother; she led me to that shrine,
Whence drawing heav'nly wisdom, she taught me things divine;
Her lamp was trimm'd and burning, illuming all the way
That leads thro' Death's dark valley up to eternal day,
That leads thro' Death's dark valley up to eternal day.

3.
I've now an angel mother, for the hath left this land,
And found a better country-- a home at God's right hand;
Could she now see my sorrow, I know she'd pity me;
God help me to subdue it! least she my sin might see.

4.
O I had still a mother, I'd be more mild and meek;
I'd speak in kindly accents, as she was wont to speak.
But there are vain resolvings-- I'll try to prove more true
To those whom God hath spared me, ere they are angels too.
