EXPLANATORY.
------------
  It is expected that this cantata will commonly be given, book in
hand, as a concert but it may be given in costume with scenery and
appropriate action.  When that is done the following hints may be
of use.
  The stage should be set with an out-of-door country scene, and at
one side should appear the end of Farmer Meadows' house, with a door
for exit and entrance, and upper windows which can be thrown open by
Phyllis and Margaret during the serenade.
  Costumes may vary according to the tastes of the performers.  As
the situations are rustic, the dressing should be according to the surroundings; and in the case of the women, the more picturesque
the simple dresses are, the prettier will the scene appear.

  The Semi-Choruses are in three parts;---for the women's voices 1st
and 2d Soprano and Alto:---for the men, 1st and 2d Tenor and Base.
  Where semi-choruses are connected with the full chorus (as in No.

  The success of this Cantata will depend greatly upon the audience's
hearing all the words.  Come well to the front, sing directly and

No. 1. INTRODUCTION

==================================================
_When the curtain rises the full chorus, including the Farmer,
Douglas and Margaret, is discovered on the stage._

No. 2. THERE'S A TIME FOR WORK AND A TIME FOR PLAY
Chorus and Semi-Choruses.

[CHORUS]
There's a time for work and a time for play,---
Or so the wiseacres tell us;
And altho' we play with a right good will,
In work we are no less zealous.
Oh, alas! for those who must toil and slave
In stifled and narrow places;
Let our thanks ascend that our labors lie
'Mid Nature's ennobling graces,
'Mid Nature's ennobling graces.
[SEMI-CHORUS. Men]
If we drive the plough or we drop the seed,
Or thresh from the grain, its booty,
Tho' the work be hard, yet the spreading skies
Smile down and make light the duty.
[SEMI-CHORUS. Women]
And we skim the cream in the shining pans,
And churn into gold the butter,
While outside the window the blossoms bead,
And songsters their sweet notes utter,
And songsters their sweet notes utter.
[CHORUS]
Then when we hie in the village green,
For play we will all be ready,
There the lads and lassies, will trip it gay
To music both tuneful and steady.
Then the games will follow and food and drink
Will burden the tables to quaking,
And the jest will fly and the laughter ring
From hearts that are merry making,
From hearts that are merry making.

  FARMER.  Yes, friends, a healthy life in the country is the
happiest of all the lives that God gives to his creatures, and
although you have been invited here to-day to lend a helping
hand, I jope some enjoyingment may be mingled with the labor.
Margaret claims the lassies first for her quilting.
  MARGARET.  Yes, soon our needles must be flying.
  DOUGLAS.  And your tongues too, maybe.
  MARGARET.  I hope so, truly.  A sad affair would a quilting
bee appear, where tongues were mute.
  DOUGLAS.  That is a wonder that will never be seen I am sure;
and I have heard that sometimes the tongues are sharper than the
needles.
  MARGARET.  Fie, Douglas!  Do you suppose our tongues are any
sharper than yours?

==========================
_The women form as if on three sides of a quilting frame (the
open side to the audience) and at the Refrain make the motions
of weaving the needles and drawing up the threads as indicated
by the form of the melody._

No. 3. THE QUILTING FRAME.
Semi-Chorus. Women.

1.
The quilting frame is a cheerful place
With its hum of happy voices;
We gather round like bees indeed,
And the housewife's heart rejoices,
For in and out the needles fly
With long thread trailing after,
Till many lines all straightly lie
'Mid bursts of talk and laughter,
'Mid bursts of talk and laughter.

REFRAIN
Weave the needles keep the line,
Work and pleasure thus combine,
Lighten toil with harmless chatter,
What the men say does not matter.

SEMI-CHORUS. Men.
But woe to her who at home has stayed,
For her fate is now a sad one;
Her reputation as good housewife
Is gone, if she ever had one.
Her cooking is voted a failure, quite,
She can't even make good butter,
And the way she lets her children go
Brings tho'ts too deep to utter,
Brings tho'ts too deep to utter.
Sharp are the needles!
Sharper still the tongue!
O many are the victims that the quilting bee has stung,
has stung, has stung,
The quilting bee has stung.

2.
SEMI-CHORUS. Women
Then take the scissors that glitter bright,
Snip away with careful measures
The even thread with practiced hand,
For the perfect work's a pleasure;
The ends then take in fingers deft,
Tie them fast in knots enduring,
So shall the quilt a treasure be,
Sweet peace to us ensuring,
Sweet peace to us ensuring.

(REFRAIN)
(SEMI-CHORUS. Men.)

3.
SEMI-CHORUS. Women.
For shame, to think all you hear,
You're awfully mistaken,
Just listen while we're at our work,
And your consciouses will waken,
You'll ask our pardon with humble mien,
And then we will not flout you,
For after all you are only men,
And we know all about you,
Yes, we know all about you.

(REFRAIN)

  MARGARET.  Have done with nonsense. Here comes Phyllis.
(_Enter Phyllis._) I am going to let the child take her place
at the frames to-day if she likes. She scarecely knows the
meaning of the word gossip; and she will find that quilting
bees like other bees spend more time gathering honey than
using their stings.

=============================
_(Let the solo singers come well to the front and remember that
they are really singing to the audience and not to each other)._

No. 4. THE FIELDS OF RED CLOVER AND HUMMING CHORUS.
Duet. Phyllis and Margaret.

1.
The fields of red clover bend low in the breeze
That sweeps o'er the homeland dear;
Each little pink tube filled with sweets for the bees
Brings thousands of golden wings near;
Full well they have learned of the path they must come
To empty each tiny jar,
While clearer and sweeter the sound of their hum
Is borne from the meadow afar.

[_Chorus, humming. The sound can easily be kept continous, as all
will not take beath at the same time._)]
The fields of red clover bend low in the breeze
That sweeps o'er the homeland dear;
Each little pink tube filled with sweets for the bees
Brings thousands of golden wings near.
List! list! thousands of golden wings near.

2.
So bountiful nature prepares ever new
Her honey for all to find;
And sweets may be gathered if searchers be true
In hearts tho' they may seem unkind;
If we like the bees, shining hours improve,
And ne'er give an idle sting,
Some beauty we'll find will respond to our love
For ev'ry created thing.

([with Chorus, humming.])

===================================================
  FARMER.  And now boys, we must make ready for our labors.
What a glorious season this is when the earth yields her fruits
so generously to us.

No. 5.  WHEN EARTH WAKES FROM COLD WINT'RY SLUMBERS.
Song. Farmer.

1.
When earth wakes from cold wint'ry slumbers,
And birds pipe their call to the flowers,
The farmer must work tow'rd his planting
Thro' many laborious hours,
Thro' many laborious hours.
Yet naught can he know of the wonders,
Beginning where his work must cease.
The miracle old as the ages,
Which brings in the autumn's increase.

2.
What wonders beneath the earth's surface
When bursts from the seed the green blade!
None knows how the marvel's unfolding,
Save He who the universe made,
Save He who the universe made.
The rain falls from summer clouds grateful,
The sun shines with life giving power,
And silent 'neath the Hand divine
The fruit follows fast the flower.

===================
(_If thought best, at the Refrain, the motions of thrashing by
alternate blows may be mad as indicated in the music._)

No. 6. THE FLAIL SONG.
Semi-Chorus. Men.

1.
High piled 'neath the shelter of thrifty barns
The fruits of the year lie snug,
And goodly the sight to the eyes of those
Who have planted and reaped and dug.
Now past are the days when the reapers sang,
And followed the creaking wain,
Then come some where the sheaves rise in mounds of gold,
We'll thresh out the shining grain.

REFRAIN
So down (Down) down (down,)
on the sheaves (down,) the flail is pound- (down,) -ing,
Down, (down,) down, (down,) 
From the [d?]oor (down,) the stroke rebound- (down,) -ing,
Down, (down,) down, (down,)
While the the rhyth- (down,) -mic blows are sound- (down,) -ing,
down, down, 
Sounding thro' the trees
Then down (Down,) down, (down,)
Now the wheat (down,)
below is ly- (down,) -ing,
Down, (down,) down, (down,)
While our stea- (down,) -dy blows we're ply- (down,) -ing,
down, (down,) down, (down,)
Soon shall all (down,) the chaff be fly- (down,) -ing,
down, (down,) down, (down,)
On the summer breeze.

2.
What perfume now steals thro' the great barn doors,
What pictures they frame beyond;
Who'd sigh for the cities of brick and stone
When the leaves redden round the pond?
The Indian summer now spreads o'er all
Her beautiful hazy vail,
And gladly we know that the time's now come
For swinging the heavy flail.

(REFRAIN)

=====================
No. 7. HUSKING CHORUS.
All the voices.

  (_In the Refrain, the motion of husking the corn may be made.
At the words, "Pile the corn," the motion of throwing the corn
into a pile will be appropriate._)

1.
Then comes the time of the short'ning days,
When frost touches all the land,
When fires leap high on the broad hearth stone,
We rally, a social band;
The lads and lassies on work intent
Sit round in a busy throng,
To husk the corn, how the fingers fly
In the even-ings cold and long.

REFRAIN
Strip the husk from the treasure it encases,
Tear the silk from its loving close embraces,
Of these guardians we must leave no traces.
Pile the corn, (Pile the corn,) pile the corn.
Happy hearts to make the busy fingers clever,
Leaf and grain you must say farewell forever,
It is said that the best of friends must sever,
Pile the corn. (Pile the corn,) pile the corn.

2.
The torches flicker and glow again,
And shadows in corners lie,
The cheerful light's on each happy face,
And shines in each friendly eye;
The corn uprises in golden piles,
The husks make a leafy screen,
Tho' future days may be full of care,
We shall ne'er forget this scene.

(REFRAIN)

(_Exeunt._)

===========================
  DOUGLAS (_enters and looks about_).  Phyllis is not here.  Why
should I expect she would leave the others and come to meet me.
She does not know how I long to see her, and I have not the
courage to tell her.

No. 8.  AS YEARNS THE SEA.
Song.  Douglas.

1.
As yearns the sea upon the shore
To rise to great and greater height;
So longs the tide of love in me
To rise into her sight,
To rise into her sight.

No reason soothing gentle power
Can all the leaping flames repress,
It shoots with tongues that speak and burn
To gain her tenderness,
To gain her tenderness.

REFRAIN
I love, I love but her alone,
And seek her with adoring eyes;
Could I but gain her for my own,
This earth would be a paradise,
This earth would be a paradise.

2.
With life this passion intertwines,
And ev'ry heartbeat pants with thirst;
If she would only smile on me
My story forth would burst,
My story forth would burst.

My ev'ry breath I breathe for her,
And all my dreams her form doth fill,
Death only can my shackles break,
My earnest longings still,
My earnest longings still.

(REFRAIN)

  DOUGLAS (_speaks_).  I must return or I shall be missed; yet
after a while I shall come back here again.  Phyllis will be
sure to leave the house before long, and I may meet her for one
word alone.  (_Exit_).

=====================
  (_Enter Chapleigh, dressed as a dude with eyeglass, large
stick, and satchel, and looks about him._)
  CHAPLEIGH.  Well, I fancy this is the place.  Perfect west and
and mild wecweation was what the doctor---aw---ordered for me.
'Chapleigh, my dear fellah,' he said, 'I appwehend sewious
wesults for you unless you leave the city's excitements at once.
I see symptons---howible though---of softening of the bwain,'
and so of course here I am.

No. 9.  I'VE SOUGHT THE COUNTWY'S BEAUTIES.
Song.  Chapleigh.

  (_Let the solo singers remember to come well to the front and
sing distinctly to the audience._)

1.
I've sought the countwy's beauties,
And now let Nature's hand
Upon my heated forehead
Lay her cawesses bland;
Blow on, ye murm'ring bweezes,
And blow, ye, little flowers,
For Chapleigh's come among you
To spend some westful hours.

2.
The wude uncultured childwren
Of nature in this spot
May wonder and admire me,
And learn what that are not!
I fancy that my eyeglass
And gen'wal air of tone
Will never be forgotten
When I have come and gone.

=====================================
  (_Enter Phyllis from the house with a spinning wheel which she
sets down outside the door._)
  CHAPLEIGH.  My, what a pwetty girl!
  (_Phyllis walks all around him, staring, and he smiles
complacently._)
  CHAPLEIGH.  This is just the way I supposed it would be.
Victim number one.
  PHYLLIS.  What are you?
  CHAPLEIGH.  A gentlemen, my dear.  I dare say you never saw
one before.
  PHYLLIS (_shaking her head_).  No.  Aren't they funny!
  CHAPLEIGH (_lets his eyeglass fall and stares at her---at
last speaks:_) I am the boarder that Farmer Meadows is
expecting.  Who may you be,---his daughter?
  PHYLLIS.  Yes, I am Phyllis.
  CHAPLEIGH.  Her name is as pwetty as she is.  And what were you
about to do, Phyllis, with that peculiar looking object?
  PHYLLIS.  I was about to spin. I find I like to spin much better
than quilt; and there are so many of them, the do not need me.
  CHAPLEIGH.  No; I am sure you are much better off here.  Shall
you have an objection to my watching you while you spin?
  PHYLLIS.  It is nothing to me.  Very likely I shall forget all
about you.  Yes, you may watch me if you will go and sit over
there (_indicating a rustic seat across the stage_) and not talk
to me.  (_Chapleigh obeys._)

No. 10.  IN THE PEACEFUL SHADOW.
Spinning Song.  Phyllis.

  (_The motion of the spinning wheel is too well known to need
any direction here._)

1.
In the peaceful shadow of the spreading trees,
Here I sit and spin while sings the summer breeze,
Sighing wing and whirring wheel their murmurs lend;
In one soft har-mon-ious song their voices blend.

REFRAIN
Spinning pleasant fancies while the shadow dances
Of the waving maple branches o'er the verdant grass.
List'ning to their voices,
Ev'rything rejoices,
Wheel and breeze and song enchant the hours as they pass.

2.
Birds draw near and o'er me in the branches lurk,
Curiously they watch me while I'm at work;
Should a little song well over from my heart,
Quick from depths above me silv'ry trills will start.

(REFRAIN)

  DOUGLAS (_enters, and not seeing Chapleigh at first, speaks:_)
Oh, Phyllis, you are here!  I left the others hoping to get a
word with you.  What good fortune---
  PHYLLIS (_indicating Chapleigh_).  We are not alone.
  DOUGLAS (_starting and staring_).  What is it?
  PHYLLIS.  It is a gentleman.
  CHAPLEIGH.  And what is this---aw---object?  Ye gods, what
trousers!  Ah, I have it.  My good friend, you must be the
countwy bumpkin I have heard about.  Tell me, have you any
connection with the---aw---other countwy pwoduct, the pumpkin?
  DOUGLAS (_frowning_).  No---aw---I haven't.  How did they
happen to let you get away?
  CHAPLEIGH.  Oh, my dear fellah, they _sent_ me away, don't you
know.  They were afraid for me---aw---(_tapping his forehead_)
here!
  DOUGLAS.  Umph!  I should think they might have been.
  FARMER (_enters, followed by chorus_).  Who have we here?
  CHAPLEIGH (_raising his hat_).  Have I the pleasure of
addressing Farmer Meadows?
  FARMER.  The same.  Are you the young man I was expecting?
  CHAPLEIGH.  I am.  I was just going to tell what I expected
to find in your hospitable home.

=======================================
No. 11.  IN THE MORNING THE BIRD SONGS.
Song.  Chapleigh and Chorus.

  (_Chapleigh comes well to the front, the chorus in a humorous
mood draws near behind him and at his side, but not too far front._)

1.
In the morning the bird songs shall wake me from dweams,
And I'll wise to the clear crystal day.
O're the dew-spangled gwass I will look, but it seems
Fwom the dampness I must keep away,

[overlap voices]
[CHORUS]
Ho! ho! ho!
From its dampness he must, ha! ha! ha!
keep away, keep away!
[CHAPLEIGH]
From its dampness I must keep away.

[CHAPLEIGH, without overlap]
Then when Phoebe has dweid all the landscape so fair,
I may wander wherever I will,
Gather bewies or flower, or breathe the sweet air,
Or show you my sportmanlike skill,

[overlap voices]
[CHORUS]
Ha! ha! ha! just to show us his sportsmanlike skill,
ha! ha! ha! just his skill;
[CHAPLEIGH]
Or show you my sportsmanlike skill.

[CHORUS, without overlap]
Oh, ye sparrows and flinches this song ought to thrill you,
For Chapleigh has come her expressly to kill you!

2.
I shall wander about when they're ploughing the fields,
Or inhale the sweet scent of the hay.
I shall look at the cwops that your good meadow yields,
And I'll calculate what it will pay.

[overlap voices]
[CHORUS]
Oh, he'll calculate, calculate what it will pay,
ha! ha! what it will pay,
[CHAPLEIGH]
Yes, I'll tell you just what it will pay.

[CHAPLEIGH, without overlap]
Then with appetite keen I'll sit down at your board,
And eat bewies and chicken and cweam.
Give me anything good that your larder affords:
Now you see I have told you me scheme,

[overlap voices]
[CHORUS]
Ha! ha! ha! yes, we see he has told us,
has told us, his wonderful scheme:
[CHAPLEIGH]
You see I have told you my scheme.

[CHORUS, without overlap]
Oh, ye chickens beware, for this wonder will meet you,
Not only he'll kill you but he also will eat you!

  CHAPLEIGH.  Why! I weally believe they're chaffing me.  They
don't know me yet.  I'll make them open their eyes before long.
  FARMER.  My friends, I thank you for all your help you have
given me to-day.  It is not the least of life's joys that we
can assist one another.

==============================
No. 12.  FRIENDSHIP, HOLY TIE.
Quartet.  (Without accompaniment.)

1.
Friendship, holy tie,
Binding hearts for aye,
Tho' the years be ever flying,
Leaves be springing, leaves by dying,
Be thou ever nigh,
Be thou ever nigh.

2.
Loving, kindly word,
Reaching depths unstirred,
Tho' life's trials surge around us,
Dread misfortune scarce can wound us,
Long as thou art heard,
Long as thou art heard.

3.
Cordial helping hand,
Quick at thy command;
All our doubts and fears will scatter,
While we have our friends what matter,
Bound in friendship's band,
Bound in friendship's band.

======================================
No. 13.  BUT SEE THE SHADOWS LENGTHEN.
Good Night Chorus.

1.
But see the shadows lengthen,
The day draws to a close,
Farewell we must be saying,
And leave you to repose;
We hear the cowbells tinkle,
And eve-ning song of birds,
While low the sun is sinking,
'Tis time for parting words,
(Good night, good night,)
good night.

2.
Wrapped in night's soft dark curtain
May all in safely sleep,
While stars above are watching
O're vale and mountain steep;
Good night, and may all blessings
Enrich the coming year,
Good night, into God's keeping
Commend all we hold dear,
(Good night, good night,)
good night.

================================
  (_Stage rather dark._)
  CHAPLEIGH (_enter with guitar. Speaks_):  These people go to bed
with the chickens.  I have an idea that pwetty Phyllis is vewy much
impwessed with me, so I am going to follow up my advantage with a
sewenade.  I never saw the girl who was pwoof against the guitar.

No. 14.  O LADY, APPEAR AT THY CASEMENT, and HOW SWEETLY
                  THE SUMMER AIR FILLING.
Serenade and Ensemble.  Chapleigh, Douglas, Phyllis and Margaret.

[CHAPLEIGH]
O lady, appear at thy casement,
'Tis love sends a message to thee;
The owange groves pale in the moonlight
Now list to the moan of the sea.
The nightingale's passionate singing
Thwobs sweet thro' the shadowy night;
Let perfume and song now entweat thee
To show thy fair face to my sight.

  (_A noise outside is heard like a dog barking_).
  CHAPLEIGH.  Dear me, that sounds like a dog.  What a disagweable
place the countwy is, to be sure.  I wonder if it's a watch dog,
and he is let loose at night.  If it weren't for Phyllis, I'd---
  (_Enter Douglas without seeing Chapleigh, who has retreated.
Looks up at Phyllis' window.  Speaks):_  It is some comfort to
see her shadow on the window curtain!  Oh, if I could only keep
away from her!  She cares nothing for me.
  CHAPLEIGH (_coming forward_).  No, that's vewy twue, my boy.
Phyllis cares nothing for you.  How should she?  You haven't any
style, you know---no air of the man of the world, such as I have.
I natuwally dazzle her; but see here, I want to give her a sewenade.
Suppose you join me.  You won't injure the effect much.
  DOUGLAS.  I don't feel in the mood for singing.
  CHAPLEIGH.  Oh, yes.  You just touch along.  You see, I suspect
there is a dog awound here, and if he appears then you can attend
to him.
  DOUGLAS.  All right.  It makes no difference to me what I do.  I
will "touch along" and will protect you, if that is what you're
after.

[overlapped voices]
[CHAPLEIGH]
O lady, appear at thy casement,
'Tis love sends a message to thee.
[DOUGLAS]
O lady appear.
'Tis love sends a message

[MARGARET, not overlapped]
What heavenly strains are those, so sweetly swelling.

  CHAPLEIGH.  "Heavenly stwains" is good; but mischief take it,
that's the girl.
---
[PHYLLIS]
I heard music! strains of melody filled the air.

[DUET]
1.
How sweetly, how sweetly the summer air filling,
Those strains break the stillness, the stillness of night,
Their melody all my my soul, all my soul thrilling,
Like angel notes, angel notes tender and bright.

2.
While dewdrops, while dewdrops the heavens are weeping,
Sing on, sing on, and my senses unchain.
Mysterious voice, mysterious voice
Continue thy strain, continue thy strain,

[CHAPLEIGH]
Now once again, now once again.

[overlapped voices]
[PHYLLIS and MARGARET]
How sweetly, how sweetly the summer air filling,
Those strains break the stillness, the stillness of night,
Their melody all my my soul, all my soul thrilling,
Like angel notes, angel notes tender and bright.
[CHAPLEIGH]
O lady, appear at thy casement,
'Tis love sends a message to thee;
The owange groves pale in the moonlight
Now list to the moan of the sea.
The nightingale's passionate singing
Thwobs sweet thro' the shadowy night;
Let perfume and song now entweat thee
To show thy fair face to my sight.
[DOUGLAS]
O lady, appear,
'Tis love sends a message,
The orange groves pale,
Oh, list to the sea,
The nightingale's passionate singing
Throbs sweet tho' the shadowy night,
Throbs sweet tho' the shadowy night,
the shadowy night,
thy fair face to my sight.

========================================
  FARMER.  Welcome, friends and neighbors all.  Welcome in the name
of my Phyllis, whose birthday we celebrate.  How time moves on!

No. 15.  OLD TIME IS A MERCILESS FELLOW.
Song.  Farmer.

1.
Old Time is a merciless fellow,
He stops not for young or for old,
You may pray, you may beg, but his flying
You can not impede nor withhold,
You can not impede nor withhold.
His footsteps so swift, no beseeching---
No praring e'er yet made him stay.
No matter who lingers or dallies,
Old Time must be up and away!
up and away! must be up and away[!]

2.
Old Time since the world's first creation
Has worked his own will upon man;
He drives him from childhood to manhood,
His toy since the ages began.
"Move on," his command tho' unspoken
We must without question obey,
And haste with him all unresisting,
For Time must be up and away!
up and away! must be up and away!

3.
The babe lies not long in his cradle,
For childhood comes on, O so fast;
Of youth, one can scarce tast the sweetness,
Ere lighthearted youth, too, is past.
Then fill the days full that are left you,
Be gentle and wise, good and gay.
For Time e'er repeats the old story,
"Oh, I must be up and away!
up and away! must be up and away!["]

  FARMER.  Yes, time flies on; but yesterday, its seems to me, my
girl was a child.  To-day she is a woman.  Ah! here she comes to 
give you all a welcome.

======================================
No. 16.  BLESSINGS ON THE MAIDEN FAIR.
Chorus of Villagers.

1.
Blessings on the maiden fair Crown this happy day;
May her path be free from care,
Most fervently we pray;
Fresh as flowers in early Spring
Let her heart remain.
May the years no sorrow bring,
No remorse or pain.

2.
Peaceful as the river's flow
Be her life, her gentle life;
Let misfortune's winds ne'er blow,
With their endless strife,
With their endless, endless strife.
Angels guard her ev'ry hour,
All her steps attend.
From all ill our blooming flower,
May their care defend,
May their constant care defend.

(1.)

======================================
No. 17.  HOW SWELLS MY HEART WITH JOY.
Song.  Phyllis.

1.
How swells my heart with joy to hear
These words of deep good will;
Oh, may the years that are to come
Your prophecies fulfill.
My childhood's flown, now in the world
I, too, must take a place,
And strive to do a woman's part
With true and modest grace,
With true and modest grace.

2.
I'll be my father's housekeeper,
And show so wise a head
That he'll be glad his little girl
Has left me in her stead;
The world is very full of joy,
'Tis plainly to be seen,
One can not realize it at all---
Till one is seventeen.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Till one is seventeen.

3.
I'm grateful for the boon of life,
My heart lifts up its praise
For all the melody and mirth
That fill my happy days.
And while I hear the birds' glad hymns
And blooming flowers see,
My thanks shall rise to Him above,
Who gives these gifts to me.
My thanks shall rise to Him above,
Who gives these gifts to me.

  MARGARET.  I do not know whether I feel more like a sister or
a mother to Phyllis, but well I remember her a little baby when
her father first took me into his house. I was nearly as old as
Phyllis is now, and she seemed to take to me at once.

====================================
No. 18.  A LITTLE SILKY GOLDEN HEAD.
Song.  Margaret.

1.
A little silken golden head
Lay soft against my breast,
Two violets eyes closed dreamily,
And baby sank to rest.
Two little hands with rosy palms,
Like half unclosed sweet flowers
Drooped listlessly in quiet
Though the restful slumb'ring hours.
Bye-low, bye-low,
Hush, that love may speak,
For heav'n is very near the heart
Where rests a baby's cheek.

2.
The wind goes whisp'ring thro' the trees
Its summer lullaby.
The birds sing low amid the boughs,
To leafy shades they fly.
The flowers nod, too, beneath the sun,
And one another tell,
A baby flower has gone to rest,
Sleep well, sweet bud, sleep well.
Bye-low, bye-low,
Hush, that love may speak,
For heav'n is very near the heart
Where rests a baby's cheek.

  CHAPLEIGH.  Pwetty slow pace this, by Jove.  If they're not all
mourning now because that pwetty girl isn't a baby.  Bless me, I
should pewish if she was.  She is the only---aw---circumstance
which makes this---aw---place beawable.

======================================
  (_The chorus can be appearing to talk to each other in little
groups while this song is being sung_).

No. 19.  PWETTY PHYLLIS IS THE MAIDEN.
Song.  Chapleigh.

1.
Pwetty Phyllis is the maiden,
Maiden fair for me;
She's a picture I can tell you,
Worth one's while with me;
Take your stupid little babies,
Or your tomboy girls,
Give me Phyllis, pwetty Phyllis,
She's the pearl of pearl.

2.
She will take a good position
If I want to sketch;
Or if I from thirst am fainting.
Ice cold milk will fetch;
But the gift before whose gweatness
All my manhood bows,
Is just this,---the lovely Phyllis
Has no fear of cows.

3.
So we often stwoll together
On the dewey morns.
With the charming Phyllis near me,
I've no fear of horns;
And tho' many things disliking
In my pastorale,
Phyllis has a charm whose sweetness
Nevermore can pall.

=======================================
  (_Douglas approaches Phyllis with a bunch of flowers in his
hand and sings this song.  All move forward toward the front,
the chorus now giving attention._)

No. 20.  JEWELS	I HAVE NONE TO GIVE THEE.
Song.  Douglas.

Jewels I have none to give thee,
Nor could gems make thee more fair,
Yet had I the wealth of ladies,
All would be for thee to share.
Blossoms bright from field and garden,
Scattered by a bounteous hand,
I have gathered for thy birthday,
Thou most fair, thou most fair,
Thou most fair in all the land.

  (_Phyllis accepts the flowers with a bow of acknowledgement._)

[CHORUS]
Fairest maid, fairest maid,
Fairest maid in all the land.

===========================
  (_Chapleigh brings a large box of candy and approaches Phyllis
on the other side._)

No. 21.  JEWELS I HAVE NONE TO GIVE THEE.
Song.  Chapleigh and Chorus.

Jewels I have none to give thee,
Did not think you Pa'd consent,
But there's something here, I fancy,
That should make a maid content.
Choc'late creams and sugared almonds,
Candied fruit and peppermint.
Sweets I offer to the sweetest
That should move, that should move,
That should move a heart of flint.

  (_Phyllis takes the box which is so large and heavy that she
drops the flowers and lets them lie unheeded_).

[CHORUS]
Oh, yes, that box will come in handy,
For all the girls like cremes and candy,
But when 'tis love she will not hear him,
And Doulglas has no cause to fear him.

  (_Margaret hurries forward and picks up the flowers at which
Douglas has been looking gloomingly.  She puts them on the box
that Phyllis is holding, and shakes her head at her_).

==============================================
  FARMER.  And now, friends, I would you break you fast and
partake of our humble cheer.  I know you wish well to my child.
We will drink her health in that wine of life which God himself
has made---cold water.

No. 22.  DEAR MAID, WE WISH YOU YEARS OF LIFE.
Chorus.

Dear maid, we wish you years of life,
All happy as today;
Oh, may prosperity and joy
Remain with you alway.
And when o'er some man's heart and home
You reign, his lifelong queen,
May you be happy as the day
When you were seventeen.

  CHAPLEIGH.  The sentiment---aw---is well enough, but the water.
What a---aw---liquid to dwink a toast in.  I wonder if that is all
he is going to give us.
  FARMER.  Come to the house, friends.  A repast awaits you there.
  (_Exeunt all but Douglas.  Phyllis and Chapleigh go last talking
busily together, and as she goes Phyllis drops the flowers again,
without noticing them.  When they have gone Douglas picks them up
and comes foreward_).
  DOUGLAS.  It looks as though Phyllis liked that fellow from the
city.  She is too kind-hearted to throw my poor flowers away; but
she simply does not care for them.

======================================
No. 23.  THE LILY RISING ON ITS STALK.
Song.  Douglas.

1.
The lily rising on its stalk
Is not more pure than she,
The fragrance breathing from its leaves
Comes not more sweet to me;
The whiteness of its petals is
Not fairer than her cheek;
Ah! me, the lily's beauty bids me
Never dare to speak,
Never dare to speak.

2.
The rose that blushes 'neath the sun
Is paler than her lips,
Her grace is finer than the flower
When in the breeze it dips;
But ah! the rose has caught the sun
Within its heart of gold,
While my sweet love, her heart to me
Is ever hard and cold,
Ever hard and cold.

  MARGARET (_enters_).  I missed you Douglas.  Why do you not
come and join the company?
  DOUGLAS.  I haven't the heart for it.
  MARGARET (_noticing the flowers_).  You must not mind what
that heedless child does to-day.  Her poor little head is almost
turned by all the attention she has received.  She will feel badly
enough when she misses her flowers.  Come, forgive her, Douglas.
  DOUGLAS.  I have nothing to forgive.  I do not blame her for not
caring for me.  (_While saying this last sentence both go slowly
out_).
  PHYLLIS (_enters looking about as though searching for
something_).  My poor flowers.  I surely must have dropped them
here.

===========================================
No. 24.  EACH FIELD IS A BLOSSOMING GARDEN.
Song.  Phyllis.

1.
Each field is a blossoming garden,
Refreshed by its babbling steams;
Each wood filled with ferns the rarest,
That hide from the sun's hot beams;
The world is aglow with color,
Sweet blossoms to all are free,
Yet where are the flowers he gathered,
And gave with his kind words to me?
And gave with kind words to me?

2.
Bloom on, ye red roses, in sweetness,
Your fragrance, blue vio-let, yield;
Not one of your charms I covet
In garden or wood, or field;
For roses well ne'er be glowing
As those blushed for me today,
And no more will breathe such fragrance
As I have let slip away,
As I have let slip away.

3.
Ah! me, poor ignorant maiden,
Knows not what is in her heart,
What one values least at daybreak,
By noon is of life apart;
Oh, let me each day grow wiser,
Nor tinsel mistake for gold,
Lest I should wake up from dreaming
To find all the world grown cold,
To find all the world grown cold.

  PHYLLIS.  They are not here.  I must seach elsewhere.  Oh, I
must find them.!  (_Exit_).

====================================
  CHAPLEIGH (_enters with fishing basket over his shoulder and
rod in hand_).  I am tired of the chatter of these countwy bumpkins.
I can't get a word with Phyllis, so I am going off by myself to
fish.  I always have gweat luck when I go fishing.

No. 25.  I DEARLY LOVE THE PICTUWESQUE.
Song.  Chapleigh.

1.
I dearly love the pictuwesque
Beside a shady stream;
I like to throw my line, and then
Lean back and sweetly dream.
The float wests on the little waves,
The birds fly overhead.
The bweezes in the chowus join,
As though the woodland said:

[REFRAIN]
Oh, come, come, come,
ye pwetty speckled twout,
It is no countwy bumpkin
Who wants to pull you out.


2.
I watch the clouds send thwough the sky
Like down upon the blue,
And get new ideas for cwavats
Of that celestial hue;
The colors that awound melie
I look at thro' my glass,
And think of topcoats superfine,
While yet these accents pass:

([REFRAIN]) 

3.
Yes, of the sport of fishing I
Am vewy twuly fond.
It makes no differwence to me
In wiver, bwook or pond;
Because I have such luck, you know,
No fins can me withstand,
And when I next come back I'll show
What I have bwought to land:

([REFRAIN]) 

  (_At the close of the song the prelude to No. 22 commences, and
the chorus enter, singing the toast "Dear Maid, we wish you," etc._)
  FARMER.  And now friends, the ceremony that I have always
performed on this day.  Do you see that little avenue of sixteen
fruit trees set out on my child's birh-days?  They are outside my
land and are meant to cheer the wayfarer.  To-day a seventeenth
must begin to strike its tender roots into the earth.

=====================================
No. 28.  MAN LIVETH NOT UNTO HIMSELF.
Chorus.

[1.]
Man liveth not unto himself,
The Book of books makes known,
And He whose life was all one gift
The way of life has shown;
If in ourselves our tho't doth stop,
The price we sure must pay,
More useless grow to all mankind
With each succeeding day,
With each succeeding day.

2.
Let tho't of others still find room
Within the busy mind,
The Father sends us many gifts
To pass on to mankind,
To pass on to mankind;
The wondrous miracle of growth
Is one we daily see,
And so in pure goodwill to man
We'll plant this little tree.

3.
Though Phyllis may not taste its fruit,
Nor sit beneath its shade,
'Twill signify that once there lived
A kindly little maid,
Who, just to make the world more fair
To others yet to live,
Was glad, that tho' so poor and weak,
She had her mite to give,
She had her mite to give.

  FARMER.  Come, Douglas, you have always held the tree in place.
Come, lad.
(_They go out, and the chorus press to the side of the stage as
though witnessing the planting of the tree_).
  ONE OF THE CHORUS.  A storm is coming, but they will easily
finish planting the tree before it reaches here.
  ANOTHER.  The rain will be good for the new tree if the wind
does not blow it down.
  ANOTHER.  Never fear!  What the farmer does is well done.  The
tree will stand.
  ANOTHER.  We are going to have a hard one:---hear the thunder!
  ANOTHER.  Well, let it come; but it is not very near; there
will be plenty of time.
  ANOTHER.  Ah! the work is done; here they come.
  (_The Chorus move back to their places, while the Quartett come
forward.  Thunder is heard occassionally during the Quartett, but
not loud enough to interrupt or disturb the singing._).

========================
No. 27.  BLESS THE TREE.
Quartett.

[PHYLLIS, MARGARET, DOUGLAS, FARMER]
1.
O Father in heaven who all things created,
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) bless the tree,
bless the tree.
Send rain to refresh it, and sunshine to warm it,
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) bless the tree,
bless the tree.
Let life thrill its rootlets and hasten its growing,
Set sap strong and rich through its little twigs flowing,
Existence itself to Thee 'tis owing,
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) Father bless (bless) the tree.

2.
In long years to come may it spread leafy branches,
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) bless the tree,
bless the tree.
Cool shade give the stranger, from summer heat burning,
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) bless the tree,
bless the tree.
Let the bird songs ring gladly from out its recesses,
Let breezes pass over it leaves with caresses,
Let fruit ripe and sweet be the crown it possesses.
Bless the tree, (Bless the tree,) Father bless (bless) the tree.

==============================
No. 28.  'TIS COMING NOW.
Storm Chorus.  All the voices.

'Tis coming now, the thunder rolls
And o'er the sky the vivid lightnings flamem
'Tis coming now, no pow'r on earth
The elements can turn or turn ot tame;
(The mighty elements can turn or tame;)
At heaven's mercy here we stand,
And watch the black clouds swiftly rise,
While fiercest conflicts rage above,
While fiercest conflicts rage above,
Before our awed and wond'ring eyes,
Our awd and wond'ring eyes.

Yet One on high controls the storm,
And we may rest secure without a fear,
Yes, we may rest withoug a fear
While thunders ech- (roll and ech-) -o far and near.
Though lighntning's flashing blinding
chain, (flashing blinding chain,)
Tho' light'ningd flashing blinding
chain (flashing blinding chain)
Bends heav'n (heav'n itself with)
itself (awful crash apart, Rends) a- (heav'n a-) part (-part)
With awful crash apart.
The thunder bolts spring from His hand,
The thunder bolts spring from His hand,
So list with quiet heart,
So list with quiet heart.

While dark and darker grows the air,
And hill and dale resound,
Think only of the cooling shower,
Think only of the cooling shower
To cheer the thristy ground,
To cheer th dry and thirsty ground.

Thro' flame and tempest's rushing wind,
Thro' flame and tempest's rushing wind,
'Mid thunder roll and lightning flash,
'Mid thunder roll and lightning flash
One thankful tho't have we,
One thankful tho't have we,
Whatever rain it needs, will come
To bless our little tree,
To bless our little tree.

================================
No. 29.  OH, THE BEAUTIFUL RAIN.
Song.  Phyllis.

Oh, the beautiful rain,
'Tis falling with measureless blessing;
The meadow, wood and grassy plain
The new refreshing gladly gain,
While onward gaily pressing
The laughing brooklet flows
Oh!, the beautifil rain,
Of goodness and mercy 'tis telling,
Meadow and mountain and forest and fountain
The song of thanksgiving are swelling.
Bless his name,
Bless his name,
Whose love is forever o'er us;
Old and young,
Join the song,
With nature prolong the chorus,
With nature prolong the chorus.
Ah ...
ah ...
ah ...
ah ...
ah ...
The chorus prolong,
The chorus prolong,
With nature's chorus prolong.

  (_A cry without, and Douglas rushes out quickly, returning with
Chapleigh, who clings to him_).
  CHAPLEIGH.  My pweserver!  How can I ever thank you.  As I was
hurwying home from fishing, where I didn't get a single fish, and
twying to get here before the storm broke, a twee was stwuck right
near me.  I cwied out for I thought it was the last of Chapleigh.
And I give you my word my nerves were so shocked I couldn't take
a step without assistence.  I should have wemained there and
pewished if it hadn't been for you! My pweserber!
  PHYLLIS (_approaching Douglas and speaking timidly_).  I am so
glad you were here to save him.
  DOUGLAS.  He was not in much danger; but if it would have been
a favor to you, Phyllis, I wish I might have saved his life in
reality.  Perhaps you would value the gift of Mr. Chapleigh's
precious neck on your birth-day more highly than you did my
poor flowers.
  (_Chapleigh wanders off and appears to talk to members of the
chorus_).
  PHYLLIS.  Oh, I lost those flowers, and I felt so badly about
it.
  DOUGLAS.  Did you?  I don't know why you should.
  PHYLLIS.  Why, because---because you gave them to me, Douglas.
  DOUGLAS.  Phyllis, don't say such things unless you mean a great
deal---more than I dare hope you will ever mean.
  (_Chapleigh regards the lover_).
  PHYLLIS.  I think---I mean---all you want me to, Douglas.
  (_Douglas takes her hand_).
  CHAPLEIGH.  Look at that!  I do believe Phyllis is so gwateful
to that man for pwerserving me that she is letting him make love
to her.  Oh, look here, I call that letting her gwatitude cawy
her too far.  I shan't stay here!  This settles it!  Farmer Meadows
(_advancing to the farmer_), I wegwet to say I must bid you adieu.
I came out here to west my bwain.  Your thunder has startled me
inexcusably.  I also came for wecreation.  You fish wefuse to bite.
I therefore decide to leave.  Farewell (_shakes hands with farmer_).
Phyllis, farewell.  Do not let my departure sadden you more than you
can help. (_Exit_).
  FARMER (_regarding Douglas and Phyllis_).  What are you talking
about, young folks?
  DOUGLAS.  Farmer Meadows, you've known me ever since I was born.
I love Phyllis.  May I have her?
  FARMER (_taking a hand of each and joining them_).  No one else
shall, with my consent, and that I made up my mind to, long ago.
Bless you both.  Friends, this birth-day has become an occasion of
greater importance than I thought.  Come, all, rejoice with me.
Douglas and Phyllis have plighted their faith.  Wish them happiness.
See, even the storm is passing by.

===================================
No. 30.  WEDDING BELLS.
Full Chorus.

Wedding bells! wedding bells!
Ever welcome is your song!
Peace, good will and pure delight
Now gladden all our friendly throng, our friendly throng.
Music bright, clear and bright,
While the chiming numbers ring
Long life and prosperity
To the happy pair we sing,
Long life and prosperity
To the happy pair we sing.

Wedding bells! wedding bells!
Once again their merry chime!
Blessings fall from heav'n above us
At this joyous happy time,
At this joyous happy time,
This joyous happy time.
Honest hearts, loyal hearts
Beating evermore as one,
May your truth forever last
In the life that's now begun,
May your truth forever last
In the life that's now begun.

Wedding bells! wedding bells!
Tell that while the earth shall stand
Love is best of all the gifts
Sent from our Father's hand.
Honest hearts, loyal hearts,
Beating evermore as one,
May your truth forever last
In the life that's now begun,
May love and truth forever last
In the life that's now begun.

In the life (In the life that's now) begun,
In the life (In the life that's now) begun,
May your love and truth forever last
In the life's that's now begun.
