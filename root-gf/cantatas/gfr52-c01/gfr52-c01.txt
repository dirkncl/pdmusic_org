                                       ----------
  The Flowers meet in a secluded dell in the forest, to choose their Queen.  A person
discountented with the world, seeks, in the same place, retirement from its cares and
disapointments.  The Flowers tell of love and duty; and the Recluse---learning that, to
fill well the station allotted by Providence, is to be happy---resolves to return again
to usefullness and contentment among his fellow creatures.

                                      ----------
Recluse.---Baritone, or Mezzo Soprano.     | Hollyhock.---Mezzo Soprano.
 [This part may be taken by the Teacher.]  | Japonica.---Contralto.
Rose.---Soprano                            | Violet.---Contralto.
Sunflower.---Soprano                       | Mignionette.---Contralto.

  A portion of the stage, or platform, should be concealed from the audience
by trees or branches of evergreen,---the plot requiring that the singers
should be at times invisible.
  Interest will be added to the scene by such floral decorations of the entire
hall as circumstances may admit.
  It is desirable that the piano should be situated as to be seen only by
the singers, leaving the open part of the stage entirely unobstructed.  The
may be decked with the flowers (natural or artificial) that they may per-
sonify.  Care should be taken to avoid stiffness in the arrangement of the
performers, particularily in their entrance and exit.  Appropriate expres-
sion and manner, especially on the part of the solo singers, should be care-
fully observed.  A chair, suitably decorated, and raised a little from the
floor, for a throne, and a crown of roses for the Queen, will complete the
arrangements.
  During the performance of the Introduction, the singers should take their
places on the stage, timing is so as to be nearly all present when the first
Chorus (No. 2) commences; and they should leave before the entrance of
the Recluse.
  It would be well to sing No. 4 without accompaniment, if the parts are
equally balanced, and the voices are kept strictly in tune.  Although the
third part is written with the Base Clef, it is presumed that ladies will find
no difficulty in singing in on that account.  The Recitatives in this Semi-
chorus should commence before the previous chord is finished; and the
Semi-chorus again should begin before the close of the last note of the Re-
citatives.  Let the entrance, at No. 8, be in a sprightly manner, in accord-
ance with the subject and music.  It would be well if the Helliotrope and
Mignionette were taken be smaller pupils.
  During the performance of No. 18, the singers should retire.  If conve-
nient, the room may be a little darkened.  The first part of No. 19 will be
better without accompaniment, if the voices can be kept in tune.  In the
Duet, No. 20, one or both of the performers should be invisible to the au-
dience.  This peace may be omitted, if not convenient to perform it.
  In No. 21, a pleasant effect will be produced by calling to each other from
different parts of the stage, and not appearing at the commencement of the
chorus.  The room should here be light.
  In No. 23 may be made one of the most effective pieces of the cantata, if
the singer enters rightly into its spirit.  It will be seen that the Hollyhock
commences while the chorus are singing.  No. 25 should be without accom-
paniment.
  The singers should retire during the performance of No. 27 and No. 28.
The chorus of Heather-bells, should be the younger pupils, if the voices
can be relied upon.
  At the commencement of the Coronation march, No. 29, the singers should
march in, and may perform, such evolutions during its performance, as the
taste of the teacher or leader may suggest.  At the close of No. 31, the
crown is placed upon the head of the Queen elect, and she rises to her
throne.
  In No. 32, the three voices taking the echo, should be in an adjoining
room.  The Queen rises in her throne and sings No. 33.  After No. 35, the
Recluse and other voices, stand near the throne, for the performance of the
last chorus.
  Should and of the pieces be found too short, they may generally be re-
peated.

well as a Table of Contents.]

No. 1.---INTRODUCTION.

==========================
No. 2.---CHORUS OF FLOWERS

1.
We are the flowers, the fair young flowers,
That come at the voice of spring,
To deck with our beauty the sylvan bowers,
And perfumes the zephyr's wing.

The blushing rose and the violet meek,
With the hue of morn on its timid cheek,
The daisy that blooms in the guiet dell,
The jessamine sweet, and the heather-bell.

We are the flowers, the fair young flowers,
That come at the voice of spring,
To deck with our beauty the sylvan bowers,
And perfumes the zephyr's wing.

List! List! There is a footstep near!
Away! Away! we must not linger here!
Hie we, then to the forest shade,
And hide us all in our quiet glade;
Away! Away!

2.
We are the flowers, the fair young flowers,
That come at the voice of spring,
To deck with our beauty the sylvan bowers,
And perfumes the zephyr's wing.

The marygold, dahlia, and sunflower too,
And the proud hollyhock with its gaudy hue,
The lily whose home is the pensive spot,
Where it sighs to the gentle forgetmenot.

We are the flowers, the fair young flowers,
That come at the voice of spring,
To deck with our beauty the sylvan bowers,
And perfumes the zephyr's wing.

List! List! There is a footstep near!
Away! Away! we must not linger here!
Hie we, then to the forest shade,
And hide us all in our quiet glade;
Away! Away!

=========================
No. 3.---SONG. (Recluse.)

Here would I rest, within this mossey cell,
Far from the busy scenes of strife and care.
It is a spot where I would love to dwell,
And breathe alone the pure untainted air.
The voice of Fame
Allure me forth no more,
To win the garlands that so soon must fade;
Ambition's wild aspiring dream is o'er,
My wished foiled, my eve-ry hope betrayed;
Wearied I seek repose beneath this peaceful shade:
Here would I rest, within this mossy cell.
Far from the busy scenes of strife and care.
It is a spot where I would love to dwell,
And breathe alone the pure untainted air.

============================================
No. 4.  SEMI-CHORUS OF FLOWERS. (concealed.)

1.[?]
Rest thee here, O calmy rest---
We shall soothe thy throbbing brest;
And our sweet and airy numbers
Stealing o'er thy tranquil slumbers,
Like the streamlet's gentle flow,
Shall bequile thy eve-ry wo.

[_Recit._ Recluse.]
Hark! hark! what sounds are those so passing sweet?

[Semi-Chorus]
Rest thee here---why shouldst thou roam
From our bright and blissful home?
While amid young blossom straying,
Balmy gales around thee playing,
Hope thy childhood's hours shall bring,
On her light and sportive wing.

[_Recit._ Recluse.]
Again theire strange, mysterious tones I hear,
Like angel voices stealing on the breeze.

[Semi-Chorus]
We will teach thee lessons sweet,
In our cool and soft retreat;
Here in one harmonious measure,
Floats the artless song of pleasure,
And contentment loves to dwell
In our green and mossy dell;
And contentment loves to dwell
In our green and mossy dell.

===============================
No. 5.---RECITATIVE. (Recluse.)

Lost, lost in wonder, and with rapture filled,
I gaze enchanted, yet no form I see!
Tell mem ye dark aisles of the forest,---
Say who dwells within your dark and secret shades.

===============================
No. 6.---DUET. (Rose and Lily.)

1.
Wouldst thou know what sounds are stealing
Thro' these fair and rural bowers?
'Tis no angel voice that greets theem
But the music of the flowers:
Angel eyes perchance are bending
O'er our silken leaves the while
Truth and innocence are blending,
In our fond and tender smile.

2.
We are Nature's artless minstrels,
She hath taught the lays we sing:
To the worn and weary spirit,
Thoughts of happiness we bring;
In thine ear we softly whisper,
When the earth is lulled to peace.
List thee then, for we are telling
Of a song that ne'er shall cease,

[overlapped voices]
List (thee then,) thee
then, (List thee then,)
for we are telling
Of (Of a song) a
song (Of a song)
that ne'er shall cease.

=========================
No. 7.---SONG. (Recluse.)

O gentle Peace, with thy returning ray,
How flies the dark and drear night away!
I drink as in the cloudless noon of youth,
The sacred fount of happiness and truth;
Sing on sweet flowers, and bear my heart away,
A willing captive to your magic lay;
Here while I rest,
While o'er me gently twine,
The creeping ivy and the clust'ring vine.

===========================
No. 8.---CHORUS OF FLOWERS.

1.
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen of the flowers?
The summer is coming in beauty arrayes,
And bright bees are humming thro' forest and glade;
O'er hilltop and mountain is merrily heard
The voice of the fountain and song of the bird,
The voice of the fountain and song of the bird.

2.
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen of the flowers?
The fairies are dancing o'er meadow and grove,
And pale stars are glancing like soft eyes of love;
Then who shall be queen of our beautiful throng,
To join in our mirth and awake us to song,
To join in our mirth and awake us to song.

3.
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen,
Who shall be queen of the flowers?
We'll choose from the fairest that ever were seen,
And gems of the rarest shall circle our queen;
The morning shall linger the fragrance to sip,
Which the dew-drop hath left on her delicate lip,
Which the dew-drop hath left on her delicate lip.

==================================
No. 9.---SOLO (Crocus) AND CHORUS.

I am the first of all the flowers
To hail the ope-ning spring; (Yes: the first)
I've (in) tales (spring.) of hope for the lonely heart,
In the sweet perfume I bring. (In the sweet perfume,)
I was the first to rear my head,
In this fair and goodly land, (this land,)
The first of all the flowers to greet
The eyes of the Pilgrim land; (of the Pilgrim band.)
And since the first in eve-ry clime deserves the right to reign.
(The right to reign.)
The honor of being the queen of flowers may I not justly claim.

[CHORUS]
The honor of being trhe queen of flowers
May she not justly claim.

===================================
No. 10.---SOLO (Dahlia) AND CHORUS.

[DAHLIA]
Peace false pretender, dost presume
With colors rich as mine to vie.
Look upon my beauteous bloom, and hang thy head and close thine eye.

[CHORUS]
More kindly words were better far.

[DAHLIA]
My stately form I proudly rear,
When summer skies are beaming bright,
When thou hast closed thy short career,
And day with thee is veiled in night.

[CHORUS]
Mere beauty is not proof of worth.

[DAHLIA]
And thou wouldst claim our queen to be,
Vain flower I treat thy claim with scorn,
How could thy subjects honor thee
Since thou would'st die ere they were born.

[DAHLIA and CHORUS]
Since thou would'st die ere they were born.

=======================================================
No. 11.---DUET (Heliotrope and Mignionette) AND CHORUS.

Tis not in beauty alone we may find
Purity goodness and wisdom combined;
Forms that are lightest are first to decay,
Hues that are brightest fade soonest away;
Gentle in manner, in temper serene,
These are the beauties we ask for our queen;

[CHORUS]
Yes: Innocence dwells with the humble and meek;
There lies the treasure---the pearl that we seek.

=====================================
No. 12.---SOLO (Japonica) AND CHORUS.

Prized by the beautiful and great,
Mine is a peerless name. (is a peeless name.)
Who rivals me in loveliness?
Who will dispute my claim? (her claim:)

[JAPONICA and CHORUS]
I (She) deck( decks) the fairest brows of earth,
And in the mazy dance, (the dance,)
The ruby lip my (her) smile returns,
And bright eyes on me (her) glance, (her glane,)

[CHORUS]
The ruby lip her smile returns,

[JAPONICA and CHORUS]
And bright eyes on me (her) glance.

=======================================
No. 13.---SOLO (Sun-flower) AND CHORUS.

[CHORUS]
But who comes here?
Who comes here?
'Tis the sunflower,
'Tis the sunflower!
Hail! hail! hail!

[SUNFLOWER]
Make way, ye silly praters all, for me,
And know that I alone your queen should be,

[CHORUS]
Hail! hail! Hail!
Bombastes ever hail!

[SUNFLOWER with (CHORUS)]
The golden sun looks on me all day,
And gives to me at night his last, his parting ray,
For me descends the cool and gently shower;
Mine is the noblest form, the broadest flower,
The (The) no- (noblest, no-) -blest (-blest)
form (form, ho, ho, ho!)
The (The) broad- (broadest, broad-) -est (-est)

What neef of umpire,
Mine the right to reign,
A right holds your boasted titles vain.
Down at my feet, and do obeisance,
And place the coronet upon my brow.

[overlapped voices]
[SUNFLOWER]
Down at my feet and do obeisance now,
And place the coronet upon my brow.
Down at my feet and do obeisance now,
And place the coronet upon my brow.
[CHORUS]
Down at her feet, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hail!
hail, hail, hail,
O gentle queen!
Down at her feet, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hail!
hail, hail, hail,

No. 13.---CHORUS.

[overlapped voices]
[First]
Say where is our favorite lily,
The child of the peaceful vale,
The lily that bows so sweetly
Its head to the laughing gale?
Doth the darkeyed violet linger
Where cooling streams repose
And where is the fairest and dearest,
Our beautiful blushing rose.
[Second]
Say where is the lily,

=================================
No. 15.---DUET (Violet and Lily).

Sister flowrets we are here,
At your call we now appear,
Not to tell of beauties rare,
Nor a sparkling crown to wear;
Rather would we choose to dwell
In our own secluded dell,
And our balmy odors fling
Where the birds so sweetly sing,
While the lowly cot we cheer:
Thus we in our humble sphere
Would be useful while we may,
Till we fade and pass away,
Till we fade and pass away.

=================================
No. 16.---SOLO (Rose) AND CHORUS.

[ROSE]
The balmy oders which we bear,
And softly breathe o'er all the earth,
The tints our silken leaves may wear,
We owe to Him who gave us birth.

[CHORUS]
We owe to Him who gave us birth.

[ROSE]
Then sacred through life's fleeting day,
We'll keep the charms so kindly given;
Our fragrance when our forms decay,
Shall waft like incense back to Heaven
shall waft (like incense back to Heav'n,)
Shall waft (like in-) )to (-cense)
Heaven. (back to Heav'n;

[overlapped voices]
[Two of the other solo voices.]
Our fragrance, when our forms decay,
[CHORUS]
Our fragrance, when our forms decay,
Our fragrance, when our forms decay,

[ROSE]
Shall waft ... to Heaven.
[Two of the other solo voices.]
Shall waft ... like in...cense back ... to Heaven.
[CHORUS]
Shall waft like incense back to Heaven,
Shall waft like incense back to Heaven

==============================
No. 17. RECIT.---(Tulip.)

Lo! twilight shadows gather o'er the hills,
Chant we now our versper lay,
As we seek our quiet haunts,
And with the morning light
Our Queen we'll choose.

No. 18.---CHORUS.

Come, come quickly away!
Soft winds chide our delay;
Night's call let us obey---
Come away;
Night, night, welcome to thee!
Our sleep gentle shall be;
Come, come, happy and free,
Come away!
Hark! hark! softly and clear,
Come away!
Sweet sounds steal on the ear:
Come away!
Come quickly away, quickly away, quickly away!
Come come quickly away!
Soft winds chide our delay;
Night's call let us obey;
Come away.

No. 19.---HYMN TO NIGHT---SEMI-CHORUS (concealed) AND SONG (Recluse.)

[CHORUS]
Fold, O night, thy veil around us,
While our silken leaves we close:
May the heavenly Power that clothes us,
Kindly guard our sweet repose!

[overlapped voices]

Hear our song,
O silent night,
Hear our song,
O silent night!
Yes; here, indeed I
Hear our song.

Hear their song, their song,
O hear their eve-ning song,
Hear their song, their song,
O hear their eve-ning song!
Yes; here, indeed,
I learn your lessons pure and sweet,
And my heart would ever turn,
In this calm and dear retreat,
To that heavenly hope divine,
Which God hath kindly given,
And eve-ry wish resign to the Holy will of Heaven,
O hear our song,
O hear our song.

No. 22.---CHORUS.

To the choice, to the choice,
While the morn is blushing o'er us;
Haste to make our
[Hollyhock interupts.]

============================================
No. 23.---RECITATIVE AND SONG---(Hollyhock.)

[CHORUS]
happy
[HOLLYHOCK]
Softly softly, dear friends! you've quite forgotten me
Another proof that sweet simplicity
And real worth to often are thrown:
A truth, I must confess, I blush to own.

Of course, 'tis needless of myself to tell,
Since my superior charms you know well,
And really if I now must speak my mind,
A better queen I'm sure could not find.
Do as you please: I only would suggest,
In modest terms, the one I deem the best;
Do as you please;
But then it seems to me,
You might as well bestow the crown on me.

======================
No. 24.---SEMI-CHORUS.

We love you all with true sincerity,
And would to either willing subjects be,
Though all alike our warmest feelings share,
Yet one alone the coronet must wear.

[CHORUS]
Who shall be queen? who shall be queen?
Who shall be queen of the flowers?
Let yonder stranger now decide,
And by his judgement will abide.

===========================================
No. 25.---SEMI-CHORUS. (All the Aspirants.)

Stranger that has heard our claim,
Wilt thou then our Sovereign name,
Humbly we appeal to thee,
Tell us who our queen shall be?

=========================
No. 26.---SONG. (Recluse)

1.
'Tis hard to choose where Nature's hand
Alike her gifts bestows,
Here eve-ry flower, on which I gaze,
With richest beauty glows,
Though all our admiration claim;
Yet in the rose we find,
A simple grace, a sweet perfume,
With loveliness combined.

2.
'Tis true that with this gentle flower,
A thorn is oft concealed;
But she who wears a coronet,
A sword must sometimes weild,
And since it is my duty now,
A sovereign to propose,
Wisdom must guide me in my choice---
Say, shall it be the rose?

[CHORUS]
The rose, the rose, the rose,
Our queen shall be.

=================
No. 27.---CHORUS.

Prepare we for the festive scene,
We'll crown with joy our lovely queen;
From rural cot and valley fair,
The purest, brightest gems we'll bear;
The bells shall ring their merry sound,
And o'er the distant hills around,
Where sparkling fountains gently play,
Shall sweetly float our festive lay,
Shall sweetly float our festive lay.

Haste away! Haste away!
Haste, haste, haste away!
Haste away! Haste away!
Haste, haste, haste away!

==================================
No. 28.---CHORUS OF HEATHER-BELLS.

We come from the hillside, we come from the vale,
We bring the soft kiss of the bright summer gale;
We gree you with rapture, O beautiful throng,
For we are the heather-bells---list to our song.

When falls the pale leaf from these delicate bowers,
We toll the sad knell of the innocent flowers;
But when the gay spring decks the woodland and glen,
The heather-bells blithely are chiming again;
We come from the hillside, Our queen to adorn
With hues that have slept on the bosom of morn.
With rapture we greet you, O beautiful throng,
For we are the heather-bells---list to our song.

=========================================
No. 29.---FULL CHORUS (Coronation March.)

We come from the palace, in splendor arrayed,
We come from the mountain, the forest, and glade;
We come from the cottage and meadow so green,
A chaplet to place on the brow of our queen,
A chaplet to place on the brow of our queen;

[overlapped voices]
[First]
We come... We come...
[Second]
We come from the mountain, the forest, and glade;
We come from the cottage and meadow so green;

A chaplet to place on the brow of our queen,

[First]
We come...
[Second]
We come from the palace, in splendor arrayed,
We come from the mountain, the forest, and glade;

We come,

A chaplet to place on the brow of our queen,
A chaplet to place on the brow of our queen,
We come,
We come,
We come,
We come.

======================
No. 30.---SEMI-CHORUS.

Receive thy crown, O chief of flowers;
Reign now the sovereign of these bowers,
To thee we now our tribute pay,
And willing own thy gently sway.

====================================================================
No. 31.---SEMI-CHORUS---(Heliothrope, Mignionette, Violet, and Lily)

On thy brow the crown we place,
Decked with purity and grace;
May the smile of Heaven serene,
Rest upon thee, gentle queen,
Rest upon thee, gentle queen.

No. 33.---SONG. (Rose.)

1.
Filled with gratitude and love,
E're to Him who reigns above,
For each hue that round me glows;
And the fragrance He bestows,
Grateful to each heart and voice,
That proclaim the Rose your choice.
I accept the crown which now
You have placed upon my brow,
You have placed upon my brow.

2.
Not with pride not feeling vain,
Good alone shall be my aim;
As a sacred trust to me,
Shall the crown forever be,
Thus in confidence sincere,
May we each the other cheer.
Life in sweetest union spend,
Till its fleeting moment end,
Till its fleeting moment end.

=================
No. 34.---CHORUS.

1.
We go to fulfill our glad mission to earth,
We praise the great Being who gave us our birth,
And lessons of meekness and love we impart,
As we whisper of hope to the desolate heart,
As we whisper of hope to the desolate heart,

[overlapped voices]
[First]
We go...
And our leaves are impearled with affection's warm tear,
[Second]
In the chamber of sorrow how oft we appear
We go...

[non-overlapped]
We hush the sad moanings of sickness and pain,
And restore the cheek its bright blushes again,
We go, we go, we go, we go.

2.
We smile in the palace,
We bloom in the cot,
And there in the darkness, the loveliest spot,
For we list to the prayers that eve-ning ascend,
Where peace with contentment and innocence blend,
Where peace with contentment and innocence blend,

[overlapped voices]
[First]
We go...
We tenderly bow, and we silently weep;
[Second]
O're the graves where the loved and cherished ones sleep,
We go...

[non-overlapped]
We'll ever proclaim to the creatures of earth,
The goodness of Him who has given us our birth,
We go, we go, we go, we go.

===================================
No. 35.---DUET. (Rose and Recluse.)

[RECLUSE]
I bless the Hand that kindly led
My erring steps these paths to tread,
And taught me from the simplest flower,
To trust an overruling Power,
O selfish heart repine no more,
Awake to life and zeal once more.
Now to the world I'll haste with joy,
And time in usefullness employ.
[ROSE]
Go, go, we may not bid thee stay,
The duty calls!
[RECLUSE]
and I obey.
[DUET]
May peace and joy attend thee still,
And keep thee safe from eve-ry ill,
So may we each in diff'rent ways,
Our great and good Creator praise,
May joy (peace and joy) attend thee still,
And keep thee safe from eve-ry ill,
So may (may we each) in diff'rent ways,
Our great and good Creator praise,
May peace and joy attend thee still,
And guard from eve-ry ill,
And guard from eve-ry ill.
