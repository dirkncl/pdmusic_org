                 =================

    Each child should be decorated with the flower he or she
represents.
    The Chrysanthemum may, if it is convenient, wear a Japanese
costume; but this is not necessary.
    The Hollyhock should be arrayed to look as quaint and old
fashioned as possible; and should carry a reticule or small bag
on her arm.
    The platform should be decorated with plants and flowers.
If a curtain is used the children should be discovered when it
rises.  If it is inconvenient to have a curtain, the children
may march on while the introduction is being played.
    Let speakers and singers stand well in front and give the
words so that they will be heard by the entire audience. Those
who are not accustomed to speak before are almost never heard
by all.  They think they are speaking loudly and distinctly
enough when they are not.  Great attention should be paid to
this, as the success of the Cantata depends much upon its words
being understood.

THE FESTIVAL OF THE FLOWERS.
  -------->><<----------

======================
No. 1.  INTRODUCTION.

==================================
No. 2.  COME TO US, BREATH ON US.
Chorus.

Come to us, breathe on us,
Gently pass over us.
Wind from the South that caressingly blows;
Bend to us, beckon us,
Kissing and greeting us,
Welcome the South wind, each flower that grows.
Rough are the winds from the North and the East,
Shiver the blossoms that bo 'neath the blast;
Clouds are their messengers,
Moan the trees drearily
Till the dread play of the storm-god is past.
Low in the East with the thunderheads frolicking,
Flushes the lightning, bright chain upon chain;
Hide we our little heads
Low in the flowerbeds,
While in a tempest of tears falls the rain.

Out comes the sun at last,
Warning and cheering us,
Down fall its beams in a show'r from above;
Slowly each flower-face Lifts to its dear embrace,
Once again held in the safe arms of love.

Come to us, breathe on us,
Gently pass over us.
Wind from the South that caressingly blows;
Bend to us, beckon us,
Kissing and greeting us,
Welcome the South wind, each flower that grows.

    ROSE.---Yes, the storm is past, and when the sun comes out it
always seems as though it could never again be clouded.  Here we
are, the friendly dwellers in one garden, and all awake at once,
which does not often happen.  Let us have a little festival of
thanksgiving.  What blessings are ours, brothers and sisters.
What a beautiful world it is!  What a happy thing it is to live.
How we must thank our Father every morning and evening that he
created us!

===========================================
No. 3.  LITTLE SONGSTERS FLOATING O'er US.
Song.  Rose.

Little songsters floating o'er us,
Poised on airy, lightsome wing,
Pause a moment in the treetops,
Teach the flowers how to sing.
How to sing the joy that fills us
In this crystal fragrant air,
For our hearts are filled to bursting
With a rapture we would share,
For our hearts are filled to bursting
With a rapture we would share.

Graceful butterflies, swift flitting,
Where you born on stems like ours,
Did your petals change to pinions
Just for joy of summer hours?
Were your wings clipped in the sunlight
That they wear such golden hue?
Gently kiss us, lovely cousins,
There's a tie 'twixt us---and you.

We are only little flowers,
But we grow 'neath God's dear hand,
And he sends us daily blessings,
While we beautify the land.
Warmth of sun and cooling showers,
Birds and butterflies and bees,
Let out fragrant breath send incense
Thro' the world on ev'ry breeze,
Let out fragrant breath send incense
Thro' the world on ev'ry breeze.

[CHORUS]
Oh, yes, send incense, fragrant incense,
Thro' the world on ev'ry breeze.

   ROSE (_speaks_).  Yes, every day is a festival for us.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  Do you think so?  Now it seems to me the wind
is more often from the east than from the south.  In fact
(_shaking her head_) life is full of trials.
   ROSE.  What!  For the popular and fashionable Chrysanthemum?
You suprise me!
   CHRYSANTHEMUM (_pouting_).  Yes it is.  To be sure I _am_
fashionable and I _am_ popular.  (_With the last syllable of
"popular" the piano should touch the C with which the next song
begins and Chrysanthemum should go right on with her song,
connecting closely with the spoken words_).

===========================================
No. 4.  WHEREVER THERE IS WARMTH AND LIGHT.
Song.  Chrysanthemum.

Wherever there is warmth there is light
And merry voices hum,
Wherever there is gaiety,
I'm there---chrysanthemum;
No festival can be complete
Among the rich and great,
Unless chrysanthemum shines there
In all her lovely state.

They bind me round with ribbon fine,
I hang from ev'ry wall,
I deck the tables' glitt'ring show,
I glow in lofty hall;
Above proud hearts I cling, and lie in lovely maidens' hair;
And white hands carry me around,
Their gaiety to share,
Their gaiety to share.

[CHORUS]
And white hands carry her around,
Their gaiety to share.

   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  I know this is all true, and yet---
   LILY.  Yet what?
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  I have my troubles.  Why, you would all be
jealous of me if I had but one more charm.  Why have I not a
breath as sweet even as humble mignonette there?  I am badly
treated.
   LILY.  Do you want us to be jealous of you, dear chrysanthemum?
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  Well, when one has every charm but one!
   MIGNONETTE (_gently_).  Would you take my _only_ charm?
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  To be sure that would not be very generous,
would it?
   HOLLYHOCK.  For my part I think you've been spoiled by flattery.
Look at me.  I have neither scent nor am I popular; yet I have a
good conscience, and I've seen better days.  I can assure you that
once upon a time hollyhocks stood very high in people's regard.
Now (_shrugging her shoulders_) no one pays much attention but
the bees, and they don't think much of me.

=======================
No. 5.  IN OLDEN TIMES.
Song.  Hollyhock.

1.
In olden times, in olden times
I held my head on high;
No garden could dispense with me,
And I was ne'er passed by;
Of bluest blood, they called me then,---
Alas! those days are gone.
The good old days, the best old days
The sun e're shone upon.

The bees come buzzing in my cup
Impertinent and loud,
My poor head rings with flitting wings,
I'm but one of a crowd;
They say I'm not so sweet as some,
Ransack my cup the while,
It's hard, when one has been a belle,
To treat her in that style,

2.
In olden times, in olden times
I held my head on high;
No garden could dispense with me,
And I was ne'er passed by;
Of bluest blood, they called me then,---
Alas! those days are gone.
The good old days, the best old days
The sun e're shone upon.

   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  Oh, you shouldn't complain.  You had your day.
Perhaps I shall be put in the back ground on of these days.
Meanwhile you may have found it unmixed happiness to be a belle.
I don't.
   MIGNONETTE.  You haven't told us what the trouble is.
   HOLLYHOCK.  Probably she doesn't know.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  Yes I do.  The trouble is with the people. Now
naturally I am a very tidy flower.  Every petal is in its place.
Yet mankind, those enemies to our peace, have cultivated me and
cultivated me, as they call it, until now I am almost all the time
frowsy-headed---a perfect _sight_!
   MIGNONETTE.  I noticed that you look as as though a high wind
had been blowing you.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  Just what I say; and that isn't all.  Mankind
turns me into all sorts of shapes and colors, and then not satisfied
with that they call me names.
   ALL THE FLOWERS.  What!
   CHRYSANTHEMUM (_impressively_).  Yes.  They call me a _fad_.
The fashionable fad!
   MIGNONETTE.  Poor creature.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  I don't wish to be pitied by a creature like
you---a little humble, colores thing whom nobody looks at.  After
all (_proudly_) I am the chrysanthemum---the royal flower!
   LILY.  Dear sister, you are indeed beautiful, but the charms by
which you give pleasure to mankind are not of your own making.  They
are gifts from our Father to whom you should look in thankfulness.
As for our mignonette, you are wrong to ignore her.  You appeal to
the eye, she---to the heart!   Sisters, let us tell her the story
of the little sick girl.

==========================================
No. 6.  IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS WERE FAIR.
Chorus.

1.
In summer when the days were fair
A little maid lay ill,
While other children ran and played,
She only must lie still.
The songs of birds were wafted
Thro' her window on the breeze,
And voices seemed to call her,
As they whispered in the trees.

2.
With tender hands to care for her
The little maiden lay,
All things that loving tho'ts suggest
Were bro't to speed her day.
Her gentle eyes beheld the flow'rs
That smiled beside her bed,
But best of all was mignonette,
The little suff'rer said.

3.
It lay upon her pillow white
Beside her flower-face,
The hours were not so long when it
Was close in her embrace;
It whispered of the shady spots
Where crystal waters flow,
With ev'ry fragrant breath it told
How summer breezes blow.

4.
The maid recovered, roses bloomed
In her once pallid cheek,
Again her garden knew her hand,
But 'twas the flower meek
That she most tended, loved the best
The fragrant little pet
Whose restful color blessed her eyes,
Her darling mignonette.

   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  There is another trial that I never realized
before!  Sick people do not care for me.
   ROSE.  And again you must be reminded that one flower must not
expect to combine every advantage in her one self.
   VIOLET (_timidly_).  But you do, dear Rose.
   ROSE (_smiling_).  So do you, quite as nearly.
   VIOLET (_shaking her head_).  Oh no, I'm too shy.
   HOLLYHOCK.  What are you afraid of.  Why don't you stand up and
call your soul your own.  Look at me.  I'm a hollyhock, and I don't
care who knows it.  I look over the fence and see the world.
   VIOLET (_shuddering_).  Oh, I couldn't!  I have always been so
thankful that I was given large green leaves, so I can hide under
them when I hear people coming.

=============================
No. 7.  WE LOVE MOTHER EARTH.
Semi-Chorus.  Violets.

1.
We love mother earth, we violets,
We cling to her broad kind breast,
In corners where none can find us
We love to be hidden best;
Where silvery brooklets murmur,
Is all the sound we can hear,
And woods give a welcome shelter,
Oh, there is our home so dear.

2.
The ferns lift their graceful feathers
In spots that we love to find,
The emerald moss encircles
Our feet with embraces kind;
The rough jagged rocks e'en shelter
Our tender heads from the storm,
And down thro' the woods thick covert
Comes lances of sunlight warm.

   ROSE.  Yes, you are hard to find; but people love you the
better for it.
   VIOLET.  We can not help our timid natures; but you,
beautiful rose, have no drawback.
   HOLLYHOCK.  And you aren't a fad either like some people.
   ROSE.  Do not praise me, dear friends.  You know I blush so
easily.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM.  So she does.  I wish I did.  There is another
trial that I never thought of before.  If I try to blush I get
all sorts of deep mahogany and wine colors.  I don't think any
flower is so unfortunate as I.  (_In a different tone_).  There
is one thing though that suprises me.  Rose doesn't seem to care
for flattery.  There isn't any doubt that she is a powerfull
rival of all flowers---even of me; yet she claims nothing.
I have noticed it a number of times.

=========================
No. 8.  IN PALACES GRAND.
Trio.  Hollyhock, Lily and Chrysanthemum.

HOLLYHOCK and LILY (_or Lily may take the third if her voice is
stronger, Chrysanthemum taking second._)
1.
In palaces grand where noble and great
Bring treasures from sea and from land,...
Where precious stones sparkle, rare marbles gleam white,
And splendor is on ev'ry hand;
Where melody floats on the ambient air,
And fountain-sprayed gardens are seen...
Oh, richest and rarest of all blossoms there,
Our Rose is as ever the queen, the queen,
Our Rose is as ever the queen.

CHORUS.
The years come and go with their ebb and their flow
Of fancy and fashion extreme,
And this or that flow'r is the queen of the hour,
But Rose ever reigneth supreme, supreme,
But Rose ever reigneth supreme.

2.
In lowliest cot where the laborer dwells
With little of beauty in sight....
Still lavishly opened to sun and to show'r
Our rose spreads her velvet leaves bright;
The dust of the wayside is blest by her face,
She rambles o'er rocks still serene...
So regally high or so graciously low,
None else is so worthily queen, our queen,
None else is so worthily queen.

(CHORUS.)

   ROSE.  Dear friends, I am indeed a very happy flower.  Sometime
when my companions have been broken from the stem and taken from
me it has made me sad for the moment; but life must end for us all
some time, and how much happiness comes into it for us all.  To
begin with, we can all remember when we were buds and how pleasant
it was to begin to see the world.

===========================
No. 9.  WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
Song.  Rose.

When we were young a curtain green
Shut our the sky and trees.
We used to dream while breezes rocked
Our calyx cradles safely locked
With mother Nature's keys.

What wondrous things went on within
Our little curtained beds,
We grew and grew and daily swelled
The wall that still so closely held
Our sleepy little heads,
Our sleepy little heads.

The birds sang loud,
"Come out, come out,
The sunshine is so bright,"
But our own leaflets rustling low
Said, "sleep on, babies, you shall go
When mother says 'tis right."
The great warm sun shone on and on,
And we began to hear
The voices of our lullaby
Come ever nearer and more nigh
With sound more sweet and clear.

At last a sunbeam's gentle touch,
As it was passing by,
Unclasped our curtain,
"Wake and see the world without," it cried, and we
Looked up into the sky,
Looked up into the sky,
Oh, blissful moment ne're to forget,
When calyxes unfurled,
We turned our petals to the sun,
And knew that life had just begun
In this fair summer world,
In this fair summer world.

   LILY.  Yes, it is a fair world even to those of us who get
broken from the stem; for the flowers that are gathered have
wonderful adventures.  One of my sisters was taken from my side
a few days ago, and this morning, all wilted, she was dropped
near me in the garden, and before she went to sleep she told me
her story.  She had been to a beautiful wedding, and was happy
and proud of the distinction she had enjoyed.

=====================================
No. 10.  THE FLOWER CUPS ARE SWINGING.
Chorus.

1.
The flower cups are swinging
Like wedding bells a-ringing
When like a lily fair a white-robed bride gives heart and hand,
And with the music pealing
The incense sweet is stealing,
The perfume that is God's own gift in all the fruitful land.

2.
We follow her with blessing,
Her very feet caressing,
As down the flow'r-strewn aisle her maiden steps the last time go;
While organ tones are pealing
With deep and tender feeling,
And love in ev'ry heart brings heav'n a while on earth below.

3.
Long life, O lovely maiden,
The very air is laden
With wishes for your happiness as long as life shall last;
And may the flow'rs you're treading
So lightly at your wedding
Be symbols of the joys the years shall on your pathway cast.

   ROSE.  I had a sister who once went once more to a baby's funeral.
   VIOLET.  Ah, I love babies.  I am not afraid of them.  It is sad
to think one should die.
   ROSE.  Sad for a little while; but I thought you knew, Violet,
that only seems to be death.  Death really means life to babies
just as it does to us.

=================================
No. 11.  O STOP, SOFT BREEZES.
Duet.

(_Two or three voices on a part_).
1.
O stop, soft breezes, a-while your playing,
A soul has passed away....
So pure its beauty, so fit for heaven,
We could not bid it stay....
In gardens fair where no chill winds blowing
Can blight its beautiful life...
Divinest tenderness guides its growing
Afar from pain and strife.

2.
O violets, gather near eyes of azure
Whose lids are closed in sleep...
And roses lie near the cheek so pallid
That used your blush to keep....
Sweet lilies rest on the breast all pulseless,
Where innocence e'er held reign...
And lie in hands whose dear baby fingers
Will ne'er unclose again.

3.
Oh, sweet soul drawn from the world's fierce battle,
You'll ne'er know want nor cold....
But bending o'er those who held you, treasured
You'll draw them to the fold....
The Savior promised, 'A child shall lead them,'
So lead with heavenly art...
Until in glory and cloudless sunshine
We greet thee, heart to heart.

   BUTTERCUP.  I'm sure we all love children.  Who give us a
warmer welcome when we first peep out in the spring?  We flowers
of the fields and meadows know what it is to enjoy childrens'
romps.

===================================
No. 12.  HERE THEY COME ROLLICKING.
Chorus.

1.
Here they come rollicking, here they come frollicking,
Springtime and children all laughing together.
Thro' the long meadow grass look as they fleetly pass,
Shouting for joy in the sunshiny weather.

2.
Do you love butter, the sweet voices utter, while
Buttercups yellow each chin's now reflecting;
Quick comes the gay reply, yes we do, you and I,
Golden and bright, jast as we were expecting.

3.
Nature with joy is rife, each field so full of life,
Brooks running free after long winter's sleeping.
What wonder children gay romp all the happy day,
Knowing no rest till the stars down are peeping.

4.
Tucked in their little beds, all the dear sleepy heads
Long for the morn to begin the day over;
Light feet and sparkling eyes dance 'neath the summer skies,
As the birds sing and the bees seek the clover.

   ROSE.  Yes, we all testify to the same thing. Blessing and
happiness.
   CHRYSANTHEMUM (_aside_).  And these sister flowers have
taught me a lesson.  They find as much happiness, even the wild
flowers, as I do, perhaps more.  No one complains but me.  The
little festival has taught me to live in my joys and not to hunt
for causees for discontent.

=====================================
No. 13.  THERE'S A STILL SWEET VOICE.
Song.  Chrysanthemum.

1.
There's a still sweet voice that we all may hear
If we list to its pleading tone,
To each drooping heart now it says---"look up
And no longer make selfish moan."
If some bitter drops are within your cup,
Neither bitter nor sweet will stay,
And the journey brightens as the time sweeps on,
If we live in our joys today,
And the journey brightens as the time sweeps on,
If we live in our joys today.

2.
There's a threat'ning cloud in the brooding sky,
Yet a rift of the blue is there,
O'er a trustful heart let the tempest rage,
There is One who will help you bear.
Black of blackest clouds shines the golden sun,
As it shineth for aye-eth for aye and aye,
There is comfort always for him who seeks
And will live in his joys today,
There is comfort always for him who seeks
And will live in his joys today.

   LILY.  I think we all appreciate the blessings granted
to the flowers; yet it does us good to name them sometimes
as we have to-day.  The best of all we have none of us yet
mentionedl; and yet we know to whom we owe our lives.  When
man, our master, praises his Creatorm does he not consider
that our beauty and fragrance are worthy to adorn the place
of worship?  Ah, my brothers and sisters, let this realization
be the crowning thought of our festival.  In the churches,
dedicated to the loving Father of all, we find the highest
and holiest use which God grants to his flowers.

===========================================
No. 14.  NOW WITH FAINT HEARTS FULL OF JOY.
Chorus and Obligato.  Rose.

[CHORUS]
Now with hearts full of joy and gladness
Gather round, all ye flow'rs, and sing,
For in God's own house is our festival,
And his praises again we'll bring...
His praises again we'll bring.
Wondrous mercies we must acknowledge
In the garden, the field and wood,
From the hand of Him who created all,
And in love has pronouced them good.

Oh the glory and joy of the summer,
Time of song and of melody,
What a chorus of happy creatures
Lift their voices in rhapsody!
Ev'ry tired heart may gain new vigor
In the field 'neath the spreading trees,
From the life that infills all Nature,
And rejoices in ev'ry breeze,
And rejoices in ev'ry breeze.

[ROSE]
Now with hearts of joy, with hearts full of joy...
[CHORUS]
Now with hearts full of joy and
[ROSE]
joy and

[CHORUS and ROSE with overlapping parts]
[ROSE]
gladness
Gather round and sing...
In God's own house
our festival,
And his praises bring,
And his praises bring,
His praised bring,
His wondrous mercies
we must acknowledge
In garden fair, in garden, field and wood
The hand of Him
created all,
In love pronouced, pronounced them good,
To his name be thankful praise, be praise
Now and evermore.
Amen, Amen...
Amen....
[CHORUS]
gladness
Gather round, all ye flow'rs, and sing,
For in God's own house is our festival,
And his praises again will bring,
His praises again we'll bring,
Wondrous mercies we must acknowledge,
In the garden, the field and wood,
From the land of Him who created all,
And in love had pronouced them good,
To his name be thankful praise
Now and evermore.
Amen, (Amen, Amen, Amen,)
Amen....
