                                 --------------------
No. 1.  CHORUS. (Puritans).  "How long, O how long."
(_They were persecuted and oppressed for conscience' sake._)

How long, O how long shall oppresssions's dark night
Enshroud, like a pall, to dimay and affright;
In sadness we mourn, and in grief we complain;
The tears we have shed, must we weep them in vain---
O freedom, where are thou, say, is there no rest?
No refuge for those who are wronged and oppressed;
No arm can shield us from tyranny's sway---
Or must we in silence and meekness obey?
How long,
How long....

No. 2.  SOLO. (Captain).  "O deep and bitter is the hate."

Oh! deep and bitter is the hate our foes
Do bear us in this land of strife;
And cold, and dark, and deep its tide of woes,
Which onward rolls to quence our life.
O, that we knew some place of calm repose,
Tho' lonesome wild, or desert bleak,
So would we fly the bitter storm that blows,
And thither haste a rest to seek.
So would we fly the storm that blows,
And thither haste a rest... to seek.

No. 3.  CHORUS.  (Puritans).  "Our faith, our hope."
(_They resolved to seek liberty of conscience in a distant land._)

Our faith, our hope, our all we cast
On Him whose word can never fail,
He will defend us to the last,
Nor shall our haughty foes prevail;
Then let us in His strength arise,
And bid our home and friends farewell---
A distant land in beauty lies
Far o'er yon waste of waters blue,
Far o'er yon waste of waters blue.

Then let us seek her tranquil shore,
And breathe the pure, untainted air,
For we our vows to Heaven may poor,
And worship unmolested there,
And worship unmolested there.

Then let us in his strength arise.

No. 4.  SOLO.  (Sister of the Captain), "Dear home, farewell."

1.
Dear Home, farewell! dear home, farewell!
While down my cheek the silent tear is stealing,
The pensive sadness of my heart revealing,
How do I gaze on thee with fondest feeling:
Dearest home, farewell!

Ah, dearest home, farewell!
Dear home, farewell!
Dear home, farewell!

2.
How we must part, now we must part;
Along the shore the wintry winds are sighing,
And far away upon the ocean flying,
Still will I pray for thee with love undying:
Dearest home, farewell!

Ah, dearest home, farewell!
Dear home, farewell!
Dear home, farewell!

No. 5.  SEMI-CHORUS.  (On the Shore.)  "The Lord our God."
(_The Pastor and others remained behind._)

He will both grace and glory give;
And no good thing will be with-hold,
From them who by His counsels live.

No. 6.  SEMI-CHORUS.  (On the Ship.)  "Hope we in God."
(_They were cheerful and hopeful in view of their voyage._)

Hope we in God, our God forever:
He will forsake His heritage never,
And tho' our kindred ties we sever,
Far from the land we cherished to roam,
Strong in His strength, His love possessing,
Still shall our lips, His mercy addressing,
Humbly invoke His richest blessing,
Ever to rest on thee, our home.

No. 7.  SEMI-CHORUSSES.  (Together.)  "The Lord our God," and "Hope we in God."

Hope we in God, our God forever,
He will forsake His heritage never,
And tho' our kindred ties we sever,
Far from the land we cherished to roam,
Strong in his strength, His love possessing,
Still shall our lips His mercy addressing,
Humbly invoke His richest blessing,

[CHORAL: Baritone, Alto, Bass]
The Lord our God's a sun and shield,
And He will grace and glory give,
And no good thing will He with-hold
From them who by his counsels live.

2.
[1st. Sop., 2nd Sop., Tenor]
Hearts that for us are fondly glowing,
Voices whose tones are tenderly flowing,
Fainter yon choral sounds are growing,
Lost in the waves' tumultuos swell,
Quickly recedes the land that bore us,
Fading away in distance before us,
God is our shield, His smile is o'er us:
Land of our birth, farewell! farewell!
[CHORAL: Baritone, Alto, Bass]
The Lord our God's a sun and shield,
And He will grace and glory give,
And no good thing will He with-hold

No. 8.  QUARTETTE.  (Sailors).  "Roll on, majestic Ocean."
(_The sailors song of their love for the ocean._)

[TTBB]
1.
Roll on, roll on, majestic ocean,
Where wave to wave is gently sighing;
How dost thou swell the soul's devotion,
As o'er thy breast our bark is flying,
As o'er thy breast our bark is flying.

Now the whispers of the night
O'er thy pensive waters glide,
And the moon's celestial light
Smiles upon thy silvery tide.
Boundless deep,
Lovely deep,
When the gentle breezes sweep,
How we love thee--yes we love thee,
Boundless deep,
Bound-...less...deep....

2.
When o'er our heads the lightning flashes,
And sea and sky with fury blending;
When peal on peal of thunder crashes,
Our shattered sail in pieces rending,
Our shattered sail in pieces rending.

When the sailor to the mast
Clings amid the howling blast,
And within his bosom's cell
Hope and fear alternate dwell.
Rolling deep,
Stormy deep,
When the angry tempests sweep,
Still we love thee---yes, we love thee,
Mighty deep,
Might-...y...deep....

No. 9.  SOLO.  (Elder's Daughter.)  "What grief and sorrow this."
(_A death and burial occurred at sea._)

[Recitative.]
Tears that tell the heart's deep agony---
Lo! in our midst death comes with noiseless tread---
And cold and still his victim lies.

Prepare we now with solemn rites to pay
Our last sad tribute of affection true,
Let holy awe each stricken bosom fill,...
It is our Father's voice that speaks, "Be still."

No. 10.  CHORUS.  "Farewell, departed one."
(_Their trust and confidence, even in affliction, were unabated._)

1.
Farewell, departed one,
From thee we sever,
Though here thy work is done,
Part we forever.
No, on that ra-diant shore,
Where thou hast gone before,
There we shall part no more,
Never, O, never.

2.
Though in thy ocean granve
Deep thou art lying,
And the foamcrested wave
O'er thee is sighing,
Swift to the realms of light
Thy soul has winged its flight,
Tasting, with angels bright,
Rapture undying.

No. 11.  SOLO.  (Elder.)  "Through many a weary day."
(_The voyage was long and stormy, and they were driven out of their course._)

Through many a weary day and toilsome night,
These trackless waters hath our vessel swept,
And we have seen the majesty unveiled,
The wondrous works of Him who form'd the deep,
And fixed th'e-ter-nal bounds it may not pass.

Storm after storm, terrific, o'er our heads
Hath rent the heavens, while on the boiling tide,
by mad-d'ning winds and waves gigantic tossed,
Through perils dire our devious course hath been.

And whither now at last we may be driven,
Or to what port, alas! we cannot tell;
Yet is our faith unshaken, and our trust fixed on Rock of Ages.

No. 12  SOLO.  (Elder's Son) and CHORUS.  "The land! The land!"
(_They sailed for Virginia, but first discovered land to the northward._)

The land! The land!
O joyful, joyful sight!
(The land! The land!)
Far in the distance, like a heavy cloud,
There seems a forest deep of stately pines,
Clad in winter's snowy robes.

[CHORUS]
The land! The land! The land! O joyful sight!
(Far in) O joyful, joyful (the) sight! (distance, like a cloud,)
The (O) land! (joyful,) joyful sight!

[SOLO]
Nearer and nearer yet, with steady helm,
Our onward course we keep,
Our onward course we keep:
[CHORUS, with much overlap among voices]
Nearer and nearer yet, with steady helm,
Our onward course we keep,
Our onward course we keep:

No. 13.  QUINTETTE.  "On the Land."
(_They landed at a place, afterwards called Plymouth._)

[Daughter, Sister, Son, Captain, Elder]
[Overlapping voices]
On the land, On the land, On the land....

1.
Wearied, with woes oppressed,
Here may we find a rest,
On freedom's shore;
Proudly we look on thee,
Bright orb of liberty;
These sacred wilds shall be
Thine evermore.

2.
Tho' hardships be our lot,
Safe in this hallowed spot,
Will we abide;
Here will we joyful sing
Praise to our God and King,
While the glad echoes ring
Far, far, and wide.

3.
Welcome, disease and pain,
Hope shall the heart sustain,
Thro' the deep gloom;
Tho' dangers may increase,
Tho' life itself should cease,
Here will we rest in peace---
Welcome the tomb.

No. 14.  CHORUS. "Now let each grateful heart."
(_They gave thanks for their preservation and success._)

1.
Now let each grateful heart and voice
The full united chorus join,
And though with trembling we rejoice,
We bless a Providence divine.

2.
For He in safety o'er the main
Has kindly brought our little band,
And still His goodness will sustain
His people in a distant land.

                                 --------------------
No. 15.  SEMI-CHORUS.  (Indians).  "Who are these before us."
(_The Indians were filled with amazement at the appearance of the strangers._)

1.
Who are these before us,
Tho' the dim woods moving?
Come they from the spirit's home,
O'er the waters roving?
Are they clothed in terror,
These mysterious legions,
Brought in clouds with fearful wings,
From the shadowy regions.

2.
Strange in form and feature,
Faces pale and shining---
Come they from the spirit world,
Mortal thoughts divining?
Are they clothed in terror,
These mysterious legions,
Brought in clouds with fearful wings,
From the shadowy regions.

No. 16.  SOLO. (Indian.)  "They are not friends."
(_The Indians instigated to enmity by one of their number._)

[Recitative: Baritone]
They are not friends, but enemies;
They come to take our hunting grounds;
Already have they trod on the graves of our fathers;
Rouse we and destroy them!
Rouse we and destroy them!
Are we not strong and fearless as an eagle in its course?

No. 17.  SEMI-CHORUS. (Indians.)  "Onward to destroy them."

Onward, to destroy them,
With a mighty slaughter,
Swiftly as the torrent
Rush we to the foe,
Yes, onward to destroy them,
With a mighty slaughter,
Swiftly as the torrent
Rush we to the foe,
With the hatchet gleaming,
With the bow, the bow and quiver,
They shall fall, shall fall before us:
Strike the fatal blow.

No. 18.  QUARTETTE.  (Puritans.)  "Softly the day declining."
(_An evening hymn by a family in the Puritan settlement._)

1.
Softly the day declining,
Fades from our sight;
While early stars are shining,
Tenderly bright,
Smiles the blue arch of Heaven
O'er earth and sea;
Rest to the heart is given,
From labor free.

2.
Gently while the nature slumbers,
Our hymn of praise,
Fervent in grateful numbers
To God we raise;
Safe in His strength reposing,
Rest we secure;
His love our hopes enclosing,
Faithful and sure.

No. 19.  SOLO.  (Captain.)  "Arise, arise, the foe is near."
(_They were alarmed by the warlike demonstations of the Indians._)

Arise, arise, the foe is near,
In the depths of the forest they are gathered,
And terrible is their fury;
Hasten to surprise them,
Hasten to suprise them,
Ere they burst upon us.

No. 20.  SEMI-CHORUS.  (Puritans.)  "Prepare we for battle."

[TTB]
Prepare for battle, though dread foes are near us,
Our God is the shield and the hope of the brave;
We'll fearlessly fight for our homes and our loved ones,
Still trusting in Him who is mighty to save.

Then gird on the air the armor, courageously meeting
The dangers that threaten our hopes to o'erthrow,
The star, which the warcloud in gloom now is veiling,
In triumph shall shine on the vanquished and low.

Prepare for battle, though dread foes are near us,
Our God is the shield and the hope of the brave;
We'll fearlessly fight for our homes and our loved ones,
Still trusting in Him who is mighty to save.

No. 21.  DUETT.  (Elder's Daughter and Sister.)  "They are gone."
(_The women were terrified in view of their defenceless situation._)

They are gone,
They are gone,
To the distant forest dark and deep;
And their voices growing fainter,
As their wild and dangerous course they keep,
O, have we left our home,
By cruel hands to perish here?
Alas! no help can come,
To save from harm the loved ones dear,

1.
Alas! no help!
Alas! no help!
To save from harm the loved ones dear.

2.
Alas! no help!
Alas! no help!
To save from harm the loved ones dear.

No. 22.  SOLO.  (Elder.)  "Wherefore are ye thus disheartened?"
(_He exhorts them to trust and condifence._)

Wherefore are ye disheartened?
Why of mortal foes afraid?
God is able to subdue them,
And afford His people aid.
Courage then, His promise trusting,
Tho' the waves of trouble swell;
He will be our strength and tower,
Who in all things guideth well,
He will be our strength and tower,
Who in all things guideth well.

No. 23.  CHORUS.  (Puritans.)  "We have triumphed."
(_The Puritans were successful in their encounters with the Indians._)
(_The men's voices are heard in the distance, gradually approaching._)

We have triumphed, (Hark!)
We have triumphed, (Hark!)
We have triumphed gloriously!
They come, (We have triumphed,) yes,
We have triumphed,
And the savage foemen flee! (They come,)
They are scattered, (joy,)
They are scattered, (joy,)
Thro' the forest far and wide;
They come, (They are scattered,) joy,
They are scattered, (joy,)
They are scattered (joy,)
On the distant mountain side. (they come.)
Strong (We have) is (triumphed) the arm
(We have triumphed,) of our
(And our foes are fled,) Deliv'rer,
(And our foes are fled.)
Strong (We have triumphed,) is the arm
(We have triumphed,) of our
(And our foes are fled.) Deliv'rer.
We have triumphed. (And our foes are fled.)

No. 24.  SEMI-CHORUS.  (Indian.)  "No more, no more, 'tis useless to contend."
(_The Indians desire peace._)

[TTB]
No more, no more, 'tis useless to contend,
Bury the hatchet, let the battle end---
'Tis the Great Spirit sends them to our shore;
They are His children; we rebel no more;
Do they not hold the thunder in their hand?
The lightning flashes at their dread command,
At their dread command, their dread command.
[BARITONE (Solo)]
Let the council-fire be lighted,
And the storm of anger cease,
Let our brothers there assemble,
And receive the hand of peace,

We'll war with the forest, our conquering stroke
Shall sever the heart of the sturdy oak,
And the stately elm on the mountain's brow,
And the wild, dark pine in the strength shall bow:
Here shall the home of our children be,
And our children's children shall here be free,
And a mighty nation shall yet repose,
Where the tree we have planted its shadow throws.
Here shall the exile find rest,
And the stranger in far off lands oppressed,
Shall leave his sorrows and cares behind,
Sweet freedom and peace in this land to find.
