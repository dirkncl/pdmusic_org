[Source: pages 74-77 from "The Academy Vocalist"]

Have you ever heard the echoes 
That sleep in yonder hill, 
Embowered in the greenwood 
So shady and so still? 

Oh, yes, we’ve heard the echos 
That sleep in yonder hill, 
Embowered in the greenwood 
So shady and so still. 

Will they answer to our call, 
To our tones returning sing? 

They will answer to our call, 
And sweetest music bring. 

Echo, echo, echo, echo, 
Answer us again, 
Answer us again. 
Wake the echoes far and wide, 
From forest, hill and mountain side, 
Let their softened numbers flow 
Thro’ the wood and vale below; 

Wake the echoes, wake the echoes, 
wake the echoes, wake the echoes, 
Hear their softened numbers flow, 
Thro’ the wood and vale beelow, vale below, 
Thro’ the wood and vale below, vale below.
