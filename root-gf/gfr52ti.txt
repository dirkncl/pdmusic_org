from page 49 of "The Academy Vocalist"

1.
Come and join us, dear companions,
Come and join our happy throng;
Here we’ll blend our hearts and voices
In the dear delights of song.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Yes, we’ll come and join the chorus;
Yes, we’ll swell the happy throng;
Here we’ll blend our hearts and voices
In the dear delights of song.

2.
Joy is hov’ring o’er the valley,
Rush-ing in the waterfalls;
Joy in lighted halls is beaming
And within our circle calls.
