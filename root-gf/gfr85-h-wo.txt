1. Scorn not the slightest word or deed,
Nor deem it void of power;
There's fruit in each wind-wafted seed
That waits its natal hour.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Work on, (Work on,) work on, (work on,)
Tho' small thy act may be,
Its power for good in time to come
Thy God alone can see.

2. A whispered word may touch the heart,
And call it back to life:
A look of love bid sin depart,
And still unholy strife.

3. No act falls fruitless; none can tell
How vast its power may be,
Now what results infolded dwell
Within it silently.
