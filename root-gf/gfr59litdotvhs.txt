For a year or more before his death Mr. Woodbury was suffer-
ing under a attack of pulmonary disease, then the progress of which
he retarded by great efforts and sacrifices. He sought relief in the
gentle clime of Italy and in the air of the beautiful country of
the Nile but in vain. He returned to his native land and breathed
his last on his way to the South where he hoped at least to
prolong his life during one more winter.

1. Low in the dust of the valley he sleeps,
With the wand'rings of life he is done.
From the sorrows of earth he is free, his is free,
And before us is safely at home.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
"Strike the harp gently" mournful be the strain,
For his "Gentle words and loving smiles"
Will greet us ne'er again.

2. Sad was his heart as he wandered away,
Driven far from his country to roam,
But his life ever said what his song sweetly sung O
"Be kind to the loved ones at home."

3. Far from the home of his loved ones dear,
In the land of the stranger he fell,
But the heart full of faith met the summons with joy
From the One "who all things doeth well."
