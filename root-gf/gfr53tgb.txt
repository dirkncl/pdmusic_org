1. 
The Greenwood Bell tolls ONE, 
List to its mournfull swell, 
A race is early run, 
’Tis a lovely infant’s knell; 
Slow and sad its members stealing 
To each gentler thought appealing 
By its plaintive swell. 
Mortals to the sound attending, 
List the solemn peal ascending:

[Refrain][sung after each verse]
Hear the Greenwood Bell,
Hear the Greenwood Bell. 

2. 
Again that sound we hear, 
Another soul has fled, 
In manhood’s bright career, 
They lay him with the dead; 
Yet tho’ all that here we cherish, 
Most in one short momemt perish, 
Shall we dare rebel! 
Nor a promise sweet is given, 
Of a mansion bright in heaven:

3. 
Hark! hark! it tolls again, 
A youth has pass’d away; 
Each earthly hope, how vain, 
It blooms but to decay! 
Tho’ with fondest purest pleasure, 
We may hold some precious treasure 
In our bosoms cell, 
Death is lurking near us ever, 
And the dearest link will sever:

4. 
And once again that sound 
Rings on the twilight air 
An aged one hath found 
A rest from toil and care 
Slow and sad its numbers stealing 
Waking evry holier feeling 
By its plaintive swell 
Mortals to the sound attending, 
While with notes of sorrow blending:
