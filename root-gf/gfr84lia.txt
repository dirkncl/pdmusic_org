"Love in All" (1884)
Words by C. J.
[Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895]

Give relative and absolute names.
Let Tenor, Alto and Base come in without loosing the beat.
Be sure and sing syllables, each part alone first,
in all these lessons.

1. Name the leaves on all the trees,
Name the waves on all the seas,
All the flow’rs, by rill that blow,
All the mryiad tints that glow;
All the meads where on the wing,
Bright bees hum and linnets sing,
Name all sounds of field and grove,
And you name the name of Love.

CHORUS 1
Yes, from love all beauty springs,
’Tis of love all nature sings;
’Twas by love, creation first
Into glorious being burst.

2. Go where, thro’ the voiceless night,
Trips from Luna’s silver light;
Hear of Nature’s pulse the beat,
Like the tread of unseen feet;
While the silv’ry dewdrops fall,
While the shadows rest o’er all,
Holy nature veils her face,
Earth is lost in Heav’n’s embrace.

CHORUS 2
Love eternal spreads her wings
Over all created things;
Spirit sweet, all else above,
Love is God, since God is Love.
