Poetry by
Mrs. Marr Ann Whitaker.

[Source: "The Silver Chime," pages 94-128]

The following Cantata may be sung book in hand, with the 
children arranged in the usual way as a choir, or it may
be committed to memory, and receive some additional 
interest by observing a plan similar to the one here 
proposed.  Have banners, or cards prepared, with the names 
of the characteristics personified by the semi-choruses 
printed upon them.  Let the sticks to which they are 
attached be light, and long enough to rest upon the floor, 
that it may be easy and graceful for the children to hold 
them while singing.  The banners for the solos should be a 
little larger , and stand a little higher than the others, 
and of these Charity should be a little the highest.  If 
more uniformity is desired than the banners will make, each
semi-chorus may have some distinguishing badge or dress, but 
this is not necessary.  Faith may have the figure of a cross, 
and Hope of an anchor, somewhere upon their dresses. Charity 
will need no emblem except the crown or wreath which will be 
placed upon her head during the singing.  It is supposed that 
they are in every Sabbath school young ladies who could take 
these solo parts.  They are rather too difficult for children. 
It will be seen that there are ten banners in each semi-chorus. 
If there are more than forty singers, it will be a good plan 
for those who do not hold banners to join the various semi-
choruses as companions.  When the children  take their places, 
let the A semi-chorus stand on the right, B on the left. The 
other semi-choruses in the center.B next to A and D next to C. 
Faith, Hope and Charity should stand in the fromt—Charity in 
the center. The solos and semi-chorus should step forward, as 
they sing their parts, and back to place when they finish.  If 
desired, the accompaniest can play some appropriate piece 
while the choir are assembling.  If the place is favorable 
they might march in.  Let the first chorus follow the Intro-
duction in time.  The chorus and semi-chorus are written in 
two parts, but it is expected that generally but two will be 
sung  The bass will, however, sound well sung in the con-
tralto voice , that is, an octave higher than it is written, 
and played.  Connect the pieces smoothly together.  In No. 1 
let a few voices sing the semi-chorus.  Provision is made in 
No. 16 for a march, which may be long or short, simple or 
complicated, as circumstances may decide.  If long, the music 
may be repeated, or another march may be added by the player. 
The marching should commence to the instrumental march, and 
continue through the first verse of the chorus.  At the 
commencement of the second verse the choir should be in their 
first position.  At the words, “Receive now thy crown,” Faith 
and Hope should place a wreath or crown upon Charity’s head, 
and at the word “crown,”  all should bow.  So all should bow 
again at the word “greeting,” and again at the word “crown,” 
which follows in the next line.  At the third verse the 
marching may be resumed, and continued through the verse.  At 
the Finale the semi-choruses step forward in turn and sing, 
after which full chorus.

And millions shall echo the story.

Where all is pure and fair,
Where all is pure and fair.

From love’s free living spring,
Let none refuse the blessed gift,
The precious offering;
Stern pride and anger then will die,
Quench’d by that stream divine,
And from the heav’nenkindled eye 
Bright rays of mercy shine,

To thee alone ’tis given
The fallen spirit up to lift,

When burning teardrops flow,

From the happy world above.
Lo! Lo! Lo! the glorious light appears.

Darkness, Hatred reign no more,
For Immanuel comes to vanquish

Make on earth thy blest abode.
Lo! Lo! Lo! the glorious light appears.

Life divine His words impart,
And the strength he gives shall enter

To make the vict'ry sure.

And mourn, and mourn for thee,
And mourn, and mourn for thee.

To bless, to bless thee now,
To bless, to bless thee now.

Awaits the soul of man,

To sin, despair and woe.

And smiles on all below.

Then will we battle for the right,
There will we bring false deeds to light,
There will we strike with pow'r and might
For truth and God.

And feebly try to fly,

Where evil wileds, with iron arm,
His scimitar of fear.

In notes of fervent praise.

1. Where'ver in rev'rent quietude
The mind is lowly bending,
And 'neath Earth's solemn mysteries
The eagle-glance decending,
When from the silent deeps of tho't
Truth's spirit-voice is calling,
And on the ardent waiting soul
Her inspiration falling.
There will we sing
His lofty name,
Who called to life
Earth's wondrous frame.

2. Where'ver the fond, enraptur'd eye
Drinks in all holy beauty,
While heart of man to Nature's heart
Respongs in love and duty,
Where hoarry mountains rear their heads 
In strength sublime reposing,
Or vales of tranquil loveliness
Their flow'ry eyes are closing,
Theer will we draw
All hearts above,
To sing his pow'r,
His boundless love.

3. Where genius, star of mighty mind,
O'er newborn thought is pouring
A flood of heav'nly, radiant light,
God's world to man restoring,
Now burning on the poet's page,
Or from, the canvas glowing,
Now where the silent marble breathes
Or music's life is flowing,
There will we point
To Him afar,
Great sourch of light,
Bright morning star.

No. 16. FULL CHORUS. (March.) “The Trumpet is sounding.”

1. The trumpet is sounding-- our banner unfurled,
Come forth at the glad, thrilling call,

With faith to uphold us, and Hope for our guide,
In triumph and pow'r will we go.

For right will the wrong overthow.

O Charity, none like to thee,
Fair sov'reign of graces-- receive now the crown,

Receive thou our greeting, receive thou thy crown
Thou chief of the bright, blessed three.

3. Now on to the conflict, on, on to the strife,
For holy the war that we wage,
Our hearts ever strengthen'd by Faith, Hopw, and Love,

Come forth at the glad, thrilling call;
Our cause, it is sacred, and righteous, and true, 
Then on, noble hearts, one and all.

“Ye valiant hearts and true.”

1. Ye valliant hearts and true,
Press firmly, gladly on,
The conflict waits for your,
The vict'ry must be won.
Tho' long and fierce the strife,
Tho' strong the foes ye meet,
Fear not for earth's new life
At last your eyes will greet.

2. O tried and faithful souls, 
Content with pain or loss, 
Who welcome trial's darts, 
And onward bear the cross,
Look up! your strength is there,
Your foes shall surely fall, 
Still on your true cross bear,
Its pow'r will crush them all.

3. Brave hearts, by duty bound,
Ye hold the magnet-line
Whose touch, the wide world round
Will thrill with love divine.
When he who called us forth,
His ministers to be,
Shall claim his throne on earth,
Earth purified and free.

Help, help us, lift from earth her veil of night.

He comes! He comes! Messiah, Prince of peace,
On earth, earth to reign in glory now,
To burst all bonds, all prisoned souls release,
Come forth, come forth, before His footstool bow.
