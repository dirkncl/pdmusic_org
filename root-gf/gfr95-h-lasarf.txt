1. Like a strong and raging fire,
In a narrow furnace pent
Glows the Sacred Heart’s desire
In the Holy sacrement;
[DUET]
Round that sacred furnace thronging
Shall these hearts refuse to burn?
Heart of love and tender longing
Shall we make thee to return?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Bending low in adoration,
While our souls are borne above,
’Twill be sweeter far to wear it,
Than a crown of fairest flowers.

2. ’Twas to cast abroad love’s fire
That our God from heaven came;
May those sparks our love inspire;
May we burn with that blest flame.
[DUET]
All our sins, our slights, our coldness
All our insults we deplore,
Pardon, Lord, our daring boldness,
We will never wound Thee more.

3. Blessed Lord; Thy heart is cloven
With the cross of bitter woe,
There are thorns around it woven
And the blood drops from it flows;
[DUET]
Let us take Thy cross and bear it,
Let Thy thorny crown be ours,
’Twill be sweeter far to wear it
That a crown of fairest flowers.
