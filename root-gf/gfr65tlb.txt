1. 
On a mountain whose cloudpiercing summit appeared 
Like a throne for the stormking by whirlwinds upreared, 
Dwelt an eagle, and long had his proud form outrode 
The storms that swept over his mountain abode. He had for a century breasted their power, 
And his flight was more noble since each than before; 
Through all that wide  region his fame had been heard 
And they called that proud eagle the Liberty Bird.

2. 
A small crawling reptile by some means had made
Its home in the cleft of the rock, ’neath the shade
Of the mountain bird’s nest; and the eagle disdained
That his beak by its ignoble blood should be stained.
Secured in contempt— more noble than wise
It flourished and grew to a serpent in size;
Till it dreamed in its malice by jealousy stirred,
Of humbling the pride of the Liberty Bird.

3. 
The eagle sat perched in his glory on high,
When the reptile came forth his fierce power to defy;
And, hissing its serpentine venom and spite,
Approached the bold eagle’s precipitous height,
While the eagle looked scornfully down on his foe,
Till the reptile at length was directly below;
Then he spread his broad wings & his wild scream was heard,
And into midair sprang the Liberty Bird.

4. 
A moment he poised on his aerial height,
Then downward he swooped like the gleaming of light;
The treacherous snake in his talons he clutched,
While his proud plumage fluttered aloft all untouched;
Its vitals, its heart, from its bosom he tore,
Then spurned the base carcase and heav’nward did soar;
And the wild notes of freedom in triumph were heard
Bursting forth from the throat of the Liberty Bird.
