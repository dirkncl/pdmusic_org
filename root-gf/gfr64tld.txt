1.
I know a fairy bower within the leafy dell,
Where 'mid the woodbine arches the merry song birds dwell.
'Tis sweet to hear their music, secure from summer's heat,
And pass the noontide hours within their cool retreat.
O come then to the bower within the leafy dell,
Where 'mid the woodbine arches the merry song birds dwell.

2.
The wild rose blushes sweetly, and lifts her perfum'd head
When morning wakes from slumber, and hours of night are fled.
The sunshine tries how vainly, to peep amid the trees,
Within these woodbine arches that Nature brightly weaves.
O come then to the bower within the sylvan dell,
Where Nature's robes are brightest and merry song birds dwell.
