"The Gates of Song" (1884)
Words and Music by
George Frederick Root, 1820-1895

Tenor begins with do, Alto with mi, Soprano do, 
and Base do.  Syllables first.  Never mind the 
“why’s and wherefore’s;” just sing it. When no 
dynamic marks are given, the words indicate 
power and quality.

1. Enter now the gates of song,
All who to our ranks belong;
Let each column find its place;
Treble, Tenor, Alto, Base.

2. Independent each must be,
Yet the four must all agree;
For we’re all in one embrace;
Treble, Tenor, Alto, Base.

3. So together we must go
With the measures’s even flow;
All, or none, will win the race;
Treble, Tenor, Alto, Base.
