by Frank Howard
[pseud. for Delos Gardner Spalding, 1833-1884]
Arranged by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
from "Songs of Sundown!"

1.
In a tree near the porch
Sang a little bird,
Pit, pit, pat, on the roof
Drops of rain I heard,
Merry sounded ev're tone,
Full of joy seemed he.
Sitting singing all alone,
And winking down at me;
Oh, while the drops on him fell,
Cheerful was his strain,
On the tree full of glee,
Singing in the rain.

CHORUS
Singing, swinging,
singing sweetly a joyful strain.
Singing, swinging,
singing in the rain.
Singing, swinging,
singing sweetly a joyful strain.
Singing, swinging,
singing in the rain.

2.
Dark the sky over head,
Dreary sighed the tree,
As the wind sadly moan'd
Sweeter still sang he,
Though the sun thro' cloud and show'r,
Shed no cheerful ray,
Birdie knew "the darkest hour,
Is just before the day;"
Oh, thro' the tree swept the storm,
Seemingly in vain,
For the bird there still just sat
Singing in the rain.

(CHORUS)

3.
Birdie's song to my mind
One true lesson brought
Ne'er to clouds o'er life's path
Give a care or thought;
Even as he sat and trill'd,
Thro' a broken cloud,
Came the sun with brightness filled,
Then birdie carolled loud,
Thus seemingly telling me
We could wisdom gain,
If we'd watch little birds
Singing in the rain.

(CHORUS)
