1.
Soft be the gently breathing notes
That sing the Saviour's dying love;
Soft as the ev'ning zephyr floats,
And soft as tuneful lyres above.

2.
Soft as the morning dews descend,
While warbling birds exulting  soar,
So soft to our almighty Friend
Be ev'ry sigh our bosoms pour.

3.
Pure as the sun's enliv'ning ray,
That scatters life and joy abroad;
Pure as the lucid orb of day,
That wide proclaims its Maker, God.

4.
Pure as the breath of vernal skies,
So pure let our contrition be;
And purely let our sorrows rise
To Him who bled upon the tree.
