1.
Flying, flying,
O'er the heaving main,
O'er the rugged mountain,
And the verdant plain,
Quickly, quickly
To my mother dear
Haste to calm her sorrow
And her heart to cheer.

CHORUS [repeat 2 times (2nd time 'pp') after each verse]
Tell her, tell her, I no more will roam,
Tell her, tell her, I am coming home,
Fly thee, fly thee, happy news away,
Linger not a moment, there is no delay.

2.
Sadly sadly
She for many years
Hath bedewed my mem'ry
With affection's tears;
O how fondly
Doth her hallowed name,
Waken ev'ry feeling
Of delight again.

3.
Lonely, lonely
Is that mother now,
Anxious thoughts oppress her,
Grief is on her brow;
Often, often
Has she thought of me,
When the winds were blowing,
On the stormy sea.

4.
Gladly, gladly
I return once more
To her love so faithful,
And my native shore.
Quickly, quickly
To my mother dear
Haste to calm her sorrow,
And her heart to cheer.
