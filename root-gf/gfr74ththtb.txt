1. Brothers of the plow,
  The power is with you;
The world in expectation waits
  For action prompt and true.
Oppression stalks abroad;
  Monopolies abound;
Their giant hands already clutch
  The tillers of the ground.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Awake! then, awake!
  The great world must be fed,
And Heaven gives the power
  To the _hand that holds the bread_;
Yes! brothers of the plow,
  The people must be fed,
And Heaven gives the power
  To the _H_AND THAT HOLDS THE BREAD.

2. Brothers of the plow!
  In calm and quiet might
You've waited long and patiently
  For what was yours by right;
A fair reward for toil;
  A free and open field;
An honest share for wife and home
  Of what your harvests yield.

3. Brothers of the plow,
  Come, rally once again;
Come, gather from the prairie wide,
  The hillside and the plain;
Not, as in days of yore,
  With trump of battle’s sound,
But come and make the world respect
  The tillers of the ground.
