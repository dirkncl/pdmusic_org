1.
Doubt no more the Savior's power,
But in his strength be brave;
Oh, come, and learn this very hour
That he is able to save.

CHORUS [sung afte each verse]
Able to save,
Able to save,
All who with gladness his word can receive;
Able to save,
Able to save,
E'en to the uttermost, all who believe.

2.
To thy deadly foes within
No longer be the slave,
But stretch thine arms to Christ, thy King,
For he is able to save.

3.
Come, no more thy love withold,
But pardon humbly crave,
And thou shalt find with joy untold
That hs is able to save.
