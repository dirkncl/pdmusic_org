"Music Every-where" (1877)
Words and Music
by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
(from page 25 of "The New Song Era")

1.
Music in the valley,
Music on the hill,
Music in the woodland,
Music in the rill;
Music on the mountain,
Music in the air,
Music in the true heart,
Music everywhere.

2.
Music by the fireside,
Music in the hall,
Music in the school-room,
Music for us all;
Music in our sorrow,
Music in our care,
Music in our gladness,
Music everywhere.

3.
Sing with joyful voices,
Friends and loved ones dear;
Let discord and trouble
Never enter here;
Join the happy chorus
Of all nature fair,
Swell the glorious anthem,
Music everywhere.
