"Break, Break, Break" (1873)
Words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, 1809-1892
Music by George Frederick Root, 1820-1895
from "Waifs & Strays:
A Collection of Beautiful Vocal Gems"

Break, break, break,
On thy cold gray shore, O sea!
Break, break, break,
On thy cold gray shore, O sea!
And I would that my tongue could utter
The thoughts that arise in me,
The thoughts that arise in me.
O well for the fisherman's boy,
That he shouts with his sister at play!
O well for the sailor lad,
That he sings in his boat on the bay!
And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill;
But O for the touch of a vanished hand,
And the sound of a voice that is still!
Break, break, break,
At the foot of thy crags, O sea!
Break, break, break,
At the foot of thy crags, O sea!
But the tender grace of a day that is dead
Will never come back to me;
Will never come back,
Will never come back,
Will never come back to me.
Break, break, break.
