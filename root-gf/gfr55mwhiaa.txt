1.
All alone all alone,
In the silent silent forest shade,
Gloomy night comes apace,
And the lengh'ning shadows quickly fade,
Hark the wind, hark the wind,
Thro' the leafy branches faintly sighs,
And my heart full of care
To its sadly plaintive note replies.

CHORUS [sung twice (2nd time 'pp') after each verse]
Oh how keen the woe, which the heart must know,
If uncheered by friendship's gentle glow;
On the world coldly thrown,
Is the weary wand'rer all alone.

2.
All alone all alone,
As I tread the city's crowded streets,
Not a form, not a form,
Nor a dear familiar face I meet,
Stranger eyes coldly pass
Stranger voices answer to my own,
And I feel in a crowd,
That my weary heart is all alone.

3.
All alone all alone,
When the merry festive hall is bright,
When the young mingle there,
In the mazy dance with gay delight,
Music's call charms me not
All unheeded falls its silv'ry tone,
And I feel even there,
That my weary heart is all alone.
