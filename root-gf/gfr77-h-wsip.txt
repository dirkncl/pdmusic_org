"What Shall It Profit?" (1877)
(Mathew 16:26)
by George Frederick Root

1.
Oh, whosoever will save his life,
His life of self and sin,
Must loose the life of Christ his Lord,
For heav'n he cannot win.

REFRAIN
Oh, what shall it profit a man to gain
The world and lose his soul?
How small the gain--how great the loss,
While endless ages roll!

2.
Oh, whosoever will have his love
Supreme for earthly things,
Must lose that dear redeeming love
With which all heaven rings.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Oh, come, beloved, and turn to Him,
Who this great life can give,
Renounce the life of pride and self,
And thou shalt truly live.

(REFRAIN)
