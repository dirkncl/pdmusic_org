1.
From the temples fair of the better land,
Come the echoes sweet of the angel band;
As they hymn the song of Redeeming love,
In the heavenly choir above, above.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Catch the joyful strain!
Sing it back again,
Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain,
Let the whole world join
In the hallowed song,
As the ages roll along.

2.
In the temples dear of our earthly home,
Where we learn the way to the life to come;
May the echoes sweet from the angel choir,
Every heart with zeal inspire, inspire.

3.
May the voices here that so sweetly blend,
Gladly learn the song that shall never end;
May they join the song of Redeeming love,
With the angel choir above, above.
