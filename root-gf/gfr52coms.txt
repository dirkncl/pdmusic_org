1. Come, O my soul in sacred lays,
Attempt thy great Creator’s praise;
But oh! what tongue can speak his fame?
What mortal verse can reach the theme?

2. Enthroned amid the radiant spheres,
He glory like a garment wears
To form a robe of light divine,
Ten thousand suns around Him shine.

3. In all our Maker’s grand designs,
Omnipotence with wisdom shines;
His works, through all this wondrous frame,
Declare the glory of His name.

4. Raised on Devotion’s lofty wing,
Do thou, my soul, His glories sing;
And let his praise employ thy tongue,
Till listening worlds shall [?] in the song.
