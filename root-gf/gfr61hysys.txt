1.
Have ye sharpen'd your swords
For the war that's begun
And the conflict that's breaking?
As brave as the sire,
So fearless the son
For the banquet of death and the victory won,
While the nation's foundations are shaking,
While the nation's foundations are shaking.

2.
Have ye sharpen'd your swords
For the red carnival?
Have ye thought of the battle field gory,
Where the slain lie in heaps
And death tolls the knell
Of the soul that's departing to heav'n or to hell
While the slaughter rides rampant in glory,
While the slaughter rides rampant in glory,

3.
Have ye sharpen'd your swords,
For your liberties' fight,
While the nation is shouting to battle?
Oh, dread ye the call,
In the first morning light
As it breaks from above thro' the clouds of the night.
Or the sound of the dread musket rattle?
Or the sound of the dread musket rattle?

4.
Have ye sharpen'd your swords,
For the service of God?
Have ye sworn, in your deep desolation,
The blood of the traitor
Shall water the sod,
Over which to the battle our forefathers trod,
When they gave to the world a new nation?
When they gave to the world a new nation?
