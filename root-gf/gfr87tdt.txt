1. Fair as the morning, bright as the day, 
Vision of beauty, fade not away, 
Over the mountain, over the sea, 
Come in sweet dreams to me. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Far and wide the echoes roll along, 
While the day world sings its busy song; 
But what are all its labors to me, 
Under the Dreamland tree. 

2. Angel of slumber, bright as the day, 
Vision of beauty, tarry for aye; 
Chase from my spirit shadows of care, 
Leave but thy presence there.
