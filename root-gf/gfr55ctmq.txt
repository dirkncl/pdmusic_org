The above dispatch recently sent from
the South, forms the Title and Subject of the accom-
panying song.

1.
Come to me quickly! lov'd ones dear,
In a distant land I'm dying;
Sweetly the vision my heart would cheer
The heart that for you is sighing.
O, how I long to behold once more,
Those who have lov'd me in days of yore,
Trembling I stand on this mortal shore,--
Come, O, come!
Come e'er my life is o'er.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Quickly they sped to the lov'd and lone,
But the gentle sould had gone.

2.
Come to me quckly! do not stay;
For I wait this last fond meeting;
Angels are calling my soul away,
And faintly each pulse is beating.
Shall I not look on you all once more?
You who have love'd me in days of yore,
Soon to its home will my spirit soar,--
Come, O, come!
Come e'er my life is o'er.
