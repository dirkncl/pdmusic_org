1.
Oh, drink at the fountain of truth divine,
And into our hearts let the sunlight shine,
That we in the light of the Word may behold
The beautiful city with streets of gold.

[CHORUS 1]
The beautiful city, (The beautiful city,)
The beautiful city with streets of gold.

2.
The beautiful city of truth and love,
Descending to earth from the heav'ns above,
Arrayed in the clear shining garments of light,
Dispelling the gloom of the dismal night.

[CHORUS 2]
The beautiful city, (The beautiful city,)
The beautiful city where is no light.

3.
Let love for the service of Christ be pure,
Built on the foundations that aye endure,
For ev'ry true heart for His glory that beats,
Shall live in the city with golden streets.

[CHORUS 3]
The beautiful city, (The beautiful city,)
The beautiful city with golden streets.
