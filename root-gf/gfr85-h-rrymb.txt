1. 
Ring, ring, ye merry bells,
Ring your Christmas story;
“Peace on earth, goodwill to men,”
Give to Christ the glory.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ring it out from steeples high,
Send your message to the sky;
“Peace on earth, goodwill to men,”
Ring it once again.

2. 
Ring, ring, ye Christmas bells,
Ring a kindly greeting
To all men, for on this day,
Hands and hearts are meeting.

3. 
Glad be the Christmas songs,
Which our hearts are singing;
Keeping time to merry bells,
From the tower ringing.
