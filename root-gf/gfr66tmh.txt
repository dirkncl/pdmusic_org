"The Mason's Home" (1866)
Words by Robert Morris L.L.D.
Music by George Frederic Root

1.
Where hearts are warm with kindred fire,
And love beams free from answ'ring eyes,
Bright spirits hover always there;
And that's the home that mason's prize.

CHORUS 1
The mason's home,
The peaceful home,
The home of light and love and joy!
How gladly does the mason come
To share his tender, sweet employ.

2.
A weary tank, a dreary round,
Is all benighted man can know,
But here a brighter scene is found,
The brightest scene that's found below.

CHORUS 2
The mason's home,
The happy home,
The home of light, and love, and joy!
There's not an hour that I would come,
And share this tender sweet employ.

3.
All round the world be land, by sea,
Where summers burn, or winters chill,
The exil'd mason turns to thee;
And yearns to share the joys we feel.

CHORUS 3
The mason's home,
The blissful home,
Glad centre of unmingled joy!
Long as I live I'll gladly come;
And share his tender, sweet employ.

4.
And when the hour of death shall come,
And darkness seal my closing eye,
May hands fraternal bear me home;
The home where weary masons lie.

CHORUS 4
The mason's home,
The heav'nly home,
To faithful hearts eternal joy!
How next to find beyond the tomb,
The end of all our sweet employ.
