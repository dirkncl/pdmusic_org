1. 
Oh, how glad to get home! 
For far I’ve wandered, 
Joyful joyful I come, 
Dear home, to thee! 
Fond ones welcome me here; 
Loved ones are near me; 
Voices float on my ear, 
Sweet, sweet to me. 

REFRAIN [repeat after each verse]
Dear friends that are round me, 
Haste with looks delighted, 
Days long vanished and gone, 
Come to my heart. 

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Dear home of my childhood, 
Once again united, 
Never, never again 
From thee I part. 
Dear home of my childhood, 
Once again united, 
Never, never again 
From thee I part.

2. 
Father, in the warm grasp 
I feel thy welcome, 
Oh, from love’s tender clasp 
Ne’er let me fly. 
Mother, fondly again 
Thou dost enfold me; 
Tears I cannot restrain 
Burst from mine eye; 

3. 
Brother, still is thy brow 
Noble as ever, 
As I look on thee now, 
How swells my heart! 
Sister, gentle and kind 
Close to me clinging; 
Now in love we are twined, 
No more to part.
