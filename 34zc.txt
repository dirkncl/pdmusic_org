1.
O ole Zip Coon he is a larned skoler,
O ole Zip Coon he is a larned skolar,
O ole Zip Coon he is a larned skolar,
Sings posom up a gum tree an cooney in a holler,
posom up a gum tree, cooney on a stump,
posum up a gum tree, cooney on a stump,
posum up a gum tree, cooney on a stump,
Den over dubble trubble, Zip Coon will jump.

CHORUS
O Zip a duden duden duden zip a duden day.
O Zip a duden duden duden duden duden day.
O Zip a duden duden duden duden duden day.
Zip a duden duded duden zip a duden day.

2.
O its old Suky blue skin, she is in lub wid me
I went the udder arter noon to take a dish ob tea;
What do you tink now, Suky hab for supper,
Why chicken foot an posum heel, without any butter.

(CHORUS)

3.
Did you eber see the wild goose, sailing on de ocean,
O de wild goose motion is a berry pretty notion;
Ebry time de wild goose, beckons to de swaller,
You hear him google google google google gollar.

(CHORUS)

4.
I went down to Sandy Hollar tother arternoon
And the first man I chanced to meet war ole Zip Coon;
Ole Zip Coon he is a natty scholar,
For he plays upon de Banjo "Cooney in de hollar."

(CHORUS)

5.
My old Missus she's mad wid me,
Kase I wouldn't go wid her into Tennessee
Massa build him barn and put in de fodder
Twas dis ting and dat ting on ting or odder.

(CHORUS)

6.
I pose you heard ob de battle New Orleans,
Whar ole Gineral Jackson gib de British beans;
Dare de Yankee boys ob de job so slick,
For dey cotch old Packenham an rowed him up de creek.

(CHORUS)

7.
I hab many tings to tork about but just dont know wich come first,
So here de toast to ole Zip Coon before he gin to rust;
May he hab de pretty girls, like de King ob ole,
To sing dis song so many times, 'fore he turn to mole.

(CHORUS)
