[With various repititions and overlapping voices]
Here's a health to all good lasses,
Pledge it merrily, fill your glasses
Let a bumper toast go round.

May they live a life of pleasure,
Without mixture, without measure,
For with them true joys are found.

All good lasses
Here's a bumper.

Here's a health to all good lasses,
Pledge it merrily, fill your glasses
Let a bumper toast go round.
