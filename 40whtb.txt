1. Come all you brisk young fellows, who have a mind to roam 
Unto some foreign country, a long way from home, 
Unto some foreign country along with me to go, 
And we’ll settle on the banks of the lovely Ohio.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sweet and shady groves! 
Thro’ the wild woods we’ll wander, 
and we’ll hunt the Buffalo, 
And we’ll hunt the Buffalo, 
Thro’ the wild woods we’ll wander, 
and we’ll hunt the Buffalo.

2. Come all ye pretty fair maids, and spin us some yarn 
To make us some nice clothing, to keep ourselves warm;
For you can knit and sew, my loves, while we do reap and mow,
When we settle on the banks of the lovely Ohio.

3. There are fishes in the river just fitted for our use;
There’s tall and lofty sugarcan that yields us some juice;
There is all kind of game, my boys, beside the buck and doe, 
When we settle on the banks of the lovely Ohio.

4.. If ever those wild Indians do unto us come nigh, 
We will all unite, together, lads, to conquer or to die;
We will  march into their tents, boys, and strike the deadly blow,
When we settle on the banks of the lovely Ohio.
