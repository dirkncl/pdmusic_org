1. King Alcohol has many forms
  By which he catches men.
He is a beast of many horns
  And ever thus has been.

[REFRAIN 1-­2] 
For there’s rum and gin, and beer, and wine
And brandy of logwood hue
And hock, and port, and flip combine
To make a man look blue.
He says be merry, for here’s good sherry
And Tom and Jerry, Champagne and Perry,
And spirits of every hue,
O are not these a fiendish crew
As ever a mortal knew?
O are not these a fiendish crew
As ever a mortal knew?

2. King Alcohol is very sly,
  A liar from the first.
He’ll make you drink until you’re dry
  Then drink, because you thirst.

3. King Alcohol has had his day.
  His kingdom’s crumbling fast.
His votaries are heard to say
  “Our tumbling days are past.”

[REFRAIN 3-­4]
For there’s no rum, nor gin, nor beer, nor wine,
  Nor brandy of any hue,
Nor hock, nor port, nor flip combined
  To make a man get blue.
And now they’re merry, without their sherry,
Or Tom and Jerry, Champagne and Perry
  Or spirits of every hue.
And now they are a temp’rate crew
  As ever a mortal knew.
And now they are a temp’rate crew
  And have given the devil his due.

4. The shout of Washingtonians
  Is heard on every gale.
They’re chanting now the victory
  O’er cider, beer, and ale.
