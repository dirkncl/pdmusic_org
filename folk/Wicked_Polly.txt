"Wicked Polly"
Traditional American Folksong

1.
Young people, who delight in sin,
I'll tell you what has lately been;
A woman who was young and fair,
Died in sin and deep despair.

2.
She went to frolics, dance and play,
In spite of all her friends could say--
'I'll turn to God when I get old,
And He will then receive my soul.'

3.
On Friday morning she took sick,
Her stubborn heart began to break,
She called her mother to her bed,
Her eyes were rolling in her head.

4.
'O mother, mother, fare you well,
Your wicked Polly's doomed to Hell,
The tears are lost you shed for me,
My soul is lost I plainly see.

5.
'My earthly father, fare you well,
Your wicked Polly's doomed to Hell,
The flaming wrath begins to roll,
I am a lost and ruined soul.'

6.
She gnawed her tongue before she died,
She rolled, she growled, she screamed and cried,
'O must I burn for evermore
Till thousand, thousand years are o'er?'

7.
Young people, lest this be your case,
O turn to God and trust His grace,
Down on your knees for mercies cry,
Lest you in sin, like Polly, die.
