1.
In Scarlett towne, where I was borne,
  There was a faire maid dwellin',
Made ev'ry youth crye Well-a-waye,
  Her name was Barb'ra Allen.

2.
All in the merrye month of May,
  When greenbuds they were swellin',
Young Jemmye Grove on his death bed lay,
  For love of Barb'ra Allen.

3.
He sent his man unto her then,
  To the town where shee was dwellin';
You must come to my master deare,
  Giff your name be Barb'ra Allen.

4.
For death is printed on his face,
  And ore his his harte is stealin';
Then haste away to comfort him
  O lovely Barb'ra Allen.

5.
Tho' death be printed on his face,
  And ore his harte is stealing,
Yet little better shall he bee
  For a bonny Barb'ra Allen.

6.
So slowly, slowly, she came up,
  And slowly she came nye him;
And all she say'd when there she came,
  Young man, I think y'are dying.

7.
He turn'd his face unto her strait,
  With deadly sorrow sighing;
O lovely maid, come pity mee,
  I'me on my deathbed lying.

8.
If on your deathbed you doe lye,
  What mreds the tale you're telling;
I cannot keep you from your death;
  Farewell said Barb'ra Allen.

9.
He turned his face unto the wall
  As deadlye pangs he fell in;
Adieu, adieu, adieu to all,
  Adiew to Barbara Allen.

10.
As she was walking oer the fields
  She heard the bell a knellin';
And every stroke did seem to saye,
Unworthy Barbara Allen.

11.
She turned her bodye round about
  And spied the corps a coming;
Laye down, laye down the corps she sayd,
  That I may look upon him.

12.
With scornful eye she looked downe
  Her cheeks with laughter swelling;
Whilst all her friends cried out amaine,
  Unworthy Barbary Allen.

13.
When he was dead, and laid in grave,
  Her harte was struck with sorrow,
O mother, mother, make my bed,
  For I shall dye tomorrowe.

14.
Hard-harted creature him to slight,
  Who loved me so dearlye;
O that I had been more kind to him
  When he was alive and neare me.

15.
She, on her death bed as she laye,
  Beg'd to be buried by him;
And sore repented of the daye,
  That she did ore denye him!

16.
Farewell, she sayd, ye virgina all,
  And sheu that fault I fell in;
Henceforth take warning by the fall
  Of cruel Barbara Allen.

===================================
1.
In Scotland I was born and bred,
In Scotland I was dwelling,
When a young man on his death bed lay
For the sake of Barb'ra Ellen.

2.
He sent his servant to her house
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying: You must come to my master's house,
If you name is Barb'ra Ellen.

3.
So slowly she put on her clothes,
So slowly she came to him,
And when she came to his bedside,
She said: Young man, you're dying.

4.
A dying man! O don't say so,
For one kiss from you will cure me.
One kiss from me you never shall have
While your poor heart is breaking.

5.
If you look up at my bedhead
You will see my watch a-hanging'
Here's my gold ring and my gold chain
I give to Barb'ra Ellen.

6.
If you look down at my bed's-foot
You will see a bowl a-standing,
And in it is the blood I've shed
For the sake of Barb'ra Ellen.

7.
As I was walking down the fields,
I heard some birds a-singing;
And as they sang they seem'd to say:
Hard hearted Barb'ra Ellen.

8.
As I was walking down the lane,
I heard some bells a-tolling;
And as they toll'd they seem'd to say:
Hard hearted Barb'ra Ellen.

9.
As I was walking up the groves
And met his corps a-coming;
Stay, stay, said she, and stop awhile,
That I may gaze all on you.

10.
The more she gazed, the more she smiled,
Till she burst out a-laughing;
And her parents cried out: Fie, for shame,
Hard hearted Barb'ra Ellen.

11.
Come, mother, come, make up my bed,
Make it both long and narrow;
My true love died for me yesterday,
I'll die for him tomorrow.

12.
And he was buried in Edmonstone,
And she was buried in Cold Harbour;
And out of him sprang roses red,
And out of her sweet briar.

13.
It grew and grew so very high
Till it could grow no higher;
And around the top growed a true lover's knot
And around it twined sweet-briar.
