"Shenandoah"
American Riverboat Chantey

1.
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
Away, you rolling river!
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
Away, I'm bound away,
'Cross the wide Missouri.

2.
The white mand loved an Indian maiden,
Away, you rolling river!
With notions his canoe was laden,
Away, I'm bound away,
'Cross the wide Missouri.

3.
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter,
Away, you rolling river!
For her I've crossed the stormy water,
Away, I'm bound away,
'Cross the wide Missouri.

4.
Farewell, my dear, I'm bound to leave you,
Away, you rolling river!
Oh, Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you,
Away, I'm bound away!
'Cross the wide Missouri.
