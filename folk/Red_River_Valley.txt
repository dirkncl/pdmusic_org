"Red River Valley"
Traditional Cowboy Song
[based on "In the Bright Mohawk Valley"
of the 1890s]

1.
From this valley they say you are going:
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile,
For they say you are taking the sunshine,
Which has brightened our pathway awhile.

CHORUS
Come and sit by my side if you love me,
Do not hasten to bid me adieu,
But remember the Red River Valley
And the girl that has loved you so true.

2.
Won't you think of the valley you're leaving?
Oh how lonely, how sad it will be,
Oh think of the fond heart you're breaking,
And the grief you are causing me.

(CHORUS)

3.
I have promised you, darling, that never
Will a word from my lips cause you pain;
And my life, will be yours forever
If you only will love me again.

(CHORUS)
