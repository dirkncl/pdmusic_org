1. But black is the color of my true love's hair,
Her cheeks are like some rosy fair,
The prettiest eyes and tbe neatest hands,
I love the ground whereon she stands.

2. I love my love and well she knows,
I love the ground whereon she goes,
If you now more on earth I see,
I won't serve you as you have me.

3. The winter's past and the leaves are green,
The time is passed that we have seen,
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I shall be as one.

4. I go to the Clyde for to mourn and weep,
But satisfied I never could sleep,
I'll write you a letter in a few short lines,
I'll suffer death ten thousand times.

5. So farte you well, my own true love,
The time has passed, but I wish you well,
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I shall be as one.

6. I love my love and well she knows,
I love the ground whereon she goes,
The prettiest eyes and tbe neatest hands,
I love the ground whereon she stands.
