Traditional folksong from Bengal (East India)

Selected and arranged by Peter Gritton]

Jahoori jahoor re chenei katooriai katt.
Rakhalia krishak a chenei fasholeri maat.
Sharno karei shona chenei kasharura kasha,
shati nari janei shudhu patir bhalobasha.
Aami konu kisu chinlam narei, kulkinara
pailam na pabashastra bujhlam na.

[English translation]
Jewellers, they know their jewels,
woodcutters know their wood.
Farmers know their field of barley
and their field of corn.
Goldsmiths know their golden bracelets,
silversmiths their silver,
The good woman only knows
the love of her husband.
But I have little understanding,
I don't know which way to go,
I don't know the way of life.
