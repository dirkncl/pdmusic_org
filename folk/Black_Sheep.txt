in the English Language" by Alan Lomax]

1. Black sheep, black sheep,
Where’d you leave your lamb?
Way down in the valley.

2. Bees and the butterflies
A pickin’ out his eyes,
Poor little thing cryin’ “Mammy!”

3. Black sheep, black sheep,
Where’d you leave your lamb?
Way down in the valley. 

4. My mother told me
Before she went away
To take good care of the baby,
But I went out to play
And the baby ran away,
And the poor little thing cryin’ “Mammy“.
