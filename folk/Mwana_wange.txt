"Mwana wange" [Sleep now my child]
Tradition folksong lullaby

[English translation]
Sleep now my child, rest your weary head.
Sleep now my child, rest your weary head.

Sunlight is gone, darkness is here again.

Rest while your poor father works on.
Rest while your poor father works on.

Back, the herds, resting in their pens.
Sleep now my dear child,
all the hurts of today are gone.
Sleep and dream of all that you love,
sleep and dream in happiness,
smile upon your kind mother's face,
sleep my child in peace.
