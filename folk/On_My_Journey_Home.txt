"On My Journey Home"
Traditional Folksong

1.
When I can read my title clear
To mansions in the skies,
I'll bid farewell to every fear
And wipe my weeping eyes.

CHORUS
I feel like, I feel like
I'm on my journey home.
I feel like, I feel like
I'm on my journey home.

2.
Should earth against my sould engage
And hellish darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Satan's rage
And face a frowning world.

(CHORUS)

3.
Let cares like wild deluge come
And storms of sorrow fall;
May I but safely reach my home,
My God, my heaven, my all.
