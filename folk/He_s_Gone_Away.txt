"He's Gone Away"
(Traditional Folksong)

I'm goin' away for to stay a little while,
But I'm comin' back if I go ten thousand miles.
Oh, who will tie your shoes?
And who will glove you hands?
And who will kiss your ruby lips when I am gone?

Oh, it's papy'll tie my shoes,
And mamy'll glove my hands,
And you will kiss my ruby red lips when you come back!

Oh, he's gone, he's gone away,
For to stay a little while;
But he's comin' back if he goes ten thousand miles.

Look away, look away, look away over Yandro,
On Yandro's high hill, where them white doves are flyin'
From bough to bough and a-matin' with their mates,
So why not me with mine?

For he's gone, oh, he's gone away
For to stay a little while,
But he's comin' back if he goes ten thousand miles.

I'll go build me a desrick on Yandro's high hill,
Where the wild beasts won't bother me nor hear me cry;
For he's gone, he's gone away for to stay a little while,
But he's comin' back if he goes ten thousand miles.
