"Springtime Blossom"
Traditional Bulgarian Folksong

1.
Springtime blossom beautifies the bowers,
Fair Irina gathers pretty flowers,

CHORUS 2-times
Cherry blossom, honeysuckle clover,
All their perfumes rivalling each other.

2.
Fair Irina, with her flowing tresses,
Gathers flowers while the wind caresses.

CHORUS 2-times
"Dearest Mitko, your true love awaits you;
Come back Mitko, let my arms embrace you.

3.
"Where, I wonder is my love roaming?
Why, I wonder, is no letter coming?

CHORUS 2-times
Spring is lover's time, season of sweet passion;
Yet my maiden days are quickly passing."

4.
Springtime blossom beautifies the bowers,
Fair Irina gathers pretty flowers;

CHORUS 2-times
Gathers flowers, bitterly lamenting;
Budding branches in the breeze are bending.

5.
From the branches swoopes a swallow, saying;
"I shall show you where your love is staying."

CHORUS 2-times
Off the bird flies and she follows after;
"Lead me," she cries, "lead me to him faster."

6.
Here they buried him, where the weeds grow thickly,
And an eagle guards his grave in pity,

CHORUS 2-times
With his body warding off the weather,
Thus the eagle mourns the fallen rebel.
