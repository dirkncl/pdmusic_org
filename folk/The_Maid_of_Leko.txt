"The Maid of Leko"
Traditional German Folksong

1.
There lived a maiden long ago,
Blue-eyed, fair as day:
Upon the isle of Hestmando
Lived this fair maid.
And it is said
All hearts owed her sway.

2.
There came a rider, proud and bold;
To the maid did he plead,
Yet to his wooing she was cold.
Coarsely he played
To the fair maid,
Riding on his steed.

3.
The maiden knew how sad her plight,
Helpless and alone;
She prayed to heav'n to aid her flight,
And in their coarse
Rider and horse
Turned to solid stone.

4.
And still the mounted horseman stands
Upon Leko Hill,
And people from Norwegian lands
Bow as they pass,
Seeing -- alas! --
How rash love works ill.
