1. Iｴm just a poor wayfaring stranger,
Atrav値ing through this world of woe;
But there痴 no sickness, toil or danger
In that fair land to which I go.
I知 going there to see my father,
I知 going there no more to roam;
I知 just agoing over Jordan,
I知 just agoing over home.

2. I know dark clouds will gather 池ound me,
I know my way is rough and steep;
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me,
Where God痴 redeemed their vigils keep.
I知 going there to meet my mother,
She said she壇 meet me when I come;
I知 only going over Jordan,
I知 only going over home.

3. I値l soon be freed from every trial,
My body asleep in the churchyard;
I値l drop the cross of selfdenial,
And enter on my great reward.
I知 going there to see my brothers,
Who致e gone before me one by one;
I知 only going over Jordan,
I知 only going over home.

4. I want to wear a crown of glory,
When I get home to that good land;
I want to shout salvation痴 story,
In concert with the bloodwashed band.
I知 going there to see my Savior,
To sing His praise forever more;
I知 only going over Jordan,
I知 only going over home.
