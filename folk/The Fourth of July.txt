1. From dawn of day to set of sun
July the Fourth is full of fun;
O happy summer holiday,
When banners wave and children play!
The birthday of our own dear land,
Beneath whose starry flag we stand.

2. A birthday present ev’ry year
We ought to give our country dear;
O happy summer holiday,
When banners wave and children play!
So now, dear land, I give to you
My heart’s love ever warm and true.
