1. What clatters on the roof,
With quick impatient hoofs?
I think it must be Santa Claus!
Hark Old Santa Claus,
He’s in his loaded sledge.

2. I wonder what he brings,
What heaps of pretty thingd,
And how he gets them doewn the flue.
Hark! Down thru’ the fllue
Just where the stockings hang?

3. ’Tis cold as cold can be,
Yes I should like to see
If Santa Claus is dressed his best,
Hark! Dressed for his ride,
His ride around the world.

4. I guess I’ll dare to peep,
He’ll think me sound asleep;
Why, there he is with heaps of toys;
Hark, Yes, heaps of toys;
Yes, there is Santa Claus!
