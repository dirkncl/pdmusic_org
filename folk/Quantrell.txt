"Quantrell"
Traditional American Folk Song

1.
Come all ye bold robbers and open your ears,
Of Quantrell the lion-heart you quickly shall hear,
With his band of bold raiders in double-quick time
They came to burn Lawrence just over the line.

CHORUS
All routing and shouting and giving the yell,
Like so many demons just raised up from Hell,
The boys they were drunken with powder and wine,
And came to burn Lawrence just over the line.

2.
They came to burn Lawrence, they came not to stay,
They rode in one morning at breaking of day,
Their guns were a-waving and horses a-foam,
And Quantrell a-riding his famous big roan.

(CHORUS)

3.
The came to burn Lawrence, they came not to stay.
Jim Lane he was up at the break of the day;
He saw them a-coming and got in a fright,
Then crawled in a corncrib to get out of sight.

(CHORUS)

4.
Oh, Quantrell's a fighter, a bold-hearted boy,
A brave man or woman he'll never annoy,
He'd take from the wealthy and give to the poor,
For brave men there's never a bolt to his door.

(CHORUS)
