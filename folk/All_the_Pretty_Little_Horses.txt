"All the Pretty Little Horses"
Traditional American Folksong

REFRAIN
Hushaby,
Don't you cry,
Go to sleepy, little baby.

1.
When you wake,
You shall have
All the pretty little horses---
Blacks and bays,
Dapples and grays,
Coach and six-a little horses.

2.
Way down yonder,
In de medder
There's a po' lil lambie,
De bees an' de' butterflies
Peckin' out its eyes,
De po' lil thing cried, "Mammy!"

(REFRAIN)
