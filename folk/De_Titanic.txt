1. 
De rich folks 'cided to take a trip 
On de fines' ship dat was ever built. 
De cap'n persuaded dese peoples to think 
Dis Titanic too safe to sink. 

CHORUS 
Out on dat ocean, 
De great wide ocean, 
De Titanic, out on de ocean, 
Sinkin' down! 

2. 
De ship lef' de harbor at a rapid speed, 
'Twas carryin' everythin' dat de peoples need. 
She sailed six-hundred miles away, 
Met an icebug in her way. 

(CHORUS) 

3. 
De ship lef' de harbor, 'twuz runnin' fas'.
'Twuz her fus' trip an' her las'. 
Way out on dat ocean wide 
An icebug ripped her in de side.

Up come Bill from de bottom flo' 
Said de water wuz runnin' in de boiler do'. 
Go back, Bill, an' shut yo' mouth, 
Got forty-eight pumps to keep de water out!

He give orders to de mens aroun': 
"Get yo' life-boats an' let 'em down!"

While de band played "Nearer My God to Thee!"
