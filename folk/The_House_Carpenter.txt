"The House Carpenter"
Traditional American Folksong

1.
'Well met, well met, you old true love.'
'Well met, well met,' said she.
'I have just returned from the sea-shore sea,
From the land where the grass grows green.

2.
'Well, I could have married a king's daughter there,
And she would have married me,
But I refused the golden crown
And all for the sake of thee.'

3.
'If you could have married a king's daughter there,
I'm sure you are to blame;
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I think he's a nice young man.'

4.
'If you'll forsake your house carpenter
And come and go with me,
I'll take you where the grass grows green,
To the lands on the banks of the sea.'

5.
She went an' picked up her sweet little babe,
And kissed it, one, two, three,
Sayin', 'Stay at home with your father dear
And keep him good company.'

6.
She went and dressed in her very best,
As everyone can see;
She glittered and glistened and proudly she walked
The streets on the banks of the sea.

7.
They hadn't been sailing but about three weeks,
I'm sure it was not four,
Til this young lady began to weep,
And her weeping never ceased any more.

8.
'Are you coming for your house carpenter?
Are you mournin' for your store?'
'No, I'm mournin' for my sweet little babe
That I never will see any more.'

9.
They hadn't been sitting but about four weeks,
An' sure it was not more,
Till the ship sprang a leak from the bottom of the sea
And it sank to rise no more.
