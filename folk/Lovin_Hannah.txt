"Lovin' Hannah"
(traditional folk song)

Verse 1
I rode to church last Sunday,
My true love passed me by.
I knew her love was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye.

Refrain 1
By the rovin' of her eye,
By the rovin' of her eye,
I knew her love was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye.

Verse 2
My love is fair and proper
Her hands are neat and small.
And she is quite good lookin'
And that's the best of all,

Refrain 2
And that's the best of all,
And that's the best of all,
And she is quite good lookin'
And that's the best of all.

Verse 3
O Hannah, lovin' Hannah,
Come, give to me your hand,
You said if you ever married,
That I should be the man,

Refrain 3
That I should be the man,
That I should be the man,
You said if you ever married,
That I should be the man.

Verse 4
I'll go down by the waters
When everyone's asleep,
I'll think on lovin' Hannah,
And then set down an' weep,

Refrain 4
And then set down an' weep,
And then set down an' weep,
I'll think on lovin' Hannah,
And then set down an' weep.
