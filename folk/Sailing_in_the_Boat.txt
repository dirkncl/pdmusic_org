1.
Sailing in the boat when the tide runs high,
Sailing in the boat when the tide runs high,
Sailing in the boat when the tide runs high,
Waiting for the pretty girl to come by'm by.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Here she comes, so fresh and fair,
Sky-blue eyes and curly hair,
Rosy in cheek, dimple in her chin,
Say, young man, but you can't come in.

2.
Rose in the garden for you young, man,
Rose in the garden for you young, man,
Rose in the garden, get it if you can,
But take care not a frost-bitten one.

3.
Choose your partner, stay till day,
Choose your partner, stay till day,
Choose your partner, stay till day,
And don't never mind what the old folks say!

4.
Old folks say 'tis the very best way,
Old folks say 'tis the very best way,
Old folks say 'tis the very best way,
To court all night and sleep all day.
