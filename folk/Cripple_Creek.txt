"Cripple Creek"
Appalachian Folk Song
[Source: melody, lyrics and chords from p. 232 (#118)
from "The Folk Songs of North American 
(in the English Language)" by Alan Lomax.]

1. 
I got a gal at the head of the creek, 
Go up to see her ’bout the middle of the week, 
Kiss her on the mouth, just as sweet as any wine, 
Wraps herself around me like a sweet pertater vine.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Goin’ up Cripple Creek, goin’ in a run, 
Goin’ up Cripple Creek to have a little fun. 
Goin’ up Cripple Creek, goin’ in a whirl, 
Goin’ up Cripple Creek to see my girl.

2. 
Girls on the Cripple Creek ’bout half grown, 
Jump on a boy like a dog on a bone. 
Roll my britches up to my knees, 
I’ll wade old Cripple Creek when I please.

3. 
Cripple Creek’s wide and Cripple Creek’s deep, 
I’ll wade old Cripple Creek before I sleep. 
Roads are rocky and the hillside’s muddy 
And I’m so drunk that I can’t stand study.*

[* = steady]
