"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier"
Traditional Folksong

1.
O Johnny dear has gone away,
He has gone afar across the bay,
O my heart is sad and weary today,
Johnny has gone for a soldier.

CHORUS
Shule, shule, shule agrah,
Time can only heal my woe,
Since the lad of my heart from me did go,
O Johnny has gone for a soldier.

2.
I'll dye my dress I'll dye it red,
And through the streets I'll beg my bread,
And through the streets I'll beg my bread,
Johnny has gone for a soldier.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'll sell my clock, I'll sell my reel,
I'll sell my flax and spinning wheel,
To buy my true love sword of steel,
Johnny has gone for a soldier.

(CHORUS)

4.
Me, O my, I love him so,
Broke my heart to see him go,
Only time can heal my woe,
Johnny has gone for a soldier.

(CHORUS)
