"John Barleycorn" (English folksong)
Words and Music: anonymous

1.
There were three kings came from the west, 
Their victory to try; 
And they have taken a solemn oath, 
John Barleycorn should die. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-ge-wo. 

2.
They took a plough and plough’d him in, 
Laid clods upon his head; 
And they have taken a solemn oath, 
John Barleycorn is dead. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-ge-wo.

3.
So there he lay for a full fortnight, 
Till the dew on him did fall: 
Then Barleycorn sprang up again, 
And that surprised them all. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-ge-wo. 

4.
There he remain’d till midsummer, 
And look’d both pale and wan; 
Then Barleycorn be got a beard, 
And so became a man. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-ge-wo. 

5.
Then they sent men with scythes so sharp, 
To cut him off at knee; 
And then poor Johnny Barleycorn, 
They served him barb’rously. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-gewo. 

6.
O, Barleycorn, in the choicest grain 
That o’er was sown on land; 
It wil do more than any grain, 
By the turning of your hand. 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay, 
  Fol the dol the did-i-ay-ge-wo.
