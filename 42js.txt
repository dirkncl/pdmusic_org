1. A man whose name is Johnny Sands, 
Had married Betty Hague, 
And though she brought him gold and lands, 
She prov’d a terrible plague, 
For Oh! she was a scolding wife, 
Full of caprice and whim. 
He said, that he was tired of life, 
And she was tired of him. 
And she was tired of him, 
And she was tired of him. 
Says he “then I will drown myself— 
The river runs below,” 
Says she, “pray do you silly elf 
I wished it long ago,” 
Says he, “upon the brink I’ll stand, 
Do you run down the hill, 
And push me in with all your might,” 
Says  she my love I will,” 
Says she “my love I will,” 
Says she “my love I will.”

2. “For fear that I should courage lack 
And try to save my life, 
Pray tie my hands behind my back,” 
“I will” replied my wife. 
She tied them fast as you may think, 
And when securely done, 
“Now stand” she says “upon the brink 
And I’ll prepare to run, 
And I’ll prepare to run, 
And I’ll prepare to run,” 
All down the hill his loving bride 
Now ran with all her force 
To push him in he stepped out aside, 
And she fell in of course 
Now splashing, dashing like a fish, 
“Oh save me Johnny Sands” 
“I can’t my dear tho’ much I wish, 
For you have tied my hands, 
For you have tied my hands, 
For you have tied my hands.”
