1. My boat’s by the tow’r, my barque’s in the bay, 
And both must be gone ere the dawning of dayl 
The moon’s in her shroud, but to guide thee afar, 
On the deck of the daring’s a love lighted star. 
Then wake lady wake. I am waiting for thee. 
And this night or never my bride thou shall be. 
  Then wake, lady wake, I am waiting for thee. 
  And this night or never my bride thou shalt be.

2. Forgive my rough mood, unaccustom’d to one, 
I woo not perhaps as your land lovers woo, 
My voice has been tuned to the notes of the gun. 
That startle the deep when the combat’s begun, 
And heavy and hard is the grasp of the hand, 
Whose glove has be ever the guard of our band. 
  Then wake, lady wake, I am waiting for thee. 
  And this night or never my bride thou shalt be.

3. Oh! Islands there are on the face of the deep,
Where the leaves never change, and the skies never weep,
And there if thou wilt, our love bower shall be,
When we leave for the greenwood our home on the sea.
And there thou shalt sing of the deeds that were done,
When we loos’d the last blast and the last battle won.
  Then wake, lady wake, I am waiting for thee. 
  And this night or never my bride thou shalt be.

4. Oh! haste, lady haste, for the fair breezes blow,
And my ocean bird poises her pinions of snow;
Now fast to the lattice these silken cords twine.
They are meet for such feet and such fingers as thine!
The signal my mates— ho! hurrah! for the sea.
This night and forever my bride thou shaltbe.
  The signal my mates— ho! hurrah! for the sea.
  This night and forever my bride thou shaltbe.
