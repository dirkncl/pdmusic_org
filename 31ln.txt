1. Love not! love not! ye hapless sons of clay. 
Hope’s gayest wreaths are made of earthly flowers; 
Things that are made to fade and fall away 
||:Ere they have blossom’d for a few short hours.:|| 
  Love not! Love not! Oh Love not!

2. Love not! Love not! the thing you love may die,
May perish from the gay and gladsome earth;
The silent stars, the blue and smiling sky,
||:Beam on its grave, as once upon its birth.:||
  Love not! Love not! Oh Love not!

3. Love not! Love not! the thing you love my change,
The rosy lip, may cease to smile on you;
The kindly beaming eye grow cold and strange,
||:The heart still warmly beat, yet not be true.:||
  Love not! Love not! Oh Love not!

4. Love not! Love not! oh warning vainly said,
In present hours, as in years gone by;
Love flings a halo, round the dear ones head,
||:Faultless, immortal, till they change or die.:||
  Love not! Love not! Oh Love not!
