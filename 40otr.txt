1.
Way down in North Carolina
On de banks of Ole Tare River,
I go from dar to Alabama
For to see my ole Aunt Hannah,

2.
Raccoon and possum got in a fray
Fought all night untill de next day
When de day broke de Pos cut to de hollow
Old Coon says I guess I better follow.

3.
De met next on de top ob de hill
For to settle dis great diffikil
Possum seized de Coon by de tail
Make him wish he was on a rail.

4.
Ole nigger cum along wid his dog
Possom cut for de hollow log
Coon he looked and saw sat nig
So up da tree he den did dig.

5.
De ale dog watch, smelt all around
He found the Coon jest lef de ground
Den he bark rite up de tree
De ole Coon says you cant ketch me.

6.
De ole dog bark, de nigger blow his horn
Old Coon begin to tink he was gone
Ole nigger com he cast up his eye
On a big limb dat coon did lie.

7.
Nigger went to work and cut de tree down
De ole Coon he could not be found
De Coon cut stick he was afraid ob de dog
He run slep in another hollow log.

8.
De Pos says Coon get out ob dis log
Lay rite still for I believe I hear de dog
De nigger den cum and stopt up de hole
And day couldn't get out to save dar souls.

9.
Now Miss Dinah I'm going to leave you
And whem I'm gone dont let it grieve you
First to the window den to de door
Looking for to see de banjo.
