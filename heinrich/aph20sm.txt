1. Wherefore sweet maid sigh you so?
Why does your soft cheek fade?
Is it for joy, is it for woe,
Love is not joy, sweet maid!

2. O What has he for whom you sigh,
This is not also mine;
A breast on which you softly lie,
And a heart, but that is thine.

3. Therefore sweet maid, sigh not so,
Nor let your soft cheek fade;
Prithee! then love no more for woe,
But love for joy, swet Maid!
