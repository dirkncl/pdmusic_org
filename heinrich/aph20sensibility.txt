1. 
Sensibility, stay. O! for ever be mine, 
While a throb in my bosom can own your control; 
O! live in the heart that has bled at your shrine 
And ever exults with each sensi tive soul.

2. 
O! let not your absence once darken my mind, 
For a moment with deadliest heart chilling gloom, 
But illumine me ever with feelings refine’d, 
’Till my lifepulse is o’er and I sink to the tomb.
