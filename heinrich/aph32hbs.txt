Verse_Lyric: 1
Hail, beauteous Spring! 
Attendant queen of flowers! 
Who smiles doth bring 
from pleasures fairy bowers; 
Hail, beauteous Spring! 
Parent of virgin dews; 
With thee is seen 
The dance and laughing muse, 
With thee is seen 
The dance, and laughing muse, 
The dance, and laughing muse! 
Hail, beauteous Spring! 
We greet thy halcyon reign; 
Thy vocal choirs 
Shall wake the groves again: 
Thy song we hear, 
At eve and early morn, 
When rosy May 
With Flora treads the lawn. 
When rosy May 
With Flora, treads the lawn. 
With Flora treads the lawn. 
Hail,Hail, Hail! beauteous Spring! 
beauteous beauteous Spring!
