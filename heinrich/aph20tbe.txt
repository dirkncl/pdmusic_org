1. When I think of the days of my childhood and home 
Or dream of the years that have long passed away. 
The deep sigh of my heart will too often arise, 
And darken the sun of the happiest day. 
Tho’ thy mountains Columbia are dear to my soul, 
Thy woods and thy rivers surpassingly grand, 
Tho’ thy daughters and friends are so charming and true, 
Yet my heart will still feel for my own native land.

2. And I love thee, Columbia, with patriot zeal.
Thy soil ever dear with my blood I’d defend,
Should a foe to thy freedom dare step on thy shore,
That shore, which is always the Emigrant’s friend!
Then blame not the sigh that will sometimes arise,
For the land of my birth as a thought lingers there;
Yet no clime but my own, would induce me to roam,
From a century so free, and from daughters so fair!
