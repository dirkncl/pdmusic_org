1. My Harp that tuneless long has lain 
	To blank forgetfulness a prey, 
Once more renews its humble strain 
Not for applause or smiles to gain 
	But to its friends a tribute pay 

2. Ye friends belov’d, ye chosen few 
	Whose kindness claims my thanks sincere 
May Heav’n your paths with roses strew 
Nor pain or sorrow may you know 
	How long or short you wander here 
	How long or short you wander here 
	How long or short you wander here.

3. May plenty ope her silver horn,
	And strew its treasures at your feet
And may on gentle breezes borne,
Arise at eve and early morn,
	The song of GRATITUDE most sweet.

4. May all the blessings heaven bestows,
	On you like evening dew decend;
And when the stream of sorrow flows,
To calm your grief, and sooth your woes,
	O may you never want a FRIEND.
	O may you never want a FRIEND.
	O may you never want a FRIEND.
