Mary,  I believ’d thee true, 
And I was blest in thus believing; 
But now I mourn that e’er I knew 
A girl so fair, and so deceiving.
 A girl so fair, and so deceiving. 
How few have ever lov’d like me, 
Oh! I have lov’d thee too  sincerely! 
And few have e’er deceiv’d like thee like thee, 
Alas! deceiv’d me too severely! 
Fare thee, well Fare thee well, 
Fare thee well, yet think a while 
On one whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee, 
Who now would rather trust that smile, 
And die with thee, than live without thee! 
And die with thee than live withput thee! 
Fare thee well, yet think a while 
On one whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee 
Who now would rather trust that smile and die with thee
and die that live without thee! 
Mary! Mary! Fare thee well, I’ll think of  thee, 
Thou leav’st me many a bitter token bitter token; 
For see, distracted woman! see, 
My peace is gone, my heart is broken! broken­­ broken­­ broken! 
Fare thee well! Fare thee well!
