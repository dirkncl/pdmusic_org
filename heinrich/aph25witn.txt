1. Where is the nymph, whose azure eye,
Can shine through rapture’s tear?
The sun is sunk, the moon is high,
And yet she comes not here!
The sun is sunk, the moon is high,
And yet she comes not here.
Was that her foot step on the hill,
Her voice upon the gale?
No, ’twas the wind, and all is still
And all is still
Oh maid of Marly vale!
Maid of Marly vale!
Come to me, love, I’ve wander’d far,
’Tis past the promis’d hour; the promis’d hour;
Come to me, love, the twilight star,
Shall guide you to my bow’r.
Come to me, love, the twilight star,
Shall guide thee to my bower,
Maid of Marly vale!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Maid of Marly vale!

2. Haste lovely nymph, enchantress hie,
Respond my bosom’s thrill,
Ah no! she lists not to my sigh,
All, save the breeze is still,
Ah no! she lists not to my sigh,
All save the breeze is still,
Her rosy breath would blend the gale,
With soft enriching dew,
O! lovely maid, O! lovely maid!
O lovely maid of Marly vale!
Burst to my anxious view.
Yon brilliant orb’s, resplendent beam,
Illumes my lonely bower, my lonely bower.
Fain would I lull in magic’s dream,
But Ah! ’tis past the hour,
Fain would I lull in magic’s dream,
And bless the fairy power,
Fairy power.
