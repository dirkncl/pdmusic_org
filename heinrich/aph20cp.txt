* It is a fact, that Washington, Hamilton, Perry, Burrows, Bush, and indeed a large ma-

1. Our heroes of old are fast dying away, 
With the glory and honours of pa triots tried, 
And the Brave who succeed them but live for aday, 
Then die in the bloom of their laurels and pride. 
	And the Brave who succeed them but live for a day, 
	Then die in the bloom of their laurels and pride.

2. The few of the worthies, of Washington’s days,
Who remain in the land which their bravery blest,
Are indeed but a few!— and each morrow conveys
A statesman or warrior to glory and rest!
	Are indeed but a few!— and each morrow conveys
	A statesman or warrior to glory and rest!


3. Our tears are scarce dry for the warrior slain,
Or the statesman consigned to his halcyon grave,
Ere they flow for some favorite Son of the Main,
A _Bush_, or a _Burrows_, a _Lawrence_, so brave!
	Ere they flow for some favorite Son of the Main,
	A _Bush_, or a _Burrows_, a _Lawrence_, so brave!
