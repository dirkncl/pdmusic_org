1. Upon Ohio’s borders green
Dear Mary wandered young and fair,
Enraptured with the sylvan scene,
The sweetest charms of nature there!
But soon new transports dearly moved
Her virtuous heart, so long serene;
Young Edgar came and vow’d he loved,
Upon Ohio’s borders green.

2. The Maiden’s cheeks were crimsoned o’er,
As Edgar breathed his vows of love;
While sighs and blushes told him more,
Than language e’er attempts to prove.
They pledged their faith forever there,
And blessed the hallowed spot serene;
And now they rove the happiest pair,
Upon Ohio’s borders green.
