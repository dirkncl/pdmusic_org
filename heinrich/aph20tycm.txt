1. Of all our youths on land and sea,
Who guard the country’s liberty,
Give me the one so brave and free,
  The Young Columbian Midshipman.
He’s first in war the foe to dare,
He’s first in love to win the fair,
With him no one can I compare,
  The Young Columbian Midshipman.

2. When call’d to duty on the main,
He scorns delay, (our tears are vain),
But swears soon to return again,
  The Young Columbian Midshipman!
When ev’ry cannon’s echoing roar,
Gives glory to his native shore,
And honest laurels deck him o’er,
  The Young Columbian MidShipman!

3. His country serv’d, then friend or fair,
Engages all his gallant care,
And conquers both in peace or war,
  The Young Columbian Midshipman.
Let smiles increase his patient flame,
All hands entwine his wreath of fame,
And oft be sung his deathless fame,
  The Young Columbian Midshipman.
