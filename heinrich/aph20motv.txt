1. 
  Love, love me only, 
  Sovereign of beauty: 
Maid of the Vally; Delia divive; 
  Sweet are thy graces, 
  Fair blooming flower, 
Rose of the mountain; the pride of the bower.

2. 
  I am thine only, 
  O how sincerely! 
True to thee, dear, est, will I remain; 
  When far away, 
  A stranger I wander, 
Thoughts of my charmer will glad me again!
