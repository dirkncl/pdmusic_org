Words by Morgan Neville
Music by Anthony Philip Heinrich, 1781-1861

OVERTURE
To the fair Sylph of America
Miss Eliza Eustaphieve
Whose rising fame first reached the Wandering
Minstrel on the banks of the lovely Ohio, whence he
steered to hail this Star of the West, which dif-
fuses such radiance around the science of Music.
Inscribed
With feelings of admiration and gratitude for her
condescension in performing the firstlings of the author,
whilst he was a stranger to her in the wilds of Nature.
A. P. HEINRICH.
No. 4 of the Sylviad.

====================================
(1) Original Address of the Minstrel to Miss Eliza Eustaphieve,
during one of his rambles in the forests beyond the Alleghenies.

Fair Pupil of the tuneful Muse,
To thee by fancy'e hand is given,
The adored tunes the Angels chuse,
To waft their Minstrel through Heaven.

Columbia's Land the fame shall share,
That lingers round thy strains sublime;
That lingers round thy strains sublime;
And Europe's Europe's classic Maids prepare,
A wreath for thee and Russia's clime,
And Russia's clime.

Columbia's Land the fame shall share,
That lingers round thy strains sublime, and
Europes's classic Maids prepare
a wreath for thee and Europe's clime.

=========================
(2) "The Stranger Friend"
Concludes with the following prayer for the felicity of
Miss Eliza Eustaphieve.

Muscovia's pride may happiness impart
Its kindness trob to thy youthful heart;
thy youthful heart.

And bright as visions of the morning hour,
That around thee in thy fairy bower,
Pure as the numbers which thy strings controul.
May virtue reign triumphant in thy soul.
May virtue reign triumphant in thy soul
triumphant in thy soul.
