Let others boast of London Town, 
It’s Lords and Ladies, King and Crown! 
The grandeur there is empty show, 
And vain the praise of high and low, 
Compar’d to thee, whom all approve, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love! 
Compar’d to thee, whom all approve, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love! 
“Philadelphia!” 
No scene or clime can charm like thee, 
(And I have sail’d the world around,) 
For Beauty, Joy, and Friendship free, 
Thy Maids & Men are far renown’d, 
Then bless the spot which all approve, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love. 
“Brotherly Love,” “Brotherly Love, 
The maids who charm’d with love and song, 
The friends so true, so frank and free 
All that I’ve known so oft, so long, 
Shall ever in my mem’ry be, 
To bless the spot which all approve, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love, 
Fair City of Fraternal Love. 
Fair City of Fraternal Love, “Amore.” 
And when I’m forc’d to bid farewell, 
To all the charms that gain’d my heart, 
My humble Muse on all shall dwell, 
And sing the praise thy joys impart! 
And when I’m forc’d to bid farewell, 
To all the charms that gain’d my heart, 
My humble Muse, my humble Muse 
on, all, on all shall dwell, 
And sing the praise thy joys impart, 
And sing the praise thy joys impart, 
And sing the praise thy joys, thy joys impart, 
To bless  the spot which all approve, 
To bless the spot which all approve, 
Philadelphia.
