From thee Eliza, I must go, 
And from my native shore; 
The cruel fates between us throw, 
A boundless Ocean’s roar. 
But boundless Oceans roaring wide, 
Between my Love and me; 
They never, never can divide, 
My heart and soul from thee, 
my heart and soul from thee. 
Farewell! farewell Eliza dear! 
The maid that I adore; 
A boding voice is in my ear 
We part to meet no more 
But the last throb that leaves my heart, my heart 
While Death stands victor by 
That throb Eliza is thy part 
And thine that latest sigh, that latest sigh.
