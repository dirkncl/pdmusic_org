1. 
Say dearly lov’d Mary O! may  not the Bard 
Presume thus to hail you as one of the few 
Who soar above millions in heaven’s regard 
And heaven directed a heaven pursue (a heaven pursue).

2. 
O! why does he ask when the smile of your eye 
Has reveal’d so expressly tender and true, 
The sincerest regard for the  birth of a sigh, 
Which the finest of sensitive hearts ever knew (hearts ever knew).

3. 
While bright like the modest, the sun illum’d rose, 
Whose fragrance and bloom are so fully refin’d, 
The flush of your cheek has ne’er fail’d to disclose 
The heart cheering sweet, a fond, diffident mind (fond diffident mind).

4. 
And your roseate lips breathing perfumes around, 
Which give birth to the words of esteem and regard, 
Have prov’d in the mildest, melodious sound, 
That you  dearly can love the soft Song of the bard (soft Song of the bard).

5. 
Yes, Mary! each beauty discloses so true, 
Your affection for all that is tender and mild, 
That the Bard must indulge in this tribute to you, 
And exult, that he found, Sensibility’s Child (Sensibility’s Child).
