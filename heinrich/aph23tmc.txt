Hail the Minstrel! 
Hail the Minstrel! attend his lay! 
All the minstrel act I know, 
I the Viol well can play; 
I the pipe and syrinx blow, 
Harp and gigue my hand obey, 
Psaltry, symphony and rote, 
Help to charm the list’ning throng, 
And Armonia lends its note 
While I While I While I 
While I warble warble forth my song. 
While I warble forth my song 
I have tales and fables plenty, 
Satires, past’rals, full of sport. 
Songs to vielle I've more than twenty, 
Songs to vielle I’ve more than twenty, 
Ditties too, 
Ditties too of every sort, of every sort. 
I from lov ers tokens hear 
I can flow’ry chaplets weave, 
Am’rous belts can well prepare, 
And with courteous speech deceive.
