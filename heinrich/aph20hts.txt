1. 
Hast thou seen-- the cloud of morning, 
Veil with gloom the azure sky? 
Hast thou mark’d the rosy dawning, 
Wrapt in boding darkness fly? 
Thus each hope is fleeting ever, 
Pleasure meets us soon to sever! 
Thus each hope is fleeting ever, 
Pleasure meets us soon to sever­­ sever!

2. 
Hast thou seen the tempest over­
Radiant suns again illume; 
Threatening storms no longer hover, 
Nature bud with fresher bloom? 
Thus, through darkest clouds of even, 
Smiles the opening dawn of heaven! 
Thus, through darkest clouds of even, 
Smiles the opening dawn of heaven­­ heaven!
