1.
How sleep the Brave, who sink to rest,
By all their Country's wishes blest,
When spring with dewy fingers cold,
Re-turns to deck their hallow'd mould
She there shall dress a sweeter sod,
Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.
She there shall dress a sweeter sod,
Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.

2.
By Fairy bands their knell is rung,
By forms unseen their dirge is sung,
There, Honor comes a pilgrims grey,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay
And Freedom shall a while repair,
To dwell a Weeping Hermit there.
And Freedom shall a while repair,
To dwell a Weeping Hermit there.
