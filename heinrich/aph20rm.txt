1. 
Remember me while the heart can beat, 
Remember me while the rose is sweet, 
While the rose is sweet on its humble tree 
To feeling souls, remember me, remember me!

2. 
Remember me, while a nerve can feel 
The thorns which spring from a heart of steel 
While a heart of steel is a thorny tree 
Without a flow’r, remember me, remember me!

3. 
Remember me, while the smile of eyes 
Can raise the soul to the bliss  of skies; 
While the bliss of skies,   to misery 
Is turn’d by frowns, remember me, remember me!

4. 
Remember me, while the willow weeps, 
In night dew tears, where the lover sleeps; 
While the willow weeps, for his agony, 
Around his grave, remember me, remember me!
