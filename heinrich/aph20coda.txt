"Coda" (1820)
Words by William B. Tappan
Music by Anthony Philip Heinrich, 1781-1861

1.
My Harp awake! awake again,
O! strike the soul inspiring string,
No more in pensive notes complain,
But waft to gratitude the strain,
No more in pensive notes complain,
But waft to gratitude the strain,
And "Alma Mater's" off'ring bring.
And "Alma Mater's" off'ring bring.

2.
Ye friends most dear! this heart would pay
The grateful meed to kindness due;
And when afar that heart shall stray,
The wanderer-- urged by fate away--
And when afar that heart shall stray,
The wanderer-- urged be fate away--
His song of love shall wake to you.
His song of love shall wake to you.

3.
A _sylvan Muse_ in spires his theme
Yet kindly, Hope his bosom cheers,
That ye who bask in fancy's dream,
By _Pleasure_ wafted down the stream,
That ye who bask in fancy's dream,
By _Pleasure_ wafted down the stream,
May not disdain the _child of tears._
May not disdain the _child of tears._

4.
Ye generous _Patrons_ of the Muse,
May halcyon peace on you attend;
While smiling Love, the floweret strews,
May bland contentment ne'er refuse
While smiling Love, the floweret strews,
May bland contentment ne'er refuse
To crown with bliss the minstrel's _Friend._
To crown with bliss the minstrel's _Friend._
