For Love is Charity and thou art Love.

1. DAUGHTER of Heav’n! Philanthropy!
I catch the willing lyre,
And though untaught its minstrelsy,
Yet would I wake the strain to thee,
Do thou my song inspire, inspire.
Do thou, thou my song inspire.

2. Thy robes are of the morning hue,
Fair as the risen day;
Sweet is thy voice, to feeling true,
Thy tears like evening drops bedew,
Thy smiles new sweets display, new sweets display.

3. The Orphan knows thee, and the poor
Are seen within thy gates;
The widow shares thy liberal store,
The friendless bless thy open door,
Where Sympathy awaits. awaits,
Where Sym---­­, Sympathy awaits.

4. Beneath thy hospitable dome
Is liberal feeling fond;
Fair Candour there hath fixed her home,
Within thy walls, for those that roam,
Doth Charity abound, abound, abound.

5. Taught by the POWER before whose eye,
All hearts unveiled appear­­
The frailties that the proud decry,
Awake in thee, the feeling sigh,
And Pity gives the tear, the tear,
And Pi---­­, Pity gives the tear.

6. Philanthropy! alone are thine
The sweets of pleasure sure;
Thy impulse can the heart refine,
Can form it as its Source divine,
Immaculate and pure, and pure, and pure.

7. Where we discern thy form impressed,
Where liberal feeling moves­­
We view unnumbered mercies rest;
He is, and ever shall be blessed,
Whom Heaven with thee approves, approves,
Whom Heaven, Heaven with thee approves.
