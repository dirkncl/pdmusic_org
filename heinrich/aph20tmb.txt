1.
I would not wed the fairest lass,
  That ever sway'd oh beauty's throne;
Unless her heart like mirror'd glass,
  My ev'ry feeling, passion, shone.

2.
I would not we the wittiest maid,
  That ever touch'd a mortal's heart,
Unless her darts were merely played,
  In simple innocency's part.

3.
I would not wed the purest soul,
  That ever feeling governed most;
Unless her heart would bear control,
  And of its goodness never boast.

4.
I would not wed-- all else her own,
  A Queen, devoid of music's taste;
With her, my heart would be alone,
  Her palace seem a dreary waste.
