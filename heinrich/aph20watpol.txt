1.
Say where are the pleasures of life,
That mortals may hope to enjoy;
O where is comtent void of strife,
And the peace that is free from annoy?
Bright fancy with hope fast entwined,
May paint future scenes of delight;
But will they not beggar the mind
Like the empty fleet vision of night?

2.
Gay riches, which all would possess,
May dazzle and charm for a while;
But when racked with pain will they bless--
On the face of disease light a smile?
Blest Hygeia, that joy giving power,
May tend oft from trouble to save;
But will it from death beds insure,
Or exempt mortal man from the grave?

3.
Kind Friendship a care soothing balm,
May assuage with its tender of love;
But the terrors of death will it calm?
Ah no! nought for peace from above.
Then where are the pleasures of life,
That mortals may hope to enjoy;
O where is content void of strife,
And the peace that is free from annoy?
