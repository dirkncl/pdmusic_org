1. 
On prancing steeds three Yagers sprang,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
Their sweethearts fair thus sweetly sang,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
No other tear shall stain, they cried,
The check a warrior’s kiss has dried,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
Then all for glory fly!
Then all for glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!

2. 
A thousand more are on the field,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
With martial sounds the skies are fill’d,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
Then where is he so mean and shy,
In woman’s arms would trembling lie,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
When all the glory fly!
When all the glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!

3. 
And where, young warrior dost thou fly?
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
With dauntless brow and eagle eye;
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
To meet the foe that fiercely comes,
To spoil our fields and sacred homes;
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
I too for glory fly!
I too for glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!

4. 
Our Country calls­­ the Yager hears,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
We give her hope and calm her fears,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
The for the foe­­ and leave behind,
On its bleak sides the mountain wind,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
When we for glory fly!
When we for glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!

5. 
Where cannons dread their lightnings flash,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
And sword meets sword in fearful crash,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
The Yager there still spurs his steed,
Whilst ’neath his hoof the foe doth bleed,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
For we to glory fly!
For we to glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!

6. 
For now we pant for war’s alarms,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
To Love, and Beauty’s twining arms
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
We go­­ but in the dreadful fight,
For us, dark danger path you’ll light,
  Adieu, Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!
For all to glory fly!
For all to glory fly!
  Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza!
