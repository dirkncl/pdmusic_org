Dearer than sweetest vernal flow'rs,
Thy image comes to cheer
My thoughts, like music in lone hours,
When all around is drear,
When all around is drear.

Fairer to me than sparkling gem,
Thine eyes turn on me now;
O may I place _Hope's diadem_
Upon thy happy brow
Upon thy happy brow.

As vesper shades come stealing o'er
The mem'ries of the past,
May our fond love still welling o'er,
In all its freshness last,
In all its freshness last.
