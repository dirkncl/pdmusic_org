1. 
Fare well! my Parents, Sisters dear, 
My Brothers, and my Friends adieu, 
I can’t restrain the tender tear, 
That wets my cheek leaving you. 
Ere to my destin’d skies I do, 
And part from all I love so dear, 
My heart will swell with deepest woe, 
My heart will swell with deepest woe. 

[Refrain] [sung after each verse]
My eyes rain many a briny tear, a  briny tear.

2. 
Dear parents, when I’m far from you, 
In man y a pleasing and airy dream, 
You and my joys a gain I view, 
And absence be my constant theme. 
Companions of my youthful years, 
Ye girls with whom in mirth I’ve toy’d, 
Of you I’ll often think, while tears, 
Shall bring to mind sports once enjoy’d.

3. 
To wards a foreign clime I steer, 
And should my stars propitious shine, 
Perhaps of my return you’ll hear, 
And I no more in absence pine. 
But from this life should I depart, 
Ere I return from whence I’m bound, 
Mayhap, for me some tender heart, 
Will gently heave a sigh profound.
