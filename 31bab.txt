"Buy a Broom" (circa 1831)
(The Bavarian Girl's Song)
Words by D. O. Meara
Music from the German "Augustin"
Arranged by Alexander Lee

Pretty Lady, pretty Gentleman,
From mine Vaterland I do bring,
De little broom so new, so bran
and buy a broom I sing,
Buy a Broom, pretty broom, pretty Broom I sing.
Pretty little Broom is of much use,
when your lover go astray,
should de fond one ever you abuse
you den whip him away wid de Broom,
Pretty broom, wid de broom whip him away
away away wid de Broom whip him away.
I once had a sworn true Lover,
But he soon prove false to me,
So I cross'd dat big Sea over
Hoping truer friends to see.
Buy my broom, buy a broom pretty broom I cry,
Pretty Lady, pretty Gentleman
buy a broom pretty broom,
Buy a broom pretty broom
buy a Broom! Buy buy a Broom.
