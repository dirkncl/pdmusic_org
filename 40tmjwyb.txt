[She] 1. Tell me Josey whar you bin? 
To leave me this way is a sin. 
You left me all alone to sigh, 
It is a wonder I didn’t die. 
[She] Tell me Josey whar you bin? 
[He] The way I love her is a sin. 
[She] Tell me then or I shall die. 
[He] If you drop I’m sure  to sigh.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
[She] Tell me Josey whar you bin? 
To leave me this way is a sin. 
You left me all alone to sigh. 
It is a wonder I didn’t die. 

[He] 2. Lubly Dinah then I’ll tell you. 
It happened in an oyster celler.
A nigger hit me wid a stick
And I laid him flat wid a large big brick. 
[He] I laid him right out on the stone
[She] Joe you didn’t break his bone.
[He] Yes I heard something crack. 
[She] Oh! Joe you’ve broke the nigger’s back.

[She] 3. Now tell me Joe if You will marry
Case I can no longer tarry.
You’re the nigger I admire.
You’ve set my bustling heart on fire. 
[She] Now tell me Joe if you love me.
[He] Dar an’ more that I adore above thee.
[She] My heart with love now is pouting.
[He] Oh! Massa how she works my feeling.


[He] 4. Oh! lubly Rose lures my hand.
No wench could bare it in this land.
You are my thoughts by day and night.
Oh! Dinah she’s a beautiful sight.
[He] How I do adore the creature.
[She] Lord he’s got spendid feature.
[He] She’s the only wench I pray see.
[She] He's stole my heart away from me.
