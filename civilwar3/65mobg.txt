1. The sky has lost its brightness,
  The flowers seem not fair,
They throw no genial perfume
  Upon the evening air.
The birds no longer gaily
  Chant sweetest songs for me.
The sun looks down so coldly
  Upon my misery.
    The sun looks down so coldly
    Unon my misery.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I’m sad at heart and weeping
  Since left on earth alone;
The world is cold and dreary.
  My only brother’s gone.

2. He went to fight for country,
  For freedom, and for right,
He fell in hard fought battle
  Beneath the stars of night.
He fell as noble heroes,
  Of olden times did fall,
And when he died so nobly,
  I lost my earthly all,
   And when he died so nobly,
    I lost my earthly all.

3. He went to join our mother,
  Our generours father too,
In lands beyond the starlight,
  Where all is good, and true;
They wrapped him in the banner
  He loved so fondly, well,
And laid him ’neath the clover,
  Upon the spot he fell.
    And laid him ’neath the clover,
    Upon the spot he fell.
