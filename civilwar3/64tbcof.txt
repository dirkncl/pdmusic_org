1.
Our flag is proudly floating on the land and on the main,
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom;
Beneath it oft we've conquer'd and will conquer oft again,
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.

CHORUS
Our Dixie forever, she's never at a loss--
Down with the eagle and up with the cross;
We'll rally 'round the bonny flag, we'll rally once again--
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

2.
Our gallant boys have marched to the rolling of the drum
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.
And leaders in charge cry, "come boys come,"
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.

CHORUS
Our Dixie forever, she's never at a loss--
Down with the Eagle and up with the Cross;
We'll rally 'round the bonny flag, we'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

3.
They may have laid down their lives on the bloody battle-field
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.
Their motto is resistance--"To tyrants we'll not yield,"
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.

CHORUS
Our Dixie forever, she's never at a loss--
Down with the Eagle and up with the Cross;
We'll rally 'round the bonny flag, we'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

4.
While our boys have responded and to the field have gone
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.
Our noble women also have aided them at home,
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.

CHORUS
Our women forever, God bless them, huzza!
With their smiles and favors, they aid us in the way;
In the tent and on the battle-field, the boys remember them
And cheer for the daughters of freedom.

5.
Let the joyous sound re-echo o'er the land and o'er the sea
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.
Our Southern sky is brightening and soon we will be free
  Shout, shout the battle cry of freedom.

CHORUS
Our Dixie is forever, she's never at a loss--
Down with the Eagle and up with the Cross;
We'll rally 'round the bonny flag, we'll rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
