1. Come mother, dear mother, oh! come to me now!
My soul wings its flight, I would see thee once more,
Again I would feel thy dear hand on my brow
One moment on earth, ere the struggle is o’er.
Ere life’s pulse is stilled, and the cold chill of death,
Creeps o’er my heart; I would see thee once more
Fond words of farewell; with my very last breath
I’d whisper to thee from eternity’s shore.

2. Thou’lt hear dearest mother, alas! not from me,
I hunted the foe thro’ green valley and crag,
For stamped on my brain wre the last words from thee
Though life be the forfeit, be true to thy flag!
Those words nerved my arm when I struck the bold blow
For my country, my flag, for glory, for thee
But now all is over, I’ve done with earth’s foe,
For heaven’s bright portals are opening to me.
