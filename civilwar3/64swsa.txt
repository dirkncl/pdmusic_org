1. The bells are hush’d, the world is still,
The sounds of toil are heard no more,
The bird has ceas’d his tuneful song,
And heav’n with stars is spangled o’er.

[REFRAIN sung after verses 1 and 2]
Sleep well, sleep well,
And let thy lovely eyelids close,
sleep well, sleep well,
dear angel, sweet be thy repose.

2. Oh! didst thou think of me today?
The tho’t of thee my heart could fill,
And now, to breathe a fond good night,
Beside thy door I linger still.

3. There comes to thee from heav’nly realms,
a holy messenger to night,
He brings you bright and peaceful dreams,
till you awake in morning’s light,
[REFRAIN]
sleep well, sleep well,
and let thy lovely eyelids close,
sleep well, sleep well,
dear angel, sweet by thy repose.
Sleep well, dear angel, sweet by thy repose.
