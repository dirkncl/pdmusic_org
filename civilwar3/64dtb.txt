1.
Now the foes' long lines are charging,
 On our brave and faithful band;
Tho' we're falling still we meet them,
 Face to face and hand to hand.
Dreadful is the fate of the battle,
 But our cause is ever just;
And we'll never leave our banner,
 Till each traitor sleeps in dust.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dreadful is the fate of the battle,
 But our cause is ever just;
And we'll never leave our banner,
 Till each traitor sleeps in dust.

2.
Here, beneath a maple's shadow,
 I am tying in my blood;
And I'm growing weak and weaker,
 By the ebbing of the flood.
Near around me are the dying,
 Comrades who had fought so well,
Till the death-wing'd missle pierc'd them,
 And they bravely, nobly fell.

3.
And I hear them calling, mother,
 For some loved one left at home;
But amid this dreadful slaughter,
 Those dear loved ones cannot come.
O with water, cooling water,
 Mother to your darling come,
For my fever dreams are haunted
 By the mossy spring at home!

4.
Now my eyes grow dim my mother,
 And my heart beats faint and slow,
Still I see our dear old banner,
 Waving o'er the conquer'd foe!
Still I hear our cannon's thunder,
 And our soldiers' victory yell!
God of battles, Thou hast saved us,
 Mother! mother all is well!
