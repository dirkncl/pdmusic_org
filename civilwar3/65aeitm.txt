"At Eight in the Morning" [1865]
At eight in the morning
Brave Weitzel so true,
Marched into the town
With his Heroes in Blue.

1. Now Richmond has fallen, rebellion is done,
Let all men rejoice for the vict’ry is won,
The city where slav’ry once dwelt in her pride,
Is now in our hearts and rebellion has died;
Now Richmond is taken, they’ll harm us no more,
For treason is crush’d and rebellion is o’er,
Our armies have triumphed, the traitors have fled,
We’ve captur’d their city; secession is dead.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Long live our great heroes who once were enslav’d,
We honor our soldiers, so loyal and brave,
They’ve grappled with traitors and fought for the State,
They carried our Flag thro’ the great city’s gate.

2. At eight in the morning brave Weitzel so true
Marched into the town with its heroes in blue,
The slave that oppression had bound with her chain,
Went forward our laws and our rights to maintain;
O’erpowr’d by the tyrant who reigned in his might,
Deprived of their freedom, forbidden their rights,
Ground down by oppression, shut out from the light,
For years they had dwelt in the darkness of night.

3. Long years the poor African grovelled in dust,
Yet patiently waiting in God he did trust;
The Savior hath blest him and given him light,
He’s fought for his Country, his God, and the Right.
And now he rejoices his trials are o’er,
The lash of the tyrant shall scourge him no more,
Our armies have conquered and won the great fight,
Our legions have crushed the proud foe in his might.
