"Ever My Spirit Awakens to Thee" (1865)
(Answer to "Beautiful Dreamer" [by S. C. Foster])
Words by Miss Maggie Williams
Music by E. Mack

1.
Waked by the notes of sweet melody,
Listen! the soft strains are speaking to me,
Telling of dewgrops and starlight so bright,
World hush'd to rest 'neath the moon's gentle light;
Bright glist'ning dewdrops may mantle the vale,
Pow'rless thy dreamer from slumber to free;
Starlight grow dim and mild moonlight may pale,
Ever my spirit awakens to thee,
Ever my spirit awakens to thee.

2.
Mermaids may chant their notes o'er the sea,
Vain is their music, their wild song to me,
Over the streamlet light breezes be borne,
Vapors arising may wait for the morn;
Not the light breezes arising tonight
Tell the sweet tale of thy love unto me;
Nor the bright moon with its beauty and light;
Ever my spirit awakens to thee,
Ever my spirit awakens to thee.
