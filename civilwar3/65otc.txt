1. Sherman! thou hast Glory won 
On to Charleston onward on 
He who hath his quarrel just, 
Thrice is armed and conquer must. 
Let those in their rebel home, 
See the conq’ring heroes come! 
Armed with sabre, lance and gun! 
On to Charleston! Onward! on!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Let those in their Rebel home, 
See the conquering Heroes come! 
Armed with sabre, lance and gun! 
On to Charleston, Onward on!

2. Gratitude we shall return; 
Thine shall be a “storied urn,” 
Thine is a heroic name! 
Thine is a historic fame! 
Siren tonques in martial lays, 
Chant the Anthems of thy praise. 
Beauty’s hands are weaving now, 
Many chaplets for thy brow!

3. Worthy thou to lead the van! 
War inflict where war began! 
Thunders hear we from afar— 
Thunders from thy cloud of war! 
Lightnings flash on fancy’s eye— 
Lightnings from thy torrid sky— 
Tokens of the South’s alarm, 
Tokens of thy conq’ring arm!

4. Sovereign of Atlanta’s fate! 
Hero at Savannah’s gate! 
East and West and North and South, 
Hail thee at the cannon’s mouth! 
If, to fall, shall be thy doom, 
Monumental be thy tomb! 
Flow’rs shall grow around its base, 
Wet by tears  from beauty’s face.
