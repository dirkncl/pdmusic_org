1.
Oh! hear the joyful singing,
 While our armies onward roam;
To you, the news 'tis bringing,
 "Our boys are coming home!"
The war will soon be over
 In vic'try then will come,
Each husband, friend and lover [loser?],
 When our boys arrive at home!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The soldier boys are coming
 With their bayonets, fife and drum!
We hear the bullets humming,
 Our boys are coming home!
Our boys are coming home!
 Our boys are coming home!
We hear the bullets humming,
 Our boys are coming home!

2.
Ring out the joyful tidings
 From mountain, hill and plain,--
Our ships the storms out riding,
 Will anchor safe again;
Soon will cease mad treason's battle,
 God our helper has become,
We hear the cannon's rattle;
 "Our boys are coming home!"

3.
Oh, there'll be shouting, sighing,
 There'll be beating hearts for some,
There'll be sobbing, laughing, crying,
 When the soldier boys come home.
Then traitor hearts will tremble
 'Neath Freedom's sacred dome,
When her armies shall assemble,
 And our boys are welcom'd home!

4.
Oh, glad will be the meeting
 With the true hearts strong and brave,
Who have swept the foe retreating,
 From forest land and wave.
Tho' their clothes be old and tatter'd,
 Bough-grae'd and sunburnt some,
Tho' their ranks be thine and scatter'd,
 All the prouder they will come.

5.
We will wreath their names with glory,
 In the nation's heart of love,
And for sun and grandsire hoary,
 We will pray to God above;
To give them health and blessing
 From heav'ns choicest store,
Sweet home and fond caressing,
 When our boys are home once more.

6.
God bless the weeping mothers,
 Whose boys are with the slain,
The heroic sons and brothers,
 Who fight on land and main.
God bless our starry banner,
 On lake or ocean foam.
God bless our land forever,
 And bring our soldiers home.

7.
In a holy cause we're fighting,
 'Gainst oppression's power and strife,
Then let us all uniting,
 Strike for _Freedom, God_ and _Right!_
Soon peace shall bless our vision,
 Our Union strong become,
And blossom joy's elysian
 When our boys shall dwell at home!
