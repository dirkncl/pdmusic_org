1. When I left my happy home, dear mother,
To fight for the red, white, and blue;
I thought it to be my duty, mother,
And you know that you thought so too,
I knew ’twould be hard to leave you, mother,
And that when the time came to part;
Your tears would flow like the rain, mother,
From the depth of your true loving heart.

2. But brave comrads were calling me on, dear mother, 
And sadly I  left you alone,
To fight with an army of Patriots, mother,
For my country, my flag, and my home.
Since then, I have seen many hardships, mother,
We have all met the foe face to face;
My friends have fallen one by one mother,
And there’ll soon be one more vacant place.

3. I am wounded and dying, dear mother,
A shot through my vitals has passed,
And the blood trickles slow from my side, mother,
And I know that my life cannot last,
I have prayed that I once more might see you mother,
And have wished— O! so much, you were here;
To sooth my path to the grave, mother,
When the angel of death shall draw near. 

4. There is one who I’m sure will miss me, mother,
Who often has sat by my side;
I have longed for this war to be ended, mother,
For I then was to make her my bride.
That bright dream is slowly passing, mother,
I feel that it never can be,
I soon shall sleep ’neath the sod, mother,
While she will be weeping for me.

5. You may bid her farewell for me, dear mother,
And for me on her cheek print a kiss,
And tell her I hope to meet her, mother,
In a world that is better than this;
To that beautiful place I am going, mother,
Bright angels are hovering near,
They have come to bear me away, mother,
Farewell! then farewell! mother dear.
