1. Well, the happy day has come, Kate,
The blessed day of peace,
And a peace our country never had before,
For we now can proudly sat,
Since the bloody strife has ceased,
That we have a land that’s free from shore to shore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let us sing then for joy,
For our country’s truly free,
For a slave shall tread its precious soil no more,
And the stars and stripes shall wave,
Over land and over sea,
As a banner of the heavenly golden shore.

2. I remember well the hour, Kate,
Your eyes were fill’d with tears,
As you kiss’d and told me “take your gun and go.”
And you said that God would keep me,
You bid me have no fears,
For our country call and you must surely go.

3. Oh! the many bitter tears, Kate,
This cruel war has made,
And the thousand vacant homes all o’er the land!
But we know that God is just
And that liberty won’t fade.
Tho’ the sacrifice should be an angel band.
