1. Weep not, dearest, that I leave thee,
For a brighter world on high;
Did my parting not bereave thee,
Oh! how happy could I die!
All our joys must end in sadness,
All our pleasures must decay.
And hearts that now beat high with gladness,
May tomorrow pass away.

2. I leave thee not alone to languish,
Mourning for the one that’s fled,
To break thy heart with rending anguish,
In hopeless grief to droop thy head;
My spirit still shall hover near thee,
In the hours of darksome woe,
To soothe, to comfort and to cheer thee
And dry thy teardrops as they flow.

3. Draw nearer to me, I am dying!
Earth is fading from my sight,
And its shadows swiftly flying,
Day is dark as cheerless night;
Beloved, farewell! I go to regions
Where no sorrow o’er can come,
Where angels move in countless legions,
There shall be my future home.
