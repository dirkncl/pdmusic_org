1. 
Shout the battle cry,
Raise our flag on high
In our noble cause we’ll prevail.
Men are faithful, Nations grateful,
With such leaders we shall never fail.

CHORUS
Hurrah! hurrah!
Shout for Blaine and Logan,
Hurrah! hurrah!
Hurrah for one and all;
Hurrah! hurrah!
Shout for Blaine and Logan,
They are leaders of a mighty band.

2. 
Let us every one,
For our noble sons
Work until we’ve won victory;
For our cause is right,
And in every fight
They are mighty heroes, and must win.

3. 
Loud our voices swell,
Names we love so well,
Let us work for them great and small.
When the voting’s done,
And the vict’ry won,
We will cheer them loudly, one and all.
