1.
We will stand by the Union for ever,
  By the flag of the brave and the true,
By the glorious star spangled banner,
  With its beautiful red, white, and blue.

CHORUS
See it waving, waving, waving,
  'Tis freedom's emblem fair,
See it waving, waving, waving,
  Its glorious triumph there.

2.
O its folds to the free air of heaven,
  By our fathers unfurled long ago,
Shall ne'er wave o'er America riven,
  By the hand of a traitorous foe.

(CHORUS)

3.
On the field o'er the dead and the dying,
  Where the loud din of battle is rife,
See our emblem of liberty flying,
  Oh, its triumph is dearer than life.

(CHORUS)

4.
Let us trust in the might of Jehovah,
  For the right with His might must prevail,
With the flag of the free floating over
  Our hosts, O we never shall fail.

(CHORUS)

5.
Three times three for the Union for ever,
  Three times three for the brave and the true,
Three times three for the star spangled banner,
  With its beautiful red, white, and blue.

(CHORUS)
