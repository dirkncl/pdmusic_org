1. 
Oh! I think it very pleasant
To promenade the street,
And gaze upon the fashions
Of each pretty girl you meet,
They’ve such little hats, and bonnets,
And boots, (cost nine of ten)
Which makes them altogether
More expensive than the men.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, dear! it makes my feel so shy,
When ere I meet upon the street
The gal with a roquish eye!
Oh, dear! it makes me feel so shy.
When ere I meet upon the street
The gal with a roguish eye!

2. 
Among the smiling faces
There’s one above the rest,
Who dresses with the greatest care,
And of the very best!
She don’t appear to mind me
When ere she’s passing by,
But drops her veil clear o’er her face,
To hide her roquish eye!

3. 
I went home for consolation,
To ma, the other day,
And told her all about my love
With the sweet maiden gay.
“Good gracious bless the darling by!”
These words my mother said,
“Why don’t you dress up in you best
And go and spark the maid!”

4. 
I mustered all my courage up,
And called one afternoon,
And met her father face to face;­­
He kicked me from the room.
He lifted me so neatly
Clear out into the street,
And landed me upon my head,
Instead of upon my feet!

5. 
I regained my scattered senses,
And began to look about,
When I heard a voice of sweetness sing,
“Does mother know you’re out!”
I turned the corner in a rage,
Midst laughter, yell and din,
Determined then to drown myself,
But found I couldn’t swim!
