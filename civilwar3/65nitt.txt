"Now Is the Time[!]" [23 Mar 1865]
[cover+ "Take All Your Chance."]

  Now is the time,
  Take all your chance
For making soon your Fortune,
  Like all good things,
  There three should be,
So each can try a portion.
  IF you are brave
  And not a slave
To minor consideration:
  You go to Blunt's,
  Tale up the Funds,
And march to help the nation.

1. Now is the time, take all your chance
For making soon your fortune,
Like all good things, there three should be,
So each can try a portion
If you are brave and not a slave,
To, minor consid’rations.
You go to Blunt’s, take up the funds
And march to help the nation.

CHORUS 1
If you are brave and not a slave
To minor consid’rations,
You go to Blunts, take up the funds
And march to help the nation.

2. In case you should or rather would
Stay home for peaceful notions.
Buy up the gold, that’s daily sold
To keep you in commotion
My last advise is quite a price,
It has become a mania.
Go on the soil and pump the oil,
In lucky Pennsylvania.

CHORUS 2
My last advice, is quite a price,
It has become a mania.
Go on the soil and pump the oil,
In lucky Pennsylvania.

3. There’s change in times I judge by signs,
By fancy decorations.
It took effect on ladies’s heads
To husbnds’ consternation,
There’s  none to blame but Uncle Sam
With pockets full of greenbacks.
But to be fair we give a share
To Petroleum Oil casks.

CHORUS 3
There’s none to blame but Uncle Sam,
With pockets full of geenbacks,
But to be fair, we give a share,
To Petroleum Oil casks.

4. Just going to press, there is distress
All over this good city.
This is no fun for any one
Nor time for being witty.
They turn the wheel, it’s hardly real,
You hear them call your name.
And you are made with out your aide,
A hero left to fame.

CHORUS 4
They turn the wheel, it’s hardly real,
You hear them call your name,
And you are made with out your aide,
A hero left to fame.
