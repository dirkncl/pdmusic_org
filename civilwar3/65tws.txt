"The Whip-Poor-Will's Song" (1865)
A Ballad
[The Echo of the Whip-poor-will may be repeated
by another voice at a distance, or in another
roo, with vary fine effect.]
by Harrison Millard (1830-1895)

1.
Oh, meet me when when daylight is fading,
  And is darkening into the night;
When songbirds are singing their vespers,
  And the day has far vanished from sight;
And then I will tell to you, darling,
  All the love I have cherished so long,
If you will but meet me at evening,
  When you hear the first whip-poor-will's song.

REFRAIN
Whip-poor-will! Whip-poor-will!
You hear the first whip-poor-will's song;
Oh, meet me; oh, meet me,
When you hear the first whip-poor-will's song.

2.
'Tis said that whatever sweet feeling
  May be throbbing within a find heart,
When list'ning to whip-poor-will's singing,
  For a twelve-month will never depart;
To then we will meet in the woodland,
  Far away from the hurrying throng,
And whisper our love to each other,
  When we hear the first whip-poor-will's song.

(REFRAIN)

3.
And in the long years of the future,
  Through our duties may part us awhile,
And on the return of the evening,
  We are severed by many a mile;
Yet deep in our bosoms we'll cherish
  The affection so fervent and strong,
We pledged to each other this evening,
  When we heard the first whip-poor-will's song.

(REFRAIN)
