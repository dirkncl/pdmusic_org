1. O, Land of Columbia how glorious the sight,
When millions of freemen rise up in their might,
To battle for Union and Liberty’s cause
And aid in defending thy time honor’d laws;
“The Union it must and shall be preserved”
Was said by a sage, who from duty ne’er swerved;
So 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
we say. let traitors decide what they will,
The flag of Columbia shall float o’er us still,
Shall float o’er us still, shall float o’er us still,
The flag of Columbia shall float o’er us still.

2. Our watchword in battle, whenever we fight
Is “Freedom and Union“ and “God speed the right'”
Each day brings us wisdom and strength to withstand
The whole world together, if foe to our lands:
“United we stand divided we fall”
Was said by a patiot well known to us all;
So

3. The monarchs of Europe may well stand aghast,
And own that the day of their tyranny’s past;
Oppression shall vanish and peoples be freed.
They call on us now in the hour of their need:
“The Union of States th’nforcement of laws”
Will prove to the world that Heaven blesses our cause,
And
