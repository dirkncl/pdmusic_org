1. Thank God, the sky is clearing!
  The clouds are hurrying past;
Thank God, the day is nearing,
  The dawn has come at last,
And when glad herald voices,
  Shall tell us peace has come,
This thought shall most rejoice us;
  “Our boys are coming home!”

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Our boys are coming home!
  Our boys are coming home!
This thought shall most rejoice us—
  Our boys are coming home! 

2. Soon shall the voice of singing
  Drown war’s tremendous din;
Soon shall the joybells ringing
  Bring peace and freedom in.
The jubilee bonfires burning,
  Shall soon light up the dome,
And soon to soothe our yearning,
  “Our boys are coming home!”

3. The vacant fireside places
  Have waited for them long;
The lovelight lacks their faces,
  The chorus waits their song;
A shadowy fear has haunted
  The long deserted room;
But now our prayers are granted,
  Our boys are coming home.

4. O mother, calmly waiting
  For that beloved son!
O sister, proudly dating
  The victories he has won!
O maiden, softly humming
  The love song while you roam—
Joy, joy, the boys are coming—
  Our boys are coming home!

5. And yet— O, keenest sorrow!
  They’re coming, but not all;
Full many a dark tomorrow
  Shall wear its sable pall.
For thousands who are sleeping
  Beneath the empurpled loam;
Woe! woe! for those we’re weeping,
  Who never will come home!

6. O sad heart, hush the grieving;
  Wait but a little while!
With hoping and believing
  Thy woe and fear beguile,
Wait for the joyous meeting
  Beyond the starry dome,
For there our boys are waiting
  To bid us welcome home.
