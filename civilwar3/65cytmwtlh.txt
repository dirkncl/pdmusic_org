1. Can you tell me where they laid him,
Where they laid my darling boy,
Where the cruel hands that slayed him,
Buried all my hope and joy?
O, my heart is sad with weeping,
And my tears like rain drops fall,
For my darling now is sleeping,
Hearing not a mother’s call.

CHORUS 1
Far away my your darling’s sleeping,
But no loved one mourns him there;
No fond mother o’er him weeping,
Breathes affection’s gentle prayer.

2. Could I plant the weeping willow
Where his ashes now repose,
Could I by his lonely pillow,
Plant the lily and the rose,
Sweet would be the task of sadness,
Sweet would be the tears I shed,
When I strewed, with joy and gladness,
Flowers around the loved and dead.

CHORUS 2 & 3.
Roses bloom not where he’s lying,
Flowers sweet deck not his grave;
But the zephyrs soft are sighing
Mournful dirges o’er the brave.

3. Had I heard his last faint sighing,
Had I knelt beside him there,
Had I while he yet was dying,
Breathed o’er him a mother’s prayer,
I would cease my mourning, weeping,
Though his grave I seek in vain;
Ah! my heart, its sadness keeping,
Breaks with sorrow and with pain.
