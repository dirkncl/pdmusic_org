1. Man may die! still joined our hands!
Lincoln falls! the Union stands!
Savious of our Land and Laws!
Dies the Martyr! lives the cause!
Lincoln dies! the Good and Great!
Waves our Flag o’er ev’ry State!
Wears a martyr’s Crown on High!
He whose name shall nev er die.

2. O’er the distant waste of Time,
Freedom’s bells his dirge shall chime,
In the Belfry of his fame,
An eternal tow’ of flame.
Throwing out both sound and light,
Sound for day and light for night
Guiding, cheering the oppress’d
Freedom’s Mecca of the West.
