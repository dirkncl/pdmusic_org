1.
Ho! the glorious day is rolling on
the battle fought the victory won!
and that will be the "good time" _come_
when we all march home from the war.
The "stars and stripes" will flash above,
as on our way we proudly move,
To greet the dear ones that we love
when we all march home from the war.

CHORUS 1
When we all march home from the war,
To greet the dear ones that we love 
when we all march home from the war.

2.
Well done brave boys 'twill then be said
to Tommy and Willie and Johnny and Ned
and sumptuous dinners for us will be spread
when we all march home from the war.
Hurrah for the lasses that we love best!
God bless 'em for sure they deserve to be blest
Oh! what a soft flutter creeps under our vest
as we all march home from the war.

CHORUS 2
As we all march home from the war,
Oh! what a soft flutter creeps under our vest
as we all march home from the war.

3.
There'll be weddings to day and weddings tomorrow
and honey moons gay take the place of our sorrow
our cares aside and no trouble we'll borrow
when we all march home from the war.
And together we'll raise our Joyous mirth
around the happy domestic hearth
Singing "good will to me" and "peace on earth"
when we all march home from the war.

CHORUS 3
When we all march home from the war
Singing "good will to men" and "peace on earth"
when we all get home from the war.
