1. Up with the starry banner.
  Down with the stars and bars.
God bless the flag that’s floated
  In three successful wars.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Up with our nation’s banner,
The glorious stripes and stars
Down with the traitors emblem
Down with the stars and bars.

2. Up with the starry banner,
  Down with the traitor foe.
The Government our fathers made
  Is the only one we know.

3. Up with the starry banner,
  Forever let it fly,
A sign of hope to nations far
  A beacon in the sky.

4. Up with the starry banner,
  The banner of our love,
That came to us by angel hands
  From regions far above.

5. Up with the starry banner,
  Let it float o’er the land
Aye, from the broad St. Lawrence
  Unto the Rio Grande.

6. Up with the starry banner,
  With not a star obscured
But purified and hallowed
  In all it hath endured.
