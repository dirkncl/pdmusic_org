1. In this land of the free, not a slave shall there be 
As a cause for rebellion or treason 
Each fetter and chain in the sod shall be lain 
For this, if for no other reason. 

[REFRAIN] and CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
As brothers all, then follow the call, 
For Freedom and Emancipation: 
A man is a man deny it who can, 
It shall be so at least in this nation. 

2. Oh who is so vile as to linger and smile 
When a man to the slave pen is driven, 
And sold like a beast, his poor body at least, 
Tho’ his soul may be ransomed in Heaven.

3. With the blood of the slain, we will wipe out the stain 
Which forced men to blush for this nation 
That bartered and sold men and women for gold 
Who oft were of kindred relation. 

4. A white slave or black, is a man for all that, 
Tho’ the law may deny him his station, 
The birth-right of all is to join in the call 
for _God and for Emancipation_.

5. We offer the hand to all in this land 
Who are fighting for our preservation, 
Upholding just laws and Freedoms’ great cause 
And the Union of all this great nation. 

6. The nation shall grow and to other lands show, 
This Republic is firm in foundation, 
And Despots shall feel that republican steel, 
Is sharp in defence of this nation.

7. This land of the free still a refuge shall be 
For all the oppress’d who are driven 
To exile from home, to as many as come, 
To each an asylum is given. 

8. Then join in the cry ’till it reaches the sky, 
And there is recorded forever, 
There’ll nor be a slave, in this “home of the brave” 
If there is, we his fetters will sever.
