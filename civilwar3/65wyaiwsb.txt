1. O, the stormy times we knew 
In our suit of army blue, 
When you and I were sold ier boys together Will; 
Ere they laid you in the soil 
Where a glory crowns your toil, 
As the Spring time crowns the gloomy winter weather, Will!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O, gallant, gallant Will, 
Your noble heart is still 
Where the river waves roll in the sun, 
You nevermore will thrill 
At the wild bugle’s toll, 
Nor wake at the roar of the gun. 
Nor march to the wardrum rolling, 
Nor march to the wardrum rolling,
Nor shout when the battle is won.

2. Ah we lov’d each other more, 
For the trials that we bore 
When you and I were soldier boys in battle, Will; 
And our hearts the stronger grew 
For the dangers we pass’d thro’ 
Mid cannon’s crash and rifle’s deadly rattle, Will.

3. Tho’ my fighting time has pass’d 
Like a storm upon the blast, 
And I walk no more among the dead and dying Will; 
I recall the days with pride 
When we battled side by side, 
And the stripes and stars above our heads were flying, Will.

4. And I still remember you, 
Of the ma ny tried and true 
Who slumber now in southern glen and valley Will; 
And some times in a dream Will 
The Old Flag o’er me stream,
While the spirits of the brave around it rally, Will.
