1. Our Flag o’er Richmond’s fated walls,
In triumph waves again;
No Star erased, no stripes effaced,
But free from blot or stain.
As floating on the gentle breeze,
With field of blue unfurl’d;
Its beaming Stars with silv’ry light
Show Vict’ry to the world.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then let the air resound with cheers,
For fair Columbia’s braves;
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!!
Our flag o’er Richmond waves.

2. A nation’s gratitude is due,
To those who have regain’d;
The spot where “Treason” held her courts,
The spot where traitors reign’d.
Where madness seized upon mens’ minds,
And “Freedom’s glorious flag:”
Was torn and trampled and replaced
By foul Secession’s rag.

3. Let heart felt shouts express our joy.
Let cannons loudly boom:
And let them from their iron throats,
Speak forth Secession’s doom.
Fling to the breeze the “Dear Old Flag,”
O’er land and over sea,
And let our motto e’er remain,
To “Death or Victory.”
