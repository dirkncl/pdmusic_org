To R. W. Shields, Esq.
"When Sherman Marched Down to the Sea" (1865)
Words by Adjutant SAMUEL HAWKINS MARSHALL BYERS
 of the 5th Iowa Cavalry, at Columbia, S.C.
Music composed by Edward Mack, 1826-1882

1.
Our campfires shone bright on the mountains,
  That frown'd on the river below;
While we stood by our guns in the morning,
  And eagerly watched for the foe;
When a horseman rode out of the darkness
  That hung over mountain and tree,
And shouted "Boys! up and be ready,
  For Sherman will march to the sea."

2.
Then cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman
  Went up from each valley and glen,
And the bugles re-echoed the music
  That rose from the lips of the men--
For we knew that the stars in our banners
  More bright in their splendor would be,
And the blessings from Northland would great us
  Whe Sherman march'd down to the sea.

3.
Then forward boys; forward to battle,
  We march'd on our wearysome way,
And we storm'd the wild hills of Resaca,
  God bless those who fell on that day!
Then Kenesaw, dark in its glory
  Frown'd down on the flag of the free
But the East land the West bore our standard
  When Sherman marched down to the sea

4.
Still onward we pressed till our banners
  Swept out from the Atlanta's grim walls,
And the blood of the patriot dampened
  The soil where the traitor's flag falls;
But we paused not to weep for the fallen,
  Who slept by each river and tree,
Yet we twined that a wreath of the laurel,
  And Sherman marched down to the sea,

5.
Proud, proud was our army that morning,
  That stood by the cypress and pine,
Then Sheman said, "Boys you are weary,
  This day fair Savannah is mine!"
Then sang we a song for our chieftain,
  That echoed o'er river and sea.
And the stars on our banners shone brighter,
  When Sherman marched down to the sea.
