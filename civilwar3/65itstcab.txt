1. We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
  Sister, loved ones far away:—
In the South the clouds are breaking,
  Onward rolls the wish’d for day.
O’er the plains, along the bayous,
  Down the Mississippi’s tide,
Rings the joyous shout of vict’ry,
  Of glory, and of pride.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[with overlapping voices]
We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
we are To the loved ones far away;
In the Southland clouds are breaking,
Freemen, hail the glorious day.

2. We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
  We have struggled long and well,
And our noble deeds of valor,
  Every future age shall tell.
Mid privations, and mild dangers,
  We have borne our banner on,
Now for us has come the triumph,
  Now for us the contest won.

3. We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
  Mothers, wives, and children dear;
We are coming, all ye loved ones,
  Draws the welcome hour so near.
We are coming from the Southland,
  Where the fair Magnolias bloom,
Where the orange blossoms smiling,
  Load the breezes with perfume.

4. We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
  To the Northland bright and fair,
Where the music of the churchbells
  Fills today the listening air.
To the homes where loved ones gathered,
  Breathe our name in earnest prayer;
We are coming, yes, we’re coming,
  Shall we meet you, loved ones, there?
