1. Comrade I will guard thy mother,
She shall be my fondest care;
I will be to thee a brother
While thou art an angel there.
Let no sorrows fill thy bosom,
Let me sadness shade thy brow
Let thy spirit calmly slumber
I will come for mother now.

CHORUS 1-3.
Let me sorrows fill thy bosoms,
Let no sadness shade thy brow
Let thy spirit calmly slumber
I will care for mother now.

2. While thy soul is soaring upward,
Through the blue and starry sky,
Cast no look of sadness downward
Calmly with the angels fly,
Counrade brightly wear the laurels
Won so dearly on thy brow
Let thy spirit rest contented
I will care for mother now.

3. Comrade ’neath you weeping willloq
Where the wind its branches waves,
With thy “knapsack” for thy pilllow,
There shall be thy silent grave.
We will calmly sheathe forever
This thy sword, which was thy pride;
For it was thy friend in battle
Let it slumber by thy side.
