1. Down in Pensylvania, 
There is plenty Oil they say— 
Petroleum! Petroleum! 
We must all have some! 
The “oily fever” don’t you see? 
Infects most evry “live yankee.” 
From North, from East and West they come 
For Petroleum Oil!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oil! Oil! Oil! O Petroleum! 
Oil! Oil! Oil! Petroleum!

2. “Pick up traps and come along.” 
We will “pump it” long and strong,
 And fill our barrels to the top, 
Hurry up! don’t stop! 
They say all round where you may go, 
Just give a “tap” and oil will flow— 
Abundance of it may be found 
Under, underground!

3. Speculation’s all the go, 
With rich and poor, both high and low, 
And evrybody’s in a “boil” 
For some Petroleum Oil! 
Love for “gold” will long increase, 
We hear of “raids” and talk of Peace, 
But best of all, it’s worth your while 
To come where “I’ve struck ile.”
