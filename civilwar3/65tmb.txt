1. ’Tis night! the sun has sunk to rest
Beneath the weatern hill,
The stars like thoughtful eyes look down,
And all is calm and still;
The soldier, weary with his march,
Lies sleeping on the ground,
But waking from his dreams he hears
The midnight bugle sound.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Rouse ye, rouse, warriors in your might!
Hark! hear the bugle!
Hark! hear the bugle,
Hear it sound; ’tis the signal for the fight.
Rouse ye! rouse ye, in your might, 
O warriors in your might,
O listen to the bugle,
’Tis the signal for the fight,
O listen to the bugle,
’Tis the signal for the fight.

2. The stillness breaks— the very air
Seems bursting into life,
And warrier’s brave and prancing steeds,
Are marsh’ing for the strife,
By countless thousands, rushing like
Some wild impetuous wave,
In answer to that warning note,
The midnight bugle sound.

3. Tomorrow’s sun shall light the field
Where friend and foe must fall,
Tomorrow evening stars shall weep,
Above the sulphury pall,
While many brave hearts, cold and still,
Lie sleeping on the ground,
Who ne’er again shall wake to hear,
The midnight bugle sound.
