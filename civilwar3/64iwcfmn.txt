1. Comrade I will guard thy mother,
She shall be my fondest care;
I will be to thee a brother,
While thou art an angel there.
Let no sorrows fill thy bosom,
Let no sadness shade thy brow;
Let thy spirit calmly slumber,
I will care for mother now.

CHORUS 1-3.
Let no sorrows fill thy bosom,
Let no sadness shade thy brow;
Let thy spirit calmly slumber,
I will care for mother now.

2. While thy soul is soaring upward,
Thro’ the blue and starry sky,
Cast no look of sadness downward
Calmly with the angels fly.
Comrade, brightly wear the laurels
Won so dearly on thy brow;
Let thy spirit rest contented,
I will care for mother now.

3. Comrade ’neath you weeping willow,
Where the winds its branches wave;
With thy “knapsack” for thy pillow,
These shall be thy silent grave.
We will calmly sheathe forever
This thy sword, which was thy pride;
For it was thy friend in battle,
Let it slumber by thy side.
