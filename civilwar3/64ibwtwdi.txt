1. Our Union, the gift of our fathers!
In wrath roars the tempest above!
The darker and nearer our danger,
The warmer and closer our love;
Tho’ strcken, it never shall perish;
It bends, but not breaks to the blast;
Foes rush on in fury to rend it,
But we will stand true to the last.

CHORUS 1-3.
The battle we then will defend it,
Will fight till the triumph is won!
Till the States form the realm of the Union,
As the sky forms the realm of the sun.

2. Our Union, ordain’d by Jehovah!
Man sets not the fiat aside;
As well cleave the welkin asunder,
As the one mighty system divide;
The grand Mississippi, sounds ever
From pine down to plam the decree,
The spindle, the corn, and the cotton,
One pean shout, Union to thee.

3. Our Union, the lightning of battle
First kindled the flame of its shrine!
The blood and the tears of our people
Have made it forever divine.
In battle we then will defend it,
Will fight till he triumph is won;
Till the States from the realm of the Union,
As the sky forms the realm of the sun.
