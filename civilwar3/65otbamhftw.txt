1. Oh! the Boys are marching home from the war,
From the blood stain’d battle field they come
With their banners ridled through, o’er and o’er;
That our brave Boys are now bringing home,
Let us greet them as warriiors of old,
That to us our dear Liberty gave,
And our grateful hearts to them unfold;
To our Boys, fearless Boys, true and brave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh the boys are marching home from the war,
From the blood stained battle field they come,
So three cheers for the Union forever,
And three more for the boys marching home.

2. Now this sad and wicked conflict is o’er,
And the battles our Boys bravely won;
Let us pray for each dear friend that’s gone
To the vanquish’d, hold malice towards none;
Let peace ever dwell around their homesteads,
And dread war never cause them to roam;
So three cheers for the “Union for ever,”
And three more for the Boys marching home.
