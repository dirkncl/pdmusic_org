1. Home the boys are marching! victory’s banners wave
O’er the monster fallen, o’er the traitor’s grave!
Triumph claims the hour; now all our hearts are one—
Merry chimes are blending with the booming gun.
All the love and honor of a nation great,
For her tried and gallant sons the brave and true await!
Love’d ones sadly weeping through the cheerless night,
See the day return of Freedom’s holy light.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ring the merry bells and shout the song of praise;
Ev’ry star is beaming out with undiminish’d rays,
And the flag of Freedom floats without a stain,
Welcome brave and true to love and home again.

2. Home the boys are marching! home to joy and peace!
Let the shout of battle now and ever cease;
Maidens sweet and lovely scatter flow’rs around,
’Till the wounded hero feels how love can woumd!
While each mother chasps her home returning boy,
And Columbia’s mighty land is flowing o’er with joy!
While our nable chieftains, will be deathless names,
All the nation honors, and forever claims.
