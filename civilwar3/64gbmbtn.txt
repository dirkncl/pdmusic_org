1. Two years ago he marched away,
The war light glittering in his eye;
No terror shook his soul that day
No faltering marked his brief good bye
He promised them to think of me
When e’er he saw the moon’s pale light.
May all good angels hold him free
From harm— God bless my boy to night.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Oh, breeze, that fans my throbbin brow
Oh birds that fade in noiseless flight,
Speed speed and whisper to him now
These words God bless my boy to night.

2. I know not where he marches now,
Perhaps his earthly toil is o’er 
Perhaps on his triumphant brow
The sums of Heaven their brightness pour
But be his lot in Heaven or here
In Heaven to rest or here to fight
May all good angels sweetly cheer
His soul— God bless my boy to night.

3. Could I but kiss his cheek once more
And fold him to this tender heart,
Content I’d be to quit the shore
Of life and from these scenes depart
Oh, breeze, that fans my throbbing brow,
Oh, birds, that fade in noiseless flight
Speed, speed, and whisper to him now
These words— God bless my boy to night.
