1.
Son, the one who bears the banner
Where the guns are crashing loud,
Staggers now, for he is wounded,
And his comrades round him crowd;
Hands are raised to grasp the standard;
But on it he turns his eye,
Murmuring, "Comrades, do not take it,
Let me hold it till I die!"
"Let me hold it till I die!"

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
"I have borne it in the battle,
When we forces our foes to fly.
Do not take it 
From me, comrades,
Let me hold it till I die!
Let me hold it till I die!"

2.
Thus he speaks, that noble hero,
While his lifeblood swiftly flows;
And his comrades gather round him,
Where the battle fiercely glows;
And as weaker grow his accents.
On the flag he turns his eye,
Murmuring, "Do not take it, comrades--
Let me hold it till I die!"
"Let me hold it till I die!"

3.
Now his strength is fast departing,
And his voice is growing weak;
While his hand still holds the flagstaff.
Vainly dies he arrive to speak;
But his listening comrades hear him,
Though his words are like a sigh,
"Comrades, do not take it from me--
Let me hold it till I die!"
"Let me hold it till I die!"
