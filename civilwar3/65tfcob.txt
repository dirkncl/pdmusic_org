"The Faded Coat of Blue, or,
The Nameless Grave" (1865)
Ballad
Words and Music by J. H. McNaughton

1.
My brave lad he sleeps in his faded his coat of blue.
In a lonely grave unknown lies the heart that beat so true;
He sank faint and hungry among the famish'd brave,
And they laid him sad and lonely within a nameless grave!

REFRAIN
No more the bugle calls the weary one,
Rest, noble spirit, in thy grave unknown;
I'll find you, and know youm among the good and true
When a robe of white is giv'en for the faded coat of blue.

CHORUS
No more the bugle calls the weary one,
Rest, noble spirit, in thy grave unknown;
I'll find you, and know youm among the good and true
When a robe of white is giv'en for the faded coat of blue.

2.
He cried "give me water and just a little crumb.
And my mother she will bless you tho' all the years to come;
Oh! tell my sweet sister, so gentle, good, and true,
That I'll meet her up in heav'n in my faded coat of blue."

(REFRAIN)
{CHORUS)

3.
He said "my dear comrades, you cannot take my home,
But you'll mark my grave for mother, she'll find me if she come,
I fear she'll not know me, among the good, and true,
When I meet her up in heav'n in my faded coat of blue."

(REFRAIN)
{CHORUS)

4.
No dear one came nigh him to close his sweet blue eyes,
And no gentle one came by him to give him sweet replies;
No stone marks the sod o'er my bed, so brave, and true,
In his lonely grave hi sleeps in his faded coat of blue."

(REFRAIN)
{CHORUS)
