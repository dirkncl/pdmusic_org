On the 5th of September, 1864, a detail of two hundred and
fifty men of the 127th N. Y. Vols, set out from Morris Island on
a scouting expedition. Four Islands were visited and all were
found to be occupied by pleasant though deserted mansions. The
sight of one of peculiar splendor; suggested the idea of this song,
which was written and composed at the time.

1. Ho boys! can you see thro the thicket
  O’ertopping the grove we behold,
The signs of a home and a palace,
  Whose mem’ries I long to unfold;
See! see! walls and hedges so broken,
  Must long since have lost nursing care,
Alas! has the lord of the mansion,
  The doom of the traitor to share?
     Alas! has the lord of the mansion,
    The doom of the traitor to share?

2. Advance! let us enter that dwelling,
  Not fearing assaults from the foe,
Its secrets tho’ dark and forbidding
  We must with some certainty know;
Hark! hark! mystic sounds seem to greet us,
  As lightly the threshold we tread!
The silence and gloom widely reigning,
  Seem like the dark home of the dead.
    The silence and gloom widely reigning,
    Seem like the dark home of the dead.

3. Here riches, and pleasure, and beauty,
  Have vied the best trophies to gain,
These halls now so silent and lonely
  Oft rang with somw warbles sweet strain;
O! where are the loves and the friendships,
  Which none to this home deign’d to spare,
Alas! has the lord of the mansion
  The doom of the traitor to share?
    Alas! has the lord of the mansion
    The doom of the traitor to share?
