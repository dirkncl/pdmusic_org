1. All hail our new born freedom!
  Thy beacon flashes far;
No more the panting fugitive
  Shall watch the polar star.
Ho, freemen of America!
  Strike for your native land;
The shrine your fathers reared in blood,
  Shall now untarnished stand.

CHORUS 1 and 2.
Ho freemen of America,
  Strike for your native land;
The shrine our fathers reared in blood,
  Shall now untarnished stand.

2. Unuterable glory now
  Comes bursting thro’ the gloom,
Behold our resurrected land
  Stalks forth from slav’ry’s tomb!
Shades of the Patriitic dead,
  Join in the wild refrain;
And freemen’s blood, that shake the dust,
  Shall not be spilled in vain.

3. By noble deeds which they have done,
  Upon the land and sea,
Deep in the nation’s mighty heart,
  Shall they remembered be!
Glad million’s cry, “behold the dawn!
  The dawn of Freedom’s reign!
The sable captive, in his joy,
  Hath rent his bloody chain!”


LAST CHORUS [3]
Hail Freedom’s great defenders—
  Hail Liberty, ye throng!
The stars and stripes our pride, delight,
  Columbia still our song.
