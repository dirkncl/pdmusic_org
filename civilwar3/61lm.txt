1. Love me forever,
  Though my cheek paleth fast,
Though from my lip has pass’d
  Youth’x flush of fever;
Look in my heart and see,
  Summer and light for thee,
Shining so constantly,
  Shining forever.
Love me! Love me!

2. Love me, me only;
  Earth no sweet music hath,
Life’s gentlest, gayest path,
  Rude is and lonely,
Save when I hear thee sing;
  Through all our journeying,
Closer, still closer cling,
  Cling to me only.
Love me! Love me!
