1.
Oh! General Lee, it is no use,
So now you’d better go,
You never can whip our gallant boys
We might have told you so,
So toddle right back to uncle Jeff,
And tell him right away,
That old uncle Sam is bound to fight
Until he wins the day!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
How are you, General Lee? I say;
I fear you must be ill, oh!
Why don’t you take a walk this way,
And we’ll give you a “Pillow!”

2.
When you shall get back to Richmond town,
We’ll tell you what to do,
Tell Davis that we have got a Grant
To put the whole thing through;
And you must tell him you’ve been so drunk
That you could hardly stand,
Because you mixed up our Porter with
Our Meade upon the land!

3.
“Oh! General Lee,” says uncle Sam
“Just pack your trunk for Spain,”
Your traitorous cause is hopeless now,
And can’t revive again.
We’ll Grant that you’ve done all you could do
To tear our old flag down
But proudly the old red, white and blue
Shall float o’er Richmond town!
