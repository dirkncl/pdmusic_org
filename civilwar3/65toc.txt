1. I’m a contraband from de old plantation, 
I think I hab work’d out my own salvation, 
I’s citizen now ob dis glorious nation 

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Freedom! freedom! de old slave is free. 
Den hurrah, den hurrah, I am a slave no longer 
Den away, den away  to de land ob de free.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Den hurrah, den hurrah, I am a slave no longer; 
Then away, then away, to the land ob de free.

2. Long I hab hoes in the field ob cotton
So many de years I’s almost forgotten,
I leave dem behind me day all may be rotten.

3. When dis rebellion was fust beginnin,
I golly it set all darkies a grinnin,
Cause we knowed afore long we all woud be singin.

4. We spend our time now singin an’ playin,
Old massa spends his in swearin an’ prayin,
He’d drink whiskey too, but he can’t without payin.

5. Den farewell de cabin whar I was born in,
Farewell de fields wid de cotton an’ corn in,
’Spec’ we’ll be off for de brake ob de mornin.
