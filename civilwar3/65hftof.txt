"Hurrah for the Old Flag" [22 May 1865]

The melody this song was conceived during those highly exciting 
moments, when the roar of cannon proclaimed the _Fall_of_Richmond_.
The thunder of cannon has died away,— may the song live forever 
on the lips of the American People.

W. Dexter Smith Jr. [1842-1909]

1. Our old flag is waving o’er Sumter again!
Its bright stars are gleaming o’er fortress abd main.
Its broad stripes are floating from rampart and crag;
Our Union forever! Hurrah for the flag!
Oh! wave there in glory, in beauty and pride,
As firm as the shore, and as sure as the tide;
And glory to all of our soldiers and tars
Who fight for the flag of the stripes and the stars!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE] 
Our old flag is waving o’er Sumter again!
Its bright stars are gleaming o’er fortress and main,
Its broad stripes are floating from rampart and crag,
Our Union, forever! Hurrah for the flag!

2. The old flag is waving o’er Sumter again!
The traitor has torn down, our standard in vain,
Once more it is blending its azure and stars—
Its stripes, snowy white and its bloodtinted bars,
The smile of the lily and blush of he rose,
A  beacon to friends and a warning to foes;
Then glory to all of our soldiers and tars
Who bear on the flag of the stripes and the stars!

3. Our old flag is waving o’er Sumter again!
And brave hearts have sworn that it there shall remain,
While earth hath a spot that is dear to the free,
And Union forever our motto shall be;
Then up with the flag that our brave fathers won,
And on with the battle that Freedom began;
Yes! glory to all of our soldiers and tars
Who fight for the flag of the stripes and the stars!
