1. O gentle Peace, before thee stand,
The children of the bleeding land,
A weary, worn, but hopeful band,
Thy blessings, thy blessings to implore;
O let thy dulcet whispers come,
To every heart, to every home,
As erst they came of yore,
As erst they came of yore,
As erst they came of yore.

2. Dim eyes that watch, would seek repose,
Sad hearts that weep, their wounds would close,
While prayers which for our country’s woes,
Are daily, are daily born above,
All turn to thee and fondly crave,
From these protracted ills to save
The land we dearly love,
The land we dearly love,
The land we dearly love.
