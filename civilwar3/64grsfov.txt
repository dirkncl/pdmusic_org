Three Offerings to Thee,
Goddess of Liberty.

  To thee fair Goddess our offerings we bring.
Accept them though humble they be,
  For gladly we trust to thy keeping the flag,
That waves o'er the brave and the free.

1. Come rally again round the Standard of Right,
  For danger now threatens our land,
Come forward brave boys and for liberty fight,
  To save us from tyranny’s hand.
Come fill up the ranks of our Patriots brave,
  And take up the sword for the right,
Come all ye true hearted our Country to save,
  Be ye steady and firm in the fight.

CHORUS 1-3.
Then rally boys, rally, the drum beats to arms,
And our watchword in battle shall be,
The Union, the hope of the brave and the free,
And our banner be crown’d with victory.

2. Now Liberty calls you, the drum beats to arms,
  Vile traitors our land would deform,
Our chieftain has sounded the note of alarm,
  Then hasten to conquer the storm.
Our nation is calling upon her brave sons,
  Go forward and fight in her field,
Go on noble heroes ’till vict’ry is won,
  And the foeman is crushed neath your heel.

3. Go true hearted freemen to battle and strife,
  Rebellion is rife in our land,
Though many a hero shall lay down his life,
  Yet victory will favor your band.
When bloodshed and carnage and terror are o’er,
  And peace shall smile on us again,
We’ll gladly receive our brave soldiers once more,
  Who won glory and honor and fame.
