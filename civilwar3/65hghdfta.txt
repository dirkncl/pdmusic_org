1. My Jimmy’s got home I am ever so glad,
He’s got his discharge from the army.
He behav’d himself well, and he was a brave lad,
So they gave him his discharge from the army.
The boys they all lov’d him, his Capt’n did say
That in battle around him dead rebels did lay,
He fought for his country, and not for the pay,
So he got his discharge from the army.

CHORUS 1-3.
Oh Jimmy my dear, your Mammy’s so glad,
That you’re safely at home from the army,
He’s a dear darling boy and a brave little lad,
And he’s got his discharge from the army.

2. His coat is all tatter’d, his trousers are torn,
But he’s got his discharge from the army.
We’ll give him a bran new suit now he has got home,
And all the brave boys of our army,
Now queet is the style, that the chivalry wear,
When Jeff Davis thought our brave boys he would scare,
And for his wife’s advice not a bit did they care,
He was too good a prize for our army.

3. Now rebellious is o’er and Jeffy got ketch’d,
’Twas done by our boys of the army.
There’s Davis and Co. they ought to be stretch’d
’Twould suit all the boys in our army.
But I’m mightly pleas’d be is done up so well,
Rebellion is crushed the traitors have fell
But what tickles me most is that my Jimmy is well
And he’s got his discharge from the army.
