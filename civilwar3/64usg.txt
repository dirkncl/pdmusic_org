1.
I suppose you heard of the great commander,
He's second to none but Alexander;
CHORUS [sung after each 2nd line of each verse]
Then U.S.G's, the man for me, 
Three cheers for your old Uncle Sam!
[Verse]
He came from the West with the spangled banner,
A mudsill and by his trade a tanner.

[CHORUS sung afer each verse]
Good-bye Chase, you'll lose the race, He can distance Abraham.
U. stands for uncle, U.S. for Uncle Sam,
But U.S.G. It just suits me, or any other man;
He dug a trench at Vicksburg and sure as you're alive;
He'll dig one more, 'Round White-house door in eighteen sixty five.

2.
At Donaldson 'mid the wintry weather,
He gave them a smell of Yankee leather;
There Floyd and Buckner caught a fanning,
Their rebel hides was'nt worth the tanning.

3.
Grant marched his men, worn-out and jaded
To Vicksburg, where he was blockaded;
He dug a canal. (none dare dispute him,)
The river would not rise to suit him.

4.
Around the town Grant did assemble,
The 'butternuts' did quake and tremble,
Then Pemberton's rebs. did surrender
To Grant: the Union's brave defender!

5.
At Chattanooga Bragg did face him,
Little thinking Grant would lace him;
He's packed in the vat-- where Grant will soak him,
There let him lay: may the tan bark choke him!

6.
Here's a health to the pet of the Yankee nation,
The next overseer of Sam's plantation;
Three cheers for Grant and his men together.
And nine: for his sole and upper-leather.
