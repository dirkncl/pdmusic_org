1. ’Tis the Peace Jubilee, sing Hosonna! 
Rejoice, oh, ye freemen, rejoice! 
One country, one people, one banner, 
One national heart, and one voice, 
Now that vict’ry hath crown’d each endeavor, 
And honor’d the flag of the free. 
May our land be united forever, 
Three cheers for the Peace Jubilee!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Send the shout o’er the foam crested ocean, 
To the farthermost isles of the sea, 
For a people, by four years devotion, 
Have earn’d this, their Peace Jubilee.

2. Fair Columbia resplenddent with beauty, 
From their fiery baptism come forth; 
She hath cancelled by do ing her duty, 
The sins of the South and the North, 
The bright stars and stripes in their glory, 
Reveal’d no dark stains to the world, 
For millions of slaves tell the story; 
“The standard of freedom unfurl’d.”

3. ’Tis the Peace Jubilee, let the Nation,
Give thanks, as the voice of one man,
Unto God for our country’s salvation;—
A part of his glorious plan!
Send the shout o’er the foamcrested ocean,
To the farthermost isles of the sea;
For a people, by four years devotion,
Have earned this, their Peace Jubilee!

4. Join our Peace Jubilee, for before us,
A glorious future expands;
A theme in our triumphant chorus;
Our hymn for all nations and lands!
A future when justice unfettered,
Shall rule undisturbed on her throne;
And the masses though poor and unfettered,
May claim freedom’s rights as their own!
