1. I have oft been standing where our brave boys were marching,
  Along their hot and dusty road,
While with thirst and with fever their pale lips were parching
  And their proud forms trembled ’neath their load,
But though they were feeble and footsore and weary,
  They still march’d steadily along,
And their spirits were light and their voices were merry,
  As they marched to the music of their song.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O, while the soldiers go to battle with the foe
  Let the tidings cheer them as they roam,
(cheer them as they roam,)
That want falls lightly and the fire burns brightly,
  In the cottage of the door ones left at home.

2. I have stood on the field where the red tide of battle,
  Was wildly dashing to and fro,
And the deathdealing cannon and fierce musket’s rattle
  Was laying many heroes low,
But the soldier stood firm to the duty before him,
  Nor heeded the cannons deadly boom,
But he thought of the Being who still hovered o’er him,
  And the cottage of the dear ones left at home.

3. I have stood by the cot where the soldiers were lying,
  And ofttimes closed their dying eyes,
And it is not the grave, nor the terror of dying,
  That troubles the soldier when he dies,
But he fears that the world in its chase after pleasure,
  Will not stop to look upon life’s gloom;
And that none but the Master will care for his treasures,
  In the cottage of the dear ones left at home.
