1. Reveille sounds, the days draws near,
The hostile columns marshal fast,
The rally bugles sounding clear,
Awake the soldier with their blast.
Retiring pickests tell the tale
Of heaving masses moving on;
And rising from the misty vale,
Ten thousand gleaming baynets frown.

2. Dear comrades fall on ev’ry side,
Far, far from those they love so well;
And battle’s fiery rushing tide,
Sweeps fiercely thro’ the woody dell
And oh a  pang shoots thro’ my breast,
I’ feet that death hath enter’d there,
Life’s crimson stream is flowing fast;
Oh God of merry hear my pray’r! 

3. My country, oh sustain her cause,
Rebellion’s treason quickly quell;
And in submission to her laws,
May all again in gladness dwell!
The wife, the mother, shield from harm,
Oh guard the children of our love;
Protect with thine Almighty arm,
My dear ones may we meet above.
