1. Great God o’er all to Thee I cry,
Oh listen to my prayer;
Increase my faith, confirm my hope,
And lighten every care.
I from this sinful world would fly
And seek, O Lord, a rest with thee,
I from this sinful world would fly
And seek, O Lord, a rest with thee.
I’m weary, forsaken, well nigh cast down,
Oh Lord! Oh Lord! encourage me,
I’m weary, forsaken, well nigh cast down,
Oh Lord! Oh Lord! encourage me.
Oh Lord! Oh Lord! encourage me.

2. My fragil limbs can illy bear
This still increasing pain
Release my soul from its clay house
That it with thee may reign.
Vain prayer, forgive me that I cry.
In wretchedness O let me die.
Earth is a weary place for such as I
Oh Lord! may I not die?
Earth is a weary place for such as I
Oh Lord! may I not die?
