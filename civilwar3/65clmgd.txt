1. Oh! my comrades lay me gently
’Neath the dark cold ground to rest—
And may summer roses blooming,
Shed their fragrance o’er my breast.
Do not let the tears of sorrow
Trickle down the pallid cheek,
But come nearer, Comrades, listen
To the last words I may speak. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! my Comrades, lay me gently
’Neath the dark, cold ground to rest,
And may summer roses blooming
Shed their fragrance o’er my breast.

2. Tell my mother oh, so softly
That I fell as one should fall,
Who has fought for flag and freedom,
And his country more than all.
Tell her that I prayed to meet her
When her life on earth is o’er
When her smile from earth has faded
On the great and blissful shore.

3. There’s an other I have cherished
All the weary, darkening days,
Oh! her smile is o’er my beaming
With its cheerful heav’nly rays.
Tell her that I ever loved her,
With affection, pure and sweet.
Comrades, lay me down so gently
Fare thee well, till we shall meet.
