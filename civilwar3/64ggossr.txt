1. I am sitting in my cottage,
With a heart so sad and lone,
While the night wind round me whispers
In a bitter wailing tone
Of the days that are departed,
Ah! I was so blithe and gay,
For my lover then was with me,
But now he gone away.

CHORUS 1-3.
O our poor boys now are fighting
Upon Georgia’s burning plain
But the war will soon be over
And we’ll have them home again.
Oh God grant us in thy mercy
All our dear boys home again!

2. O my heart starts wildly beating
When a knock comes at the door,
And I hope it may be Harry,
While I whisper o’er and o’er
Very tender words of greeting,
But alas! tis never he,
It is only some cold stranger
With no loving smile for me.

3. Now the moon is softly beaming,
But how sad its witching light,
For I fear it may be shining
On the battle field to night
And dear Harry may have fallen
Ah! what depths of misery
Should I lose the love of Harry
Oh what would become of me!
