1.
Richmond falls! the War is o'er
Welcome home! to part no more!
Ye who fought with dauntless soul,
Ye who marched to Glory's goal!
Lee surrenders! welcome back!
Hero's of the Potomac!
Hero's of the gory James!
Sherridan, and Ord and Ames!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Lo! the battle Horse returns!
Who the battle's danger spurns!
Shares his Rider's soul sublime,
To War's Music marking time.

2.
Grant and Sherman, Meade and Hays,
Whom we grant the need of praise,
And the Brave of Shenandoah
Welcom home! the War is o'er!
Onward! with cannon's wheel,
Streaming flag and flashing steel.
Thun'dring drum and trilling fife!
Ye who saved the Nation's life!

3.
Heroes from Historic Lands!
Lined your path with proffered hands!
And fond eyes, like clustered stars,
Beaming on the Sons of Mars!
Orpheus' Sons and Daughters stand,
Waiting Lyre and Lute in hand,
Proud to join, in martial song,
With the brave returning throng!

4.
For your Escort, minstrel Girls,
Crown'd with flowers and graced with curls;
Beating time with hand and head,
Pulsing heart and measured tread,
Strewed with flowers your line of march,
Spanned by the Triumphal arch,
Jewelled hands outreaching now,
Garlands for each Hero's brow!

5.
Each shall find as North he roams,
Open Arms and open Homes!
And wherever sunlight darts,
Welcome smiles and grateful hearts,
Hosts have fallen in their bloom,
Sleeping now in trench and tomb,
With their names and deeds enshined,
In each Union Patriot's mind!
