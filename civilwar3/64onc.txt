1. We bless the noble Captain,
Who steered our ship aright!
We bless our brave commander,
Who took her through the fight.
When storms did rage around her.
And wreck was near at hand.
This noble hearted patriot,
Stood firm to take command.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
All honor to the Captain,
Who steers our ship aright!
All honor to the Soldiers,
Who neath our banner fight!

2. What ho there! calls the Captain
Is no one near to save!
Yes, shout a million voices,
Of freemen true and brave;
Then in the glorious New Year,
Our leader spoke again;
Laid low the proud oppressor,
And broke the captive’s chain.

3. Come rally round the standard,
And for your country fight;
Now rally noble heroes!
And battle for the right;
The men come thick around him,
And forth to battle go;
The nation reigns triumphant,
O’er her rebellious foe.
