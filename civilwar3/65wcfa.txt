1. We’re coming Fodder Abrahan, 
From de distant shore, 
We’re coming Fodder Abrahan 
Dis Nation to restore, 
We’re From de East and from de West, 
From ebber odder quarter 
Day got de Nigger on de brain, 
And dats what de matter,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We’re coming Fodder Abrahan, 
Sure as you are born, 
We’re coming Fodder Abrahan, 
Coming in a horn.

2. De Conscript bill passed de house,
From de top, to bottom,
To send us down to Dixie Land,
To Confistieate de Cotton,
We’re coming Fodder Abrahan,
To make de army bigger,
Come white folks behave yourself’s,
And be good, as any Nigger.

3. We’re coming Fodder Abrahan, 
To do, de best we can
To make de Nigger just as good
As any odder man—
Dis rebelion must be crushed,
We’re de boys to do it,
We’re coming Fodder Abrahan,
But I tell you, we cant see it.

4. We’re coming Fodder Abrahan, 
But dont be made a fool,
We’re all a lot of Contrabands,
As stubborn as a Mule.
De kingdom coming, am play’d out,
Wid us som time ago,
You cant fool de Nigger longer,
About de jubilo.
