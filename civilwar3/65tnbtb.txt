1.
'Twas night before the battle,
 The moon was beaming bright,
But death's red storm would rattle
 With morning's early light.
A soldier from his bosom,
 A beauteous portrait drew,
And kissing it he murmured,
 IN LIFE OR DEATH I'M TRUE.
CHORUS
And kissing it he measured,
 In life or death I'm true.

2.
I knew her in her childhood,
 And loved her even then,
We wandered through the wildwood,
 Oh! may we meet again
What ever fate betide me,
 His sword he slowly drew,
I never can forget her,
 In life or death I'm true.
CHORUS
I never can forget her,
 In life or death I'm true.

3.
My home, where birds are singing
 Amidst each summer's bloom,
And green vines, round it clinging,
 My quiet cottage home.
God bless my white-haired father,
 My mild-eyed mother too,
They gave me to my country
 For they are tried and true.
CHORUS
They gave me to my country
 For they are tried and true.

4.
He fought as fight the fearless,
 'Twas often hand to hand,
And when the day was over,
 His name rang through the land
And she who sat in silence,
 Each breath in tremor drew;
But see, He comes a victor,
 All hail! the tried and true.
CHORUS
But see, He comes a victor,
 All hail! the tried and true.
