1. What will you do, love, 
When I am going, 
With white sail flowing, 
The seas beyond? 
What will you do, love 
When waves divide us, 
And friends may chide us, 
For being fond? 
Though waves divide us, 
And friends be chiding, 
In faith abiding 
I’ll still be true, 
And I’ll pray for thee, 
On the stormy ocean 
With deep devotion, 
That’s what I’ll do. 

2. What will you do, love, 
If distant tidings 
Thy fond confidings 
Should undermine? 
And I abiding 
’Neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes 
Were as bright as thine? 
Oh! name it not, 
Tho’ guilt and shame 
Were on thy name, 
I’d still be true. 
But that heart of thine, 
Should another share it, 
I could not bear it, 
What would I do? 

3. What will you do, love, 
When home returning, 
With high hopes burning, 
And wealth for you? 
If my bark that bounded 
O’er foreign foam, 
Should be lost near home! 
Ah! what would you do? 
So thou wert spared, 
I’d bless the morrow, 
In want or sorrow, 
That left me you; 
And I’ll welcome thee 
From the stormy billow, 
This heart thy pillow, 
That’s what I’d do.
