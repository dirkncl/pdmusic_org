1. Hark! the loud reville of the artillery,
  Echoes in answering shouts from the hills;
Rise, comrades, rise, ’tis the matin of victory,
  Freedom’s pure soul now each patriot fills.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Firmly stand for the loud won by that hero band,
  Lo! on the ramparts of freedom their shadows stand,
Forward, brave hearts and free, onward for liberty!
  God and the Union, our watchword shall be.

2. Mark where our banners dance fronting the long advance,
  Strike for that starry flag, sons of the brave;
Shout your loud battlecry, “onward to win or die.”
  Fame builds her throne on the patriot’s grave.

3. On, where the musketry lighten’s to victory!
  On, through the thunder and rain of the balls!
Where our proud standards fly, where men with honor die,
  Blest is the hero that valiantly falls.

4. Strike for our broken laws, strike for our holy cause,
  Strike for the memories of our great dead;
Strike deep, firm heart’s, and stanch, strike like an avalanche,
  Crushing armed infamy under your tread.

5. On! one fierce struggle yet; only the bayonet!
  See! they are broken,— they fly boys, they fly!
They to the sword appeal,— give them enough of steel!
  On, then, for freedom! we win, boys, or die!
