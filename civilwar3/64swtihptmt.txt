Hark! 'tis the battle cry,
Sounding o'er the lea!
Hark! 'tis the cannon's roar,
Booming o'er the sea.
Strike while the iron's hot! out the matter through!
Up with the bonny flag the red, white and blue.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Strike while the iron's hot!
Put the matter through;
Up with the bonny flag
The red, white and blue.

Vicksburg and Gettysburg--

Strike, strike in Freedom's name--
End the matter soon,

They gave un no relief,
At last they tried the Buckey State,
When Morgan came to grief,
With Roserans and Farragut
The bravest of the brave;

And then the Union save.
