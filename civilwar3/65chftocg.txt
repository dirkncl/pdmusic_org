1.
We are breaking up camp, and marching away;
  The war is over at last;
We are all going home to rejoice with our friends,
  And talk o'er the scenes that have passed.

CHORUS
We are coming home again from the old camp ground,
  And the scenes of war and strife.
We are coming home again to the friends we love,
  And the joys of a peaceful life.

2.
We have long been parted from our dear kind friends,
  And the joys of a peaceful home;
We have long been camping in the stranger's land,
  And wishing for the end to come.

(CHORUS)

3.
Our old flag's coming, our brave old flag;
  On many a battle field,
It was torn and tattered by the shot and shell,
  But never would the old flag yield.

(CHORUS)

4.
We are coming home again, but we're not all coming,
  For many have passed away;
We have laid them to rest near the old camp ground,
  And they quietly sleep there to-day.

(CHORUS)
