1. O’er the forest dim shadows are creeping, 
Night spreads its broad robe o’er the land; 
And on guard, while my comrades lie sleeping, 
A lone in the darkness I stand. 
In the distance the campfires are flinging, 
A bright crimson glow on the sky, 
While the night wind is mournfully singing, 
The soldier’s uncouth Lullaby!

[CHORUS]
1.2. All alone while my comrades lie sleeping, 
When hushed is the cannon’s fierce roar 
In the silence and darkness I’m keeping 
My watch on the Rapidan’s shore.

2. Up and down on my lone beat I’m marching, 
In silence and darkness and gloom; 
But while here for the foeman I’m watching, 
My heart wanders back to my home! 
I am thinking of loved ones now sleeping 
In peace, at my home by the sea; 
I am thinking of eyes that are weeping, 
And hearts that are praying for me!

3. Thus we watch thro’ the night, and now morning 
Is streaking the darkness with grey; 
And the wood birds, around by the dawning, 
Are singing a welcome to day! Hark! 
The buglers, the reveille blowing 
Now wake from their slumbers the brave, 
Who, perchange, ere the sunset is glowing, 
May sleep the long sleep of the grave.

[CHORUS]
3. Thus on guard, while their comrades lie sleeping, 
When hushed is the cannon’s fierce roar 
Some brave hearts thro’ each lone night are keeping 
Their watch on the Rapidan’s shore.
