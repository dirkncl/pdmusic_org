1. Richmond is our’s, Richmond is our’s,
We hail the news with joy,
The Stars and Stripes upon its walls,
Now floats without annoy;
Up thro’ the lips we’ll shout huzzah,
Up from our hearts on high,
We’ll raise our humble voices all,
Will echos thro’ the sky.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Richmond is our’s, Richmond is our’s,
Glory to God on high,
Ten thousamd thanks to our brave boys,
That made the Rebels fly.

2. Glory to Grant, Glory to Grant,
To Sheridan and all,
Who fought so bravely for our Flag,
And caus’d Richmond to fall;
And there is Sherman with his host,
Proclaiming Liberty,
To all enslav’d, both black and white,
In the land of slavery.

3. Fling to the breeze our Stars and Stripes,
Let all our people rally,
And shouts of joy arise on high,
From ev’ry hill and valley;
Then shall sweet peace its blessings bring,
Once more united stand,
And heav’n will show’r its blessings o’er,
Our once more happy land.

4. Returning Rebels we’ll receive,
And welcome home again,
The fatted calf will feast with them,
That they may long remain,
Let’s all unite in shouts of joy,
Let’s make the cannon roar;
That we’re again united all,
And one, from shore to shore.
