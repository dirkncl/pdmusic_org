1. There are bonds of all sorts to this world of ours. 
Fetters of friendship, and ties of flowers, 
And true lover’s knots I wean, 
The boy, and the girl are bound by a kiss, 
But there’s never a bond old friend, like this. 
We have drunk from the same cante.en. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The same canteen, my soldier friend, 
The same canteen. 
There’s never a bond, old friend, like this, 
We have drank from the same canteen.

2. It was sometimes water, and sometimes milk. 
Sometimes applejack fine as milk. 
But whatever the tipple has been. 
We shar’d it together, in bane or bliss, 
And I warn to you friend, when I think of this. 
We have drunk from the same canteen. 

3. The rich and the great sit down to dine. 
And quaff to each other in sparkling wine. 
From glasses of crystal, and green. 
But I guess in their golden potations they miss 
The warmth of regard, to be found in this. 
We have drunk from the same canteen. 

4. We’ve shared our blankets, and tent together. 
And marched, and fought, in all kinds of weather, 
And hungry, and full, we’re been. 
Had days of battle, and days of rest. 
But this mem’ry I cling to, and love the best. 
We have drunk from the same canteen. 

5. For when wounded I lay on the outer slope, 
With my blood flowing fast, 
And but little hope, 
On which my faint spirit might lean. 
O! then I remember, you crawl’d to my side; 
And bleeding so fast, it seem’d both must have died. 
We drunk from the same canteen.
