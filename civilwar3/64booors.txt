1. O blissful days of childhood bright,
Its fancies and its happy dreams;
My mem’ry clothes them all in light,
’Till youth an earthly heaven seems;
O how my yearning spirit cries,
Bring back each youthful hope and dream!
And back to where I rambled flies,
To Old Oak Orchard’s rippling stream.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
O take me back! my spirit cries,
To scenes my heart doth dearly prize
And let me as in childhood dream
By Old Oak Orchard’s rippling stream.

2. Those scenes how plainly pictured are,
Within my heart engraved they lie;
And ever shall be treasured there,
Till fades the light of memory;
For things we loved in childhood’s day,
Will yet in manhood cherished seem.
O I would love again to stray,
By Old Oak Orchard’s rippling stream.

3. Roll on bright stream would that I roved,
Through pleasant fields and forests too;
Would that the things I dearest loved,
Might now my eyes in rapture view;
But I am gone tho’rt left behind,
Afar from thee things darkened seem.
Yet pictured still within my mind,
Art thou Oak Orchard’s rippling stream.
