1. What will we do when the war breaks the country up
And scatters the darkies all a round
That was the question when he war it first began
But now the answer has been found,
We will work for Uncle Sam, we will do the best we can,
We bless Old Abe for all that he has done,
We have help’d to save the flag
Pull down the traitor rag,
But now our work is almost done
Then what are we poor niggers guan to do?

2. Niggers wouldn’t fight so the papers all have told us,
But I guess as how we’ve proved ourselves true blue
We were massacred at Pillow but we made it up at Richmond:
We were there to see Old Lee surrender too;
And now this war is over we don’t want to live in clover
All we want’s a chance to earn our daily bread
Give us but the word to do
And we soon will show to you
When a nigger won’t be drove he can be led
And you’ll see what the niggers then can do.

3. This war has been a mighty institution for us niggers
It gave us a chance to show we can do
The good work has begun if they only will keep at it
The nigga’s will be faithful and be true
We have proved that we can fight
Let us learn to read and write
We doesent want to hold no place of trust
You have freed us from our pen
All we want is to be men
I am sure that what we ask for is but just
And the nigga then will be a happy man.
