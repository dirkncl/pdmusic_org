1. Oh Sherman the brave, with his army array’d
In the colors of justice and right,
Has dared to intrude on rebellion’s false ground,
And put the fierce traitors to flight.
Unmindful of hardships, elated with hope,
At the prospect of glorious renown,
Our soldiers pressed on at the dawn of the day,
And soon was the great battle won.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then hail to brave Sherman so noble and true,
  Let all sound his praises afar,
He’s past thro’ the conflict unharmed by the foe,
  We’ll welcome our nations bright star.

2. And still step by step, he right onward doth press,
And yet foot by foot doth restore,
The dark tainted land, which by treason’s foul hand,
From the Union was cruelly torn;
Till on Sumter’s proud height with courage and might,
In triumph again he doth wave
Our glorious flag which just four years ago,
Was trailed in the dust of the slave.

3. Then cheer for brave Sherman, defender of right,
Who led forth our patriot band,
He’s won the bright laurels; his glory shines forth;
Let all sound his praise through the land.
Yet here ’twill not end— when long years have roll’d on
And low in the dust he doth lie
Will the mem’ry of him, “Gen’ral Sherman the brave,”
In the people’s proud hearts never die.
