1. Legions of loyal hearts
Who battle for the free
Ere in Love’s Chain the last link parts
Hear us for Liberty,
Behold! the Stars and Stripe
The symbol ye defend
And how the touch of treachery wars
Union it cannot mend.

CHORUS 1-3.
Fight then for this our Union.
Fight for our banner free.
Fight for the love ye hear us.
Fight for our Libberty.

2. Legion of trusty braves,
Ye battle for our homes,
Our little ones our father’s graves,
Our hearth and temple domes;
Our Union and our name,
Champions of Liberty,
Ye Battle that your sons may claim
Their birth right to be free.

3. Legion of trusty braves,
If in our cause ye die,
Be ours to consecrate your graves
To all posterity;
And when in future years
Our sons ask how ye won,
We will reply with pride through tears
Heaven helps the brave my son.
