1. The world it revolves on its own axletree,
Once in twentyfour hours, says G. O. Grafee;
The axle got hot and the world stopt awhile
And the people have all gone to “boring for ile.” 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Never strike ile! Never strike ile!
People get loony: run mad for awhile,
They’ll bore thro’ to China, before they strike ile!

2. There’s lawyers and doctors, and men of all grades,
Men that live by their wits, and men that have trades;
Thro’ old Pennsylvania they’re trudg’d many mile,
With their forty foot anger, they’ry going   to “strike ile!” 

3. Maxmillian in Mexico, has a hard time,
His pockets are empty, he’s not worth a dime;
There’s no blood in turnips: he’ll not make a pile,
If he lives till he dies, he will never “strike ile!”

4. John Bull in his dotage has smelled a big rat,
He’d rather meet Satan, than one democrat;
There’s a doctrine called Monroe will stir up his bile,
He may run the blockade, but he’ll never “strike ile!”

5. Napoleon the little has lately grown thin,
He’s troubled with nightmare and “Duke Dr. Gwin;”
We’ve a small bill against him: Abe’s got it on file!
Then to balance his leger— he’ll have to “strike ile!”

6. Jeff Davis in Richmond don’t get along well;
“His Southern Confederacy’s nought but a shell;”
Let him brag and eat fire in true Southern style,
He may dig his “last ditch—” but he’ll never “strike ile!”
