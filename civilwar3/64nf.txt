1.
O Nancy Fat she was a gal,
Fair and tall and slender,
The fairest gal I ever saw,
In all the female gender;
A lovely foot I know she had,
Into a boot to thrust,
Her ankles small were made for use,
To keep from it the dust.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O Nancy Fat,
What are you at,
I love you as no other,
O Nancy Fat get out of that,
With sweetness my you'll smother.

2.
O Nancy Fat she had a mouth,
I cannot now describe it,
It open'd like a safety valve,
When she wish'd to divide it;
And well I know she had a nose,
And ev'rybody knows it.
The end of it just looks as if
The Brandy bottle froze it.
