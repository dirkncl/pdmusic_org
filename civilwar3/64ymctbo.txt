1.
Yes, my child, the battle's over,
And the bloody work is done;
Mother's heart is made to suffer
Tho' the dreadful day was won!
Father lost his life in battle,
Fighting for the Flag he died;
Never more he'll hear the prattle
Of his darling, by my side.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Yes, my child, the battle's over,
And the bloody work is done,
Mother's heart is made to suffer,
Tho' the dreadful day was won.

2.
How he brav'd the conon's thunder,
Fearless, fighting in the Van!
How the solid ranks went under!
How the blood in torrents ran!
Long that day will live in story;
Never will its lustre wane,
Sad our hearts, midst all the glory,
Father was among the slain.
