1. 
Know each other blessed comfort, 
When this mortal life is o’er, 
We shall know our friends departed, 
Kindred spirits gone before, 
In our holy thrill of transport 
They will be the first to share, 
First to bid us kindly welcome, 
We shall know each other there.

CHORUS
We shall know each other there,  
We shall know each other there, 
We shall meet beyond the river, 
We shall know each other there. 

2. 
Know each other who will question 
Truth so grateful to the heart. 
When its cords are torn and bleeding, 
When its earthly hopes depart, 
Christian love how pure and sacred 
Who the parting scene could bear. 
Did not mercy whisper gently, 
We shall know each other there?

3. 
Sweet the moments when we gather 
In the house of God to pray, 
Precious tears are those we mingle, 
How they cheer us on our way, 
Thro’ the glass of Faith directed 
To our Father’s mansion fair 
Comes the golden light of promise 
We shall know each other there.
