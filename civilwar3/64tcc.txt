1. There is a band of Copperhead snakes, 
Crawling along the northern lakes, 
Ev’ry one has got the shakes. 
Oh, see ’em crawling.

TRIO [STB, sung after each verse]
There is a band of Copperhead snakes, 
Crawling along the northern lakes, 
Ev’ry one has got the shakes. 
Oh, see ’em crawling.

2. There is a snake call’d “Little Mae!” 
Throwing himself upon his back, 
Ev’ry time he takes a tack. 
Oh, see him crawling.

3. the snakes are fill’d with fear and woe, 
Up salt river they’re bound to go, 
Satan has got them all in tow. 
Oh, see ’em crawling.

4. The snakes will all be buried this Fall, 
Abe is bruising them with his maul, 
Each one in to his hole will crawl. 
Oh, see ’em crawling.
