1. We are marching to the music of
  Our Union once again,
Our noble flag once more shall float,
  O’er all the land and main.
And now this war is over,
  Our Gallant sons of Mars,
Will rest upon their laurels
  Beneath the Stripes and Stars.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Then all join in the chorus,
  With glad and joyous tones,
And bless the men who fought for us,
  To save our hearths and homes.

2. Now see the gallant heroes,
  They march in grand array,
How wearied but how proud they look
  Returning from the fray.
They’ve bravely done their duty
  And now returning home,
We’ll all turn out to welcome them,
  With glad and joyous tone.

3. See mothers, brothers, sisters, how
  They rush into the ranks,
They recognise their loved ones,
  How heartfelt are their thanks.
But some they stand aloof and weep
  They think of those thats gone,
Their thoughts return in sorrow,
  To the vacant chair at home.

4. Now when at night you gather round
  Your cheerful fireside,
Think kindly of the soldier
  Who for country fought and dies.
Perhaps he too had loved ones,
  And left them all behind;
To the soldiers’ wives and orphans
  Be generous, true and kind.
