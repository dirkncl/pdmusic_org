1. Minnie Minton, in the shadow, 
I have waited here alone, 
On the battle’s gory meadow 
Which the scythe of death hath mown, 
I have listened for your coming 
Till the dreary dawn of day, 
But I only hear the drumming 
As the armies march away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O Minnie, dear Minnie, 
I have heard the angels warning, 
I have seen the gold en shore; 
I’ll meet you in the morning, 
Where the shadows come no more, 
Never more, never more.

2. Minnie Minton, I am wounded,
And I know that I must die;
By a stranger host surrounded,
And no loved one kneeling nigh;
And I fain would hear you whisper
In the twilight cold and gray,
But I only hear the tramping
As the armies march away.

3. Minnie Minton, I am weary
And I long to reach my goal;
Yet the billows of Old Erie
Blew upon my mem’ry roll;
And I pause to hear you singing
By the waters of the Bay
But I only hear the bugles
As the Armies march away.

4. Minnie Minton, I’ve been dreaming
Of those moments gone before,
Ere I say the sabres gleaming
On the fields of death and gore;
And I thought that you were bending
O’er the turf whereon I lay,
But I wake to see the banners
As the armies march away.

5. Minnie Minton, I am dying;
As the world recedes from view,
I can see the Old Flag flying
O’er the rebel rag of blue;
I behold the Heroes saintly,
Who have fallen in the fray
And their bugles warble faintly
As they beckon me away.
