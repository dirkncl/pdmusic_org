[NOTE.-- The colonel in one of our regiments thus concludes a letter 
written to the family of a noble soldier who was killed in battle: 
"You will always have these cheering words to console you-- 'He was 
not afraid to die.'"]


1. Like a true and faithful soldier
  He obeyed our country’s call;
Vowing to protect its banner,
  Or in battle proudly fall:
Noble, cheerful, brave and fearless,
  When most needed, ever nigh,
Always living as a Christian,
  “He was not afraid to die.”

CHORUS 1-3.
Those who cherished him and loved him
Now are left to weep and sigh;
Yet we have these words to cheer us—
“He was not afraid to die.”

2. To his wounded, sick companions,
  He would tell sweet words of cheer,
Softly bathe their heated foreheads
  ’Till Death’s chariot drew near;
Tell them of a land where ne’er is
  Heard the cruel battlecry;
Comfort them, and tell them they should
  Never be afraid to die.

3. “Little ones” at home will listen
  For his cheerful voice in vain;
But he’s gone! nor tears, nor praying,
  E’er can call him back again.
Those who cherished him and loved him,
  Now are left to weep and sigh;
Yet we have these words to cheer us—
  “He was not afrain to die.”
