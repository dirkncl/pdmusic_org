1. In my prison cell I stand,
Thinking of you Mary Ann,
And the gay old times we’ve had in days before,
When my sock was lined with “tin,”
And I thought it was no sin,
For to jump a bounty every week or more.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Tramp, tramp,  tramp, the guard is coming,
E’en now I hear them at my door.
So good bye my Mary Ann,
You must do the best you can,
For I’ll never jump a bounty any more.

2. Oh the gay old days and nights,
That we passed in fond delights,
When my pockets they were brimming full of cash,
And with oysters, ca,e and wine,
We had such a bully time,
But I’m satisfied in dreaming now of hash.

3. Oh good bye Mary Ann
I am now an altered man,
And I am going away from you I love so well,
Tell the boys to “all look out”
And mind what they’re about,
Or the provost guard will get them “sure as born.”
