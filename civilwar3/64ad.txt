1. Oh! the soldiers here both far and near, they did get quite excited; 
When from their brethren of the South, to war they were invited.
But it was to be, it is to be, it can’t be nothing shorter,
Oh! and if they call upon dis child, I’se bound to die a martyr,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For I belong to the fire Zoozoos, and don’t you think I oughter;
And I’m gone down to Washington to fight for Abraham’s Daughter.

2. I am tired of a city life and I will join the Zoozoos,
I’m gwine to try and make a hit down ’mong the southern foofoos;
But if perchance I should get hit, I’ll show them I’m a tartar;
We are bound to save our Union yet, ’tis all that we are arter.

3. There is one thing more that I would state, before I close my ditty,
’Tis all about the volunteers that’s left our good old city.
They have gone to fight, for the Stars and Stripes— our Union, now or never!
We will give three cheers for the volunteers, and Washington forever.
