This Song is took from the Poem,
It will soon be DRAMATIZED!

       And ORGAN’D!!!!
          And WHISTLED!!!!!
            And SQUEAKED!!!!!!

1. Folks, I’m a Jarsey notion,
It isn’t any braggin,
My father fit in the Revolution,
He driv a baggidge waggin,
And one fine day he started out
all for to git some fuil.
But kum back badly wounded,
Cos he had been kicked by a Muil.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
“Jes’ so,” “Jes’ so;” 
strange things do come to pass,
Some pesky critter stole from me
a borril o’ apple sass.

2. I courted Patty Bigelow,
But for a friend made tracks,
Or John Ellsley would have been my song
If he hadn’t been old Zack’s.
A Brindil Cow Case I have got;
I’ll win it, for I swow,
A smart young lawrer sure could ride
To Congress on my Cow.

3. I called upon a merchant big,
And on young Ellsley, too;
Ses I, “Whoaoh, you CATTILL, (spoken.)
Why, Mister Winshow— how doo you zoo? (spoken.)
My waggin’s standin’ jest outside,
To a post my mare I tied her,
And I want you temperance cuss to pay
For that cre borril o’ cider,

4. I pried about, an’ I looked around,
But didn’t do nothin’ rash;
I found a pistil, a flask o’ rum, 
And the account of Doctor Cash.
And while I talked about old Si,
And Nobby, my bloomin’ lass,
Some critter from my waggin stole
A borril o’ Apple Sass.

5. “Perhaps,” thinks I, “this Otis Boy,
Who stole a watch and chain,
Did steal my sass;” so off I starts,
And into Court I came,
Got swored right through, and tuk a cheer,
But felt a little Noddy,
For I had three cents worth of clams,
And a glass o’ good rum toddy.

6. “Next witness!” I was called upon
Jes’ for to speak the truth.
Ses I, “Here, Judge, hand me a pen;
I want to pick my tooth!”
I bothered all the law chaps;
They thought I was an ass;
They made but little out o’ me,
Or my Borril o’ apple sass,

MORAL 7. Any feller what ’od steal a watch,
’Ud steal a bortil o’ sass;
It’s main strength with them critters,
No pints o’ morals pass.
Be careful how you let hot rum,
An’ clams together miingle,
And when the Sass Case does come off,
Jes’ call on Solon Shingle!
