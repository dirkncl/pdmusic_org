1. Home from the war, among our friends,
And those we love most dear;
With happy hearts will try to glad
The hours that have been drear.
O, blissful now is our return,
To our old home again.
No more to leave that cherished spot,
For field or battle plain.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Home from the war, among our friends,
And those we love most dear;
With happy hearts will try to glad
The hours that have been drear.

2. Home from the war, where comrades fell,
To save their native land,
As they repelled the daring hosts
Of treason’s treach’rous band;
They died to save the glorious flag
Whose stars were gleaming bright
Around them as they nobly braved
And mingled in the fight.

3. Home from the war, O, once again
Within our peaceful home,
With loving ones around us now.
No more from them to roam.
Sweet peace, at last is our reward,
At home, o’er land and main.
And shouts of joy are ringing forth
All o’er our loved domain.
