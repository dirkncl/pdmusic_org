1. While the gentle zephyr’s breathing,
  And the shades of evening last,
Memry’s busy tides are seething
  O’er the landmarks of the past.
Once again I see those features,
  Brighter than the morning dawn,
Fairest  of all earthly creatures,
  ’Tis my own sweet Carrie Vaughn.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O! I love those charming features,
  Brighter than the morning’s dawn,
Fairest of all earthly creatures
  Is my own sweet Carrie Vaughn.

2. When with manhood’s vig’rous power,
  Firm I trod the path of life,
Woo’d thee, rich in nature’s clover,
  Woo’d and won thee as my wife.
Blest above all earthly mortals,
  Fortune’s light began to dawn,
Heaven ope’d its brightest portals,
  Blessed me with sweet Carrie Vaughn.

3. Years have flown, from youth we sever,
  Age and care their trials bring.
Still around my cottage ever,
  Home perfurmes their sweetness fling.
Eye undimm’d, and every feature,
  Still to me as fresh as morn.
E’er the same angelic creature,
  My own darling Carrie Vaughn.
