  "When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time, 
the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken 
and dishonored fragments of a once-glorious Union; on states 
dissevered, discordant, beligerent; on a land rent with civil 
feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their 
last feeble and lingering glance, rather, behold the gorgeous 
ensign of the republic, now known and honored throughout the 
earth, still full high advanced, its Arms and trophies 
streaming in their original lustre, not a stripe erased or 
polluted, nor a single star absecured beaming for its motto 
no such miserable interrogotatory as _What is all this worth?_
Nor those other words of delusion and folly _Liberty first and 
Union afterwards,_, but everywhere, spread all over in 
Characters of living light, blazing on all its ample folds, 
as they float over the sea and over the land and in every 
wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment dear to 
every true American heart _Liberty & Union, now
and forever, one and inseperable._" 
    Daniel Webster.

1. Freedom to all! let the shout go forth,
  Throughout this vast domain—
Proclaim the glorious tidings now,
  O’er mountain hill and plain—
Unfurl our starry banner,
  And let its blazon be,
The guide, the guide and hope of Nations;—
  Sweet land of Liberty.

CHORUS 1-4.
Liberty and Union for ever
  The watchword of the free,
The beacom light our guide and might
  O’er ev’ry land and sea,
The beacon light our guide and might
  O’er ev’ry land and sea.

2. No despot’s power can harm us
  No traitor’s hand shall dim
One Star on that fair Banner,
  We place our trust in HIM,
The RULER of the Universe,
  The SAVIOR of the World,
When in the cause of Freedom,
  Our Banner is unfurled.

3. The “Constitution and the Laws”
  Sheet anchors of the State
Must be preserved and honored
  To make it truly great;
A Nation’s life— A Nation’s hopes
  Are gathered in one field.
Who know their rights, and knowing dare
  Their sacred trust uphold.

4. Then let us stand united
  And give the world to know
All storms will pass which threaton
  Our rights to overthrow,
From East to West, from North to South—
  Our Country’s Flag shall wave;
The emblem of true liberty,
  And union of the brave.—
