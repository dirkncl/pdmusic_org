1.
Our comrade has fallen,
He's gone to his rest,
Where fierce raged the battle,
Still proudly he bore
The stars and the stripes now
Float over his grave,
His tones in sweet music
Fall soft on the ear.

CHORUS
Tread lightly, speak softly,
He's gone to his grave;
He died for his country,
His country to save.

2.
The flag of our country,
'Mid cannon's deep roar,
Where fierce raged the battle,
Still proudly he bore
The stars and the stripes now
Float over his grave,
He died for his country,
His country to save.

(CHORUS)

3.
Our comrade has fallen,
He's gone to his home,
That bright world of glory,
Where blest spirits roam;
O weep for the fallen!
We'll see him no more,
Till we join the chorus
On Canaan's fair shore.

(CHORUS)
