1. The people of America,
  From Florida to Maine,
Have ever since the war commenced
  Been troubled n the brain.
The Rebels first came like a gust,
  And tore our flag in twain,
Then Shoddy rose in Soldier clothes
  And sat right on the brain.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Shoddy, Shoddy, cunning body,
Whither will you go,
Shoddy, Shoddy, homeless body,
Bound for Mexico.

2. Next came the “Bitters” and the “Pills”,
  To set the stomach “Wright”,
While some would take a “Smile” at “Drake”,
  Like ducks before they fight.
Then came the news to be perused,
  That told of hundreds slain,
A heartless few, saw nothing new,
  But Shoddy on the brain.

3. Our worthy Mayor, would stop and stare,
  To see the lively dirt,
Swept up and down, the busy town,
  By Shoddy’s ruffled skirt,
But very soon, the busy broom,
  Will clean each street, and lane,
Then Shoddy frail, with muddy trail,
  Will never sweep again.

4. When Edgar Poe, saw Mister Crow,
  Perched on his chamber door,
He little thought the bird could talk,
  The sad word— “nevermore.”
That word ’tis said, rings thro’ the head,
  And troubles Shoddy’s brain,
For Uncle Sam, now sees the sham,
  And can’t be caught again.

5. When Traitor Jeff, has lost his breath,
  And Babylon’s fallen down,
When Freeman’s toil, can work the soil,
  Then good bye Shoddy’s throne.
The thing’s a curse, when modest worth,
  Was thought to be insane,
Now peace has brought, the “thing” to nought,
  And drove it from the brain.
