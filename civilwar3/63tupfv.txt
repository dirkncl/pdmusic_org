1. God of our Fathers! to thee we pray,
Who gave this land, and blest our homes;
O turn thine anger now away—
That thy great love may still be known.
God of Battles! hear our prayer;
Though we have sadly gone astray,
Our penitent petitions are,
Grant us thine aid to Victory.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
God of Battles! hear our prayer:
While we lift our hearts to Thee,
Wilt Thou stand before our banner,
And guide us on to Victory.

2. Father we feel thy chast’ning hand,
Our every sin seems drawn with blood;
The firstlings of his flowing land—
Have on the Nation’s altar stood.
Heroic courage! valor, brave!
Again have fought for liberty;
Give us thy strength, for thou canst save
From treason and from tyranny.

3. The mother kneels though all alone,
Her all will fight, till vict’ry’s won;
Grant her petitions to thy throne—
Borne up by every Union Son.
Trusting we lean upon thy breast,
Be Thou our strength, our sword, and shield!
A fire to purge the treason nest;
And a strong tower to the Union field.

4. Along the Banks, of modern time,
We bless Thee, for the vict’ries won;
And bow before thy holy shrine,
“Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.”
Thy strength impart in time of need,
While hearts and hands are raised to thee;
And like an evergrowing Mead,
Grant, us a lasting Victory.
