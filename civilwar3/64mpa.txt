1. 
At the Fancy Hall the other night, 
My Polly Ann and me, 
Were dress’d to death all in our best 
So happy, light and free; 
When Pompey Smash, a color’d moak, 
Came rushing in the hall, 
And swore that none should dance with Poll, 
There at the Fancy Ball.

CHORUS
Now strike up the fiddle, 
And let the banjo ring, 
Then join in the chorus, 
While merrily we sing; 
Let the darkies quarrel, 
And emigrate to France, 
I’m a happy darkey 
Oh! with this breakdown dance.

2. 
My Polly Ann she look’d at me, 
And then she gave a sigh, 
While Pompey Smash he shook his fist 
With vengeance in his eye; 
I kiss’d my hand to Polly Ann, 
The Leader gave a call, 
Away went Pomp, with Polly Ann 
The gayest of them all.

3. 
Soon Pomp and Poll were married, 
Pomp cleaned the gemen clothes 
And Polly shouted Hot corn, where 
The summer breezes blows; 
But now they have retired, and 
You’ll see them here no more, 
’Cause Pompey’s made his for tune 
And has gone to Baltimore.
