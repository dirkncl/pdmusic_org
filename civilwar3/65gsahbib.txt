1. Hail! glorious chief! the country’s pride,
    For victory follows thee;
Thy fame is spreading far and wide,
    Great chieftain of the free!
The bravest army in the world
    Is being led by you,
And Freedom’s banner is unfurl’d
    By bonny Boys in Blue.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
General Sherman, O!
General Sherman, O!
The Boys in Blue with fight for you,
General Sherman, O!
General Sherman, O!
General Sherman, O!
The Boys in Blue with fight for you,
General Sherman, O!

2. On Shiloh’s bloody battle field
    He met old Beauregard,
Who found that Sherman would not yield,
    And he took it very hard;
He’d water his horse in the Tennessee,
    That’s what he said he’d do,
But Billy Sherman got in the way
    With his bonny Boys in Blue.

3. And when the rebels, on Vicksburg’s heights,
    Were all corralled by Grant,
Joe Johnston thought he’d give us fits,
    But Sherman said “You can’t.”
Joe Johnston found there were some things
    That he could never do;
He has to run when Sherman brings
     His bonny Boys in Blue.

4. On Mission Ridge he met the foe,
    With Thomas and with Grant,
And on that glorious field, you know,
    Our banners they did plant.
Old Bragg and all his army fled—
    What else could Braxton do?—
When Grant and Sherman nobly led
    The bonny Boys in Blue.

5. Atlanta next was Sherman’s aim,
    Though Dalton blocked the way;
But flanking was the kind of game
    That Sherman knew would pay.
Joe Johnston found that to retreat
    Was all the way to do;
For it was dangeroud to meet
    The bonny Boys in Blue.

6. From Dalton down to Kennesaw
    Joe Johnston did retreat:
From there he found he must withdraw
    Or meet a sore defeat.
And when within Atlanta’s walls,
    Says Hood, “I'll show you, Joe,
That Sherman soon before me falls,
    And all his Boys in Blue.¨

7. Says Hood, “I’ll try the flanking game;”
    But he didn’t make it pay;
For Thomas brought old Hood to shame,
    While Sherman went his way.
Down through Georgia Sherman went,
    Cut Rebeldom in two,
And in Savannah pitched his tent,
    With all his Boys in Blue.

8. For General Sherman, then, we’ll shout,
    And Charleston next must fall;
The Boys in Blue will clean them out,
    Old Beauregard and all.
This base rebellion soon will end,
    The bottom’s falling through;
Hurrah for General Sherman, then,
    And the bonny Boys in Blue.
