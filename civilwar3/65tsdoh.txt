1. I am dreaming, sadly dreaming
  Of the loved ones far away
Gloomy thoughts do crowd upon me,
  And my heart is sad today.
Fancy’s chain is thrown about me,
  And I’m tbinking of the time
When I left that dear old homestead
  For a distant Southern clime.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I am dreaming, sadly dreaming,
Of the loved ones far away;
And my heart doth yearn for comfort
From the dear loved ones at home.

2. When my whitehair’d aged father,
  With a teardrop in his eye
Took my hand and gently whisper’d.
  God be with thee, boy, “goodby!”
Then my kind and gentle mother
  Press’d one kiss upon my cheek,
And with longing eyes gazed on me
  With a heart too full to speak.

3. But oft other thoughts come o’er me,
  Of a maiden young and fair,
With a brow of sunny whiteness,
  Shaded by soft auburn hair;
Who, upon one moonlight evening,
  ’Neath the towering old oaktree
When the moon was shining brightly,
  Promised to be true to me.

4. Words of hope and love she whispered,
  Bade me by my country stand;
Ne’er to let this land of freedom
  Be despoiled by traitorous hands.
I am dreaming, sadly dreaming,
  As I’m sitting here alone,
And my heart doth yearn for comfort
  From the dear loved ones at home.
