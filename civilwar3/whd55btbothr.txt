1. By the banks of Hudson River, 
Where the robin loved to dwell 
Singing sad and sweet songs ever 
First I loved young Isabel 
Underneath the trailing willow. 
Plighted we our love for eye 
While the music of the billow 
Died in to the night; away. 
  While the music of the billow, 
  Died into  the night away.

2. Whitest blossoms of the meadow
Did I round her forehead twine.
Life seemed but a dream of Heaven,
As I fondly called her mine.
She was fair as valley roses,
Dearer than all words may tell,
But ah! now the green earth closes
O’er the form of Isabel.
  But ah! now the green earth closes
  O’er the form of Isabel.
