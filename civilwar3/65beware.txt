1.
I know a maiden fair to see.
Take care! Take care!
She can both false and friendly be.
Beware! Beware!

[REFRAIN sung afte each verse]
Trust he not, she's fooling thee.
She's fooling thee.
Trust her not she's fooling thee.
She's fooling thee.

2.
She has two eyes so soft and brown.
Take care! Take care!
She gives a side glance and looks down.
Beware! Beware!

3.
And she has hair or golden hue,
Take care! Take care!
And what she says, it is not true.
Beware! Beware!
