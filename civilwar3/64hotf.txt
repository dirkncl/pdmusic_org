1. Surely God himself has risen 
Over all the wakened world; 
Burst the darkness of the prison, 
Into hell the shackels hurled; 
For we hear a mighty rattle 
Fill the valleys and the hills, 
As the freedmen march to battle 
As the God of freedom wills.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Then rally, rally, rally 
round the flag of liberty, 
We are men at last and soldiers, 
we are free, are free, are free.

2. God has said make free your brother, 
As you now yourselves are free; 
Strike for wife and sire and mother, 
And for children on the knee. 
We are worse than Pagan scoffers 
If we fail to do the deed 
That God’s grace so freely offers 
To our people’s trampled seed.

3. God has put the sword and rifle
Into laborhardened hands,
And we dare not stop or trifle
When our God Himself commands.
We have cut our bonds asunder,
As the mower cuts the grain,
And the land shall fill with wonder
Ere they find them on again.

4. In the name of God, who heeds us,
We will crush the tyrant’s power,
And we trust to Him who leads us
In the battle’s bloody hour.
He will take us safely over,
He will heal our wounds with balm,
And the blessed dead He’ll cover
In the hollow of his palm.
