1. Freemen beware, lest in apathy sleeping
   Traitors may vanquish and anarchy come;
E’en now the foe in the red field is reaping,
  Strike now for Liberty, follow the drum.
  Strike now for Liberty, follow the drum.

2. Never in gladness but ever in sorrow
  Must the bright triumphs of great nations come;
War is but dross of the peace of tomorrow,
  Peace must be fought for, so follow the drum.
  Peace must be fought for, so follow the drum.

3. Freemen to arms! for the bright day is dawning;
  Sweet day of Liberty, now may it come;
Darkest the hour that doth come before morning,
  Strike for sweet Liberty, follow the drum.
  Strike for sweet Liberty, follow the drum.

4. Brightly shall Liberty dawn o’er our nation,
  Union and Freedom, our watchword become;
All the bright stars, in one grand constellation;
  Union and Freedom, shall follow the drum.
  Union and Freedom, shall follow the drum.
