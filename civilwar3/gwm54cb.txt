1. The merry Bells at christmas time, 
Resounding thro the air, 
Peal from their tow’r a merry chime 
To drive away our care, 
As swells their pealing note, 
Dilating full and clear, 
Or borne away remote 
They scarcely reach the ear.

2. And often does it hap’ that when 
Those plaintive chimes we hear, 
Of friends forgot we think again, 
And drop the silent tear; 
Such sorrow gives us pleasure, 
Tho’ it be ting’d with pain, 
Such as no earthly treasure, 
Can buy with golden grain.
