1. Oh look away out yonder, 
For de dust am rising high, 
Gen’ral Sherman’s comin’ long 
And Massa’s goin’ to die, 
He’s got some nigger soldiers 
Dat make de rebels run, 
Just hold your breff a little while, 
And see de glorious fun. 
Just hold your breff  a little while, 
And see de glorious fun.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Shout! darkies shout! 
Old Sherman’s on de track, 
He’s knock’d de breff, from poor old Jeff 
And laid him on his back. 
[Last time only]
Whack!

2. When Gen’ral Sherman ribes in town. 
We’ll meet him wid a grin, 
How is you Gen’ral Sherman? 
Glad to see you, pray walk in, 
Old Massa’s in de parlor 
As sick as he can be, 
tell him you’re de doctor man 
Away from Tennessee. 
Just tell him you’re de doctor man, 
Away from Tennessee.

3. The rail roads hab been  torn to smash, 
De Lokies cannot run, 
Old Hood has got his boiler bust 
And dat hab stopt his fun, 
Poor Beauregard lies berry sick, 
Wid rupture and wid gout, 
While Bobby Lee, begins to see 
De game am most play’d out. 
While Bobby Lee begins to see, 
De game am most play’d out.

4. We’ll tore de Gen’ral wid his staff
And let dem take a peep, 
Where Massa’s Cotton lays so snug 
Away down by a creek, 
For confiscation berry good, 
Aldo it’s Contraband, 
’Twill make old massa well again 
And turn him Unnion man. 
’Twill make old Massa well again 
And turn him Union man.
