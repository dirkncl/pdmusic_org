1. Hark! a Nation’s joyous cry!
Glory be to God on high!
For a Nation’s prayer was breath’d,
And the glitt’ring sword is sheathed.
Peace returning from the skies,
Greets again our longing eyes;
Dear Content is in her train,
Love and Joy are ours again.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Peace! Peace! sweet Peace! 
Come fold thy wings,
And soar no more
From Columbiaˆs happy shore,
And soar no more
From Columbia’s happy shore.

2. Springing ’neath her radiant power,
Blooms Forgiveness, blessed flow’r!
Shedding odors pure and sweet
Round the place where Brothers meet.
Pride and Hate, like thorny weeds,
Ling’ring where a Nation bleeds,
Root them from the land with care,
Sow the seeds of Friendship there.

3. Let Humility’s green vine,
Round our homes of freedom twine;
Praises from each heart arise,
For our Union’s glorious prize;
May our starry Banner wave
Gently o’er a Brother’s grave,
While it floats o’er land and sea,
Ensign of the great and free.

4. Brothers, North, South, East and West,
O’er the graves where Brothers rest
Raise once more your Temple fair,
Welcome every nation there;
Ne’er your grateful homage cease,
To your King, the Prince of Peace;
Sing the Angel’s Song again,
Peace on Earth, Good Will to men.
