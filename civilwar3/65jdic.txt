With a fal lal lute tol li de up a dady”

Now we’ll take old Jeff to Wash-ing-ton
To suf-fer his dis-grace.
With a  fal lal lute tal li de up a da dy.

8. And when we get him up there boys
 fal lal lute tal li de o.
And when we get him up there boys
  I’m sure we’ll hang him high
He will dance a-round on noth-ing
In the last ditch he will die.
With a  fal lal lute tal li de up a da dy.
