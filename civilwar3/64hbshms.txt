1. ’Tis years since we last met,
  And we may not meet again;
I have struggled to forget,
  But the struggle was in vain.
For her voice lives on the breeze,
  And her spirit comes at will;
In the midnight on the seas
  Her bright smile haunts me still.
For her voice lives on the breeze,
  And her spirit comes at will;
In the midnight on the seas
  Her bright smile haunts me still.

2. Ar the first sweet dawn of light,
  When I gaze upon the deep,
Her form still greets my sight,
  While the stars their virgils keep;
When I close mine aching eyes
  Sweet dreams my senses fill;
And from sleep when I arise,
  Her bright smile haunts me still.
When I close mine aching eyes
  Sweet dreams my senses fill;
And from sleep when I arise,
  Her bright smile haunts me still.

3. I have smiled ’neath alien skies,
  I have trod the desert path;
I have seen the storm arise
  Like a giant in his wrath:
Every danger I have known,
  That a reckless life can fill;
Yet her presence is not flown,
  Her bright smile haunts me still.
Every danger I have known,
  That a reckless life can fill;
Yet her presence is not flown,
  Her bright smile haunts me still.
