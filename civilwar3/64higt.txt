1. There was a time when if we met,
A friend upon the street,
He talked on common themes the war,
The cold, or else the heat,
And took an int’rest in ones health:
That time has passed away—
Now no one asks us how we do,
But How is gold today.
  Now no one asks us how we do,
  But How is gold today.

2. These words pervade the atmosphere,
At weddings, funerals hall,
No matter where; upon you hear
The anxious question falls,
You go to see the girl you love,
To drive your cares away;
You kiss and then she sweetly says,
Oh! How is gold today
  You kiss and then she sweetly says,
  Oh! How is gold today.

3. If gold is up or gold is down,
What good for me to know?
There is no jingle in my purse,
My funds are status quo;
And I so hate the endless cry,
And long to soar away
To land of peace, where no one asks,
Well, How is gold today.
  To land of peace, where no one asks,
  Well, How is gold today.
