1. The night is dark, and chilling falls the rain,
  The sad wind moans around my prison bars,
No fire, no light, to ease my weary pain,
  I lie and watch the flitting silent stars;
The sentries guard my grating prion door,
  Tho’ to death’s iron gate I now have come,
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within my happy northern home;
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within my happy northern home.

CHORUS 1-3
Sighing and sobing by my prison door,
  I dream of  forms that ne’er to me can come;
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within my happy northern home.

2. Oh, mother dear, when I went forth that day
  To battle with the loyal and the true,
With music sweet and banners floating gay,
  I hoped to pass my life with love and you;
My heart with pride and joy was swelling high,
  To clasp the starry flag I’d die to save,
Now in a traitors prison I must lie,
  Must sleep within a lonely prisoner’s grave.
Now in a traitors prison I must lie,
  Must sleep within a lonely prisoner’s grave.

3. Oh, tell her not whose soul with grief is wrung,
  The anguish deep it gives my broken heart,
From her who fondly to my bosom clung,
  From that dear one ’tis more than death to part;
But say I for my country nobly strove,
  ’Till from the earth I peaceful pass’d away,
From war to climes of bright immortal love,
  To meet her there in Heav’n’s eternal day.
From war to climes of bright immortal love,
  To meet her there in Heav’n’s eternal day.

4. But hark! I hear the cannon’s booming sound,
  The bugles shrill, the herald of the free;
They nearer tread, and I a captive bound
  Oh Father, grant me but my liberty!
The angels open wide my prison door—
  Into Thy arms, blest Savior now I come;
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within sweet Heaven, my happy home.
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within sweet Heaven, my happy home.

CHORUS 4
Sighing and sobing by my prison door,
  I dream of  forms that ne’er to me can come;
Longing to see the dear old flag once more,
  And rest within sweet heav’n my happy home.
