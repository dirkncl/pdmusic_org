been true unto my country"His dying words, being__"Turn me 
over, let me die face to the fioe?"  His last words being 
the same as the great Greek General "Epaninondas"

1. I am wounded, soldiers, dying,
  “Fight on! our cause is just.”
List! the cannon roaring, firing,
  Crushing traitors’ hopes to dust;
Firmly trust your brave commander—
  Press on!  nobly to the last.
*He’ll win “if it takes all summer,”
Be you true— “the die is cast!”

2. I am wounded, soldiers, dying,
  Here upon the battle field,
Soldiers, charging you while dying,
  Your country’s name to shield;
Fight if hope seems to expire.
  Do not falter on the way
North’ern’s! heed not rebel fire,
  Press you on, boys! win the day!”

3. I am wounded, soldiers, dying,
  Press you on and win the day—
Dry your tears, and cease your sighing,
  Do not falter by the way.
Death “Bravehearts” can ne’er appal you.
  Let me hear your battle cry.
Farewell soldiers, and God bless you
  ’Tis glorious thus to die.

4. I am wounded, soldiers, dying,
  Send this word unto my wife
“I’ve been true unto my country”
  “In her cause I yield my life.”
Hark! the drums beat— victr’ys ours!
  Let me ask you ere I go
Comrades “turn me t’wards the traitors!
 Let me die face to the foe?”
