1. Do not grieve for thy dear Mother,
Let thy thoughts be far from care;
There is one who still will guard her—
There is one who hears thy pray’r.
Tho’ dark shadows gather round thee,
And thy pulses cease to thrill,
HE above will ne’er desert her—
He’ll be with thy Mother still:
  HE above will ne’er desert her—
  He’ll be with thy Mother still.

2. Do not think that we’ll forget her,
Comrade of our ev’ry strife;
She to us shall be a Mother,—
We will cling to her through life.
We will comfort her in sorrow,
And while sitting by her side—
We will tell her how you perish’d—
How you like a soldier died:
  We will tell her how you perish’d—
  How you like a soldier died.

3. Raise him gently, gently, brothers
In your arms, for he grows weak;
See how fast his vision falters
And how ashy pale his cheek.
Soon he’ll be in realms of glory
Let us ne’er forget our vows.
Thro’ this life to love and cherish
Her who is our Mother now:
  Thro’ this life to love and cherish
  Her who is our Mother now.
