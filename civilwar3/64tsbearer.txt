1. A shout— a shout for Victoty! 
A cheer from the bloodred field, 
As onward dashed the sorried ranks 
The guns their death knellpealed. 
A youthful soldier spurred along,  
Before the cannon’s mouth. 
Bearing aloft exaltingly, 
The banner of the South!

2. “Dost see the foe outnumbers us?”
A veteran calmly said;
The youthful soldier laughed aloud,
And gaily shook his head.
Then onward rode him to the fray,
Before the cannon’s mouth,
Waving aloft exultingly,
The banner of the South!

4. The morn gazed bright and peacefully
Upon the mighty slain;l
The gallant boy lay on the field,
Ne’er more to fight again.
A ray of light was in his eye,
A smile upon his mouth,
While to his deathchilled breast he clasped,
The banner of the South!
