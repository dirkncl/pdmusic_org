1. Dear mother the battle is over,
We’ve buried our dead where they fell;
That hardest of duties is finish’d,
And now I’ve a sad tale to tell.
Dear mother your heart will be breaking,
With grief for the spirit that’s fled,
Oh, mother, God help you to bear it,
For Willie your darling is dead.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
He will no more hear the sound of battle,
For he’s singing with the angels now,
And flowers immortal are twining,
In beauty around his fair brow.

2. The battle was bloody and fearful,
And bravely he fought with the foe;
We drove them like dust from our pathway,
But many a brave boy lies low;
Where fiercest the strife and the conflict,
I saw him press gallantly on;
He fell as we fired the last volley,
Fell just when the victory was won.

3. “Tell mother I died like a soldier,”
He said as I knelt at his side;
He open’d his eyes for a moment,
Then pressing my hand smil’d and died;
And there with his comrades around him,
We folded his hands on his breast,
And wrapped in the flag be defended.
We laid him forever at rest.
