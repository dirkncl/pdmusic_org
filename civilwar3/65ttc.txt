1. Oh, white folks your attention 
I’se gwine to sing a song. 
And if you will be quiet 
I’ll not detain you long. 
And if you dont believe me 
I’ll give you disright hand. 
Kase I is what de white folks call 
a ’telligent contraband.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Rip rap, flip flap, 
Tumble up and break your back. 
Roo ma do filly ma link 
Glory Hallelujarum, 
Hoop de doo den doo 
Dont yer see der happy time has come, 
When dat glorious proclamation 
has set de darkeis free.

2. I is de happiest darkiee 
Dat ever you did see. 
I’ve been so ever scince I heard 
Dat I was to be free. 
I was born way down in Dixie’s land 
Dey use to call me Sam, 
Bi, Golly! now de white folks say 
I’m a ’telligent con traband.

3. My brudder Gim’s in Cuba 
So de people say 
And I am bound to see him 
So I must haste away. 
And if I meet my brud der 
I’ll take him by de hand 
And tell him dat de white folks say 
I’m a ’telligent contraband.
