1. Now “Uncle Sam” has done his work,
  He’s always wide awake,
He’d better go to Mexica,
  A lettle “Nap” to take;
And let the willy Frenchman see,
  He cannot play his pranks,
Upon our friends the Mexicans
  Nor yet  upon the “Yanks.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O! O! O!
We’re off to Mexico,
And this is our song
As we march along.
How are you Maximillian?

2. We have a doctrine in our land,
  We call it the “Monroe;”
From it Napoleon can tell,
  Just how far he can go;
He has a knack of writing books,
  (Let him to that adhere.)
For though he writes, he cannot play
  The part of Seizer, here.

3. There’s Maximillian who has proved
  Himself a perfect ape,
And let the Frenchman draw him on
  Into a dreadful scrape;
He’d better “pack his traps” and move,
  And that right quickly too;
Or he will find what “Yankee lads,”
  And “Johnny Reb” can do.

4. Though Yanks and Rebs have fought awhile,
  Their quarrel now is done;
And Maximillian will find out,
  That they again are one
And let this maxim prove its truth,
  As homeward he doth rush,
“A bird in hand is always worth
  A couple in the bush.”
