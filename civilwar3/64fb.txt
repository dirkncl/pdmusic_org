1.
We all went down to New Or-leans,
  For Bales, for Bales;
We all went down to New Orleans,
  For Bales, says I;
We all went down to New Orleans
To get a peep behind the scenes,

CHORUS [after each verse]
And we'll all drink stone blind,
John-ny fill up the bowl."

2.
We thought when we got in the "Ring,"
  For Bales, for Bales;
We thought when we got in the "Ring,"
  For Bales, says I;
We thought when we got in the "Ring,"
Green-backs would be a dead sure thing,

3.
The "ring" went up with bagging and rope,
  For Bales, for Bales;
Upon the "Black Hawk" with bagging and rope,
  For Bales, says I;
Went up "Red River" with bagging and rope,
Expecting to make a pile of "soap,"

4.
But Taylor and Smith, with ragged rank,
  For Bales, for Bales;
But Taylor and Smith, with ragged ranks,
  For Bales, says I;
But Taylor and Smith, with ragged ranks,
Burned up the cotton and shipped old Banks,

5.
Our "ring" came back and cursed and swore,
  For Bales, for Bales;
Our "ring" came back and cursed and swore,
  For Bales, says I;
Our "ring" came back and cursed and swore,
For we got not cotton at Grand Encore,

6.
Now let us all give praise and thanks,
  For Bales, for Bales;
Now let us all give praise and thanks,
  For Bales, says I;
Now let us all give praise and thanks
For the victory gained by General Banks,
