1.
Uncle Sam, with Gen’ral Grant,
  And Yankee Doodle Dandy,
Sought and found a wayward boy,
  ’Twas Dixie Doodle Dandy,
Secession proved too rough a track
  For Dixie Doodle Dandy,
So Grant and Sherman led him back,
  To live with Sam and Andy.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dixie Doodle Doodle Doo,
And Yankee Doodle Dandy,
Together live in Washington,
With Uncle Sam and Andy.

2.
He took a stroll in Washington
  With his old friend and brother,
Yankee Doodle was his name,
  In truth he had no other;
Says Yank to Dix you couldn’t win
  On your succession bender,
For Grant and Sherman took you in,
  And made you all surrender.

3.
Yankee Doodle tossed his cap,
  Says Dixie to his brother,
I lost my cap in Dixie’s land,
  And couldn’t get another.
Take mine, says Yank, it’s coming down,
  It’s been as high as thunder,
So let it fall upon your hear,
  While you are standing under.

4.
Now Dixie Doodle wears the cap
  Of Libberty and Union,
And thinks the change becomes him well,
  The gray one for the blue one;
Hand in hand the brothers hear
  The banner of our freedom,
Ever ready for their work,
  When Uncle Sam shall need them.
