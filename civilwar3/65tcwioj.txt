1. The cruel war is over, Jenny,
  And Tom is coming home,
And I’m to be his bride, dear Jenny,
  When Tom, dear Tom comes home;
He bless’d me when he left, dear Jenny,
  And said: “he true dear Kate,
For I can never love you less,
  Tho’ death may be my fate.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The cruel war is over, Jenny,
  And Tom is coming home,
And I’m to be his bride, dear Jenny,
  When Tom, dear, Tom comes home.

2. I had dreams last night, dear Jenny,
  And Tom was home once more;
We sat beneath the moon’s pale light,
  Beside the cottage door!
He kissed me, oh, how sweet, dear Jenny,
  His eyes with love did beam;
I sobbed and sighed when I awoke
  To find it all a dream.

3. I sigh no more, I sob no more,
  For Tom is with me now,
And tenderly he pressed his lips,
  Upon my snowy brow;
He kissed me when he met me, Jenny,
  His arm around my zone,
He vowed if e’er we part again,
  ’Twill be in death alone.

4. The cruel war is over, Jenny,
  And Tom came home last night,
He quickly came to keep his promise
  And make me his own bride;
He led me to the Altar, Jenny,
  Yes, solemn vows we made,
And I am now his bride, dear Jenny,
  His own beloved Kate.
