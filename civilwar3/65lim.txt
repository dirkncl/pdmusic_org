1. Rest chieftain rest, now Columbia is free,
  Rest for thy labors are o’er;
Rest in the silence freemen hath made thee,
  Rest on thy own native shore.
Rest as tthy glory floats over the sea,
  Rest for thy work is well done;
Rest where archangels wait to rereive thee,
  Rest on the soil that thou hast won.

CHORUS 1-2.
Breathe a sad requiem ye millions now free,
  Saviour of Freedom is waiting for thee.
Breathe a sad requiem ye millions now free,
  Saviour of Freedom is waiting for thee,.

2. Rest mobile chieftain, our nation is free,
  Rest on Columbia’s proud shore,
Rest while freemen will ever deplore thee
  Rest with the brave, now no more;
Rest chieftain rest, soon heaven will wake thee,
  Rest where our banner shall wave
Rest where in grace thy shadow reveals thee,
  Rest in the land of the brave.
