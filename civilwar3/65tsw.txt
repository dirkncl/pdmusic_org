1. I’m alone, all alone in this cold hearted world,
For my loved one was slain when the flag he unfurled;
For our country he fell, for our country he died,
And I’ll try not to murmur,
Whate’er may betide.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! how sweet ’tis to die for our country so dear,
But how sad ’tis to part from the one who’s so near,
But I’ll murmur not a word, tho’ it’s hard to bear the rod,
For our country he died in the fear of his God.

2. I’m alone, all alone ’mid the cares of this life,
And my heart almost breaks when I think of the strife,
But I’ll cheerfully bear all the trials that come,
For he suffered and died,
For our dear happy home.

3. I’m alone, all alone when the twilight draws near,
And I hear not the step that was music to my ear,
When the dear little once nestle close to my side,
And I see the lone chair,
By the light of eventide.
