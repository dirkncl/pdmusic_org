1. Mournful! O, tearful! Columbia today!
Sorrow and sadness obscuring the way,
Millions of Freemen all tremulous tell
The tidings that have our loved country befel.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Mournful! O, tearful! Columbia today;
The Chief our our nation has faded away.

2. Thus has a patriot, the good and the great,
The head of the nation our dear Magistrate:
Struck down in life by a murderous hand,
The true martyr’d Chief of our great Union band.

3. Weep! O, Columbia! your tears long will lave
The grave of the fallen, the “honest” and brave.
His mem’ry will live ’till time in no more,
And nations of earth his loss will deplore.
