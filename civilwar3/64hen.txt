1. Thou hazel eyed Nannie, nae lass was mair sprightly,
She tripp.d o’er the lea, just as light as a fawn,
Her saft silken tresses that floated sae lightly,
Reflected the sheen, and the gowd o’ the dawn.

CHORUS (2 times) 1-4.
Dear troth plighted Nannie,
Sae gentle and bonnie,
The lang gat she’s taen,
And I’m left a’ my lane.

2. She sits om tje buygane, beside the auld sheeling,
Like music in dreams comes her low loving sang,
Through jessamine tendrills fu’ kindly is stealing,
The warm yellow light the sweet blossoms amang.

3. I stand on the hillside, below me is wending,
In clear silver light the wee Burn on its way,
The heath scented zephyr up Heav’nward is sending,
The evening’s sweet hymn the dear Mavis’s lay.

4. Ah, wad ye were real, lost sceme o’ glen cannie,
The glint o’ the Burn is a light o’ my brain;
Tis memory only that brings me my Nannie,
The Mavis’s lay and the past’s welcome strain.
