1. The Assassin rode on his fiery steed,
His murd’rous work was done—
In the darksome night with fleeting speed,
Through woods his courser run!
As he hurried away from the scene of death,
On his brow were looks of despair;
Before him! around him! The evening’s breath
Told him God’s vengeance was there!


2. The pale moon beamed as onward he fled,
The stars looked down from on high,
The hills and valleys were crimson red
As blood to the murd’rer's eye!
He shuddered! he trembled! And oft looked around,
And dreary seemed each passing breeze,
And lo! the assassin at ev’ry bound
Saw a vision appear in the trees.


3. Heaven had witnessed! he could not escape!
The assassin’s fate was sealed— 
“Vengeance is mine!” saith God in his might,
As the vision that night revealed.
The assassin rode on with trembling and fear,
And mournfully murmur’d the breeze;
Before him! around him! all vivid and drear,
The vision appeared in the trees.
