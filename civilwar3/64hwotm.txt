1. Deeply falling, round doth gather,
Death’s dark shades about thee now,
We would smooth thy lowly pillow,
We would bathe thy aching brow,
Of thy mother, whom thou speakest,
She no earthly care will need;
For there’s One who reigns above us,
Her from pain and care will shield,

CHORUS 1-3.
Rest, gently, rest,
Sleep in peaceful slumber;
God careth for the weak,
He will watch o’er thy mother.
God careth for the weak,
He will watch o’er thy mother.

2. And now, doubtless she is waiting,
For thy welcome, joyous tread;
Or, perhaps, is kneeling, praying
Choicest blessings on thy head,
She will miss thy faithful watching,
And thy tender, loving care;
But there’s One who will console her,
In the grief she’s called to bear.

3. Faithful son! and noble patriot!
Thou hast won a glorious name,
Fighting in the cause of freedom,
For our flag of worldwide fame.
Thou hast left a lonely mother,
Whom thou fain wouldst shield from fear
Wellremembered, fond words, spoken
Oft will cause a falling tear.

4. Gently wave, thou weeping willow,
Where our hero lowly lies,
Angel forms are hov’ring o’er him,
Soon to bear him to the skies
When the trees their leaves do scater,
And the wind makes mournful sound,
Up in Heaven, thy mother’ll meet thee,
Where all joys fore’er abound.
