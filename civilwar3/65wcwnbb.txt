1.
Why can we not be brothers?
  The battle now is o'er;
We've laid our bruis'd arms on the field
  To take them up no more.
We who have fought you hard and long,
  Now overpower'd stand
As poor defenceless prisoners,
  In our own native land.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
We know that we were rebels,
  And we don't deny the name,
We speak of that which we have done
  With grief, but not with shame.

2.
But we have rights most sacred
  By solemn compact bound,
Seal'd by the blood that freely gush'd,
  From many a ghostly wound.
When Lee gave up his trusty Sword,
  And his men laid down their arms,
It was that they should live at home
  Secure from wars dire harms.

3.
And surely since we're now disarm'd
  We are not to be dreaded,
Our old Chiefs who on many fields
  Our trusty columns headed,
Are cast within an iron grasp
  And manacled with chains,
Perchance 'twixt dreary walls to stay
  As long as life remains.

4.
Oh shame upon the coward band,
  Who in the conflict dire,
Went not to battle for their cause,
  'Mid the ranks of steel and fire,
Yet now since all the fighting's done
  Are hourly heard to cry,
Down with the traitors, hang them all!
  Each rebel dog shall die,

5.
We know that we were rebels,
  We don't deny the name,
We speak of that which we have done,
  With grief, but not with shame;
And we never will acknowledge
  That the blood the South has spilt,
Was shed defending what we deem'd
  A cause of wrong and guilt.

6.
But be perfidious ye who will,
  Renounce your sacred word,
Deny all that men hold dear
  And let your eagle bird,
Perch proudly on your banner,
  And let his motto be;
That which I cannot win be fight,
  I gain by treachery.
