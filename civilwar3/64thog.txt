1.
From the bloody Rappahannock,
 Where in myriads lie!
Those who perished for the nation,
 That it might not die!
Came our glorious patriot army,
 Once again to meet
Traitor hords in shock of battle,
 And their hopes defeat.

CHORUS [sung after verses 1 and 2]
Up! shake off thy slumber,
 Mighty nation, rise!
Marched forth thy hosts for battle
 Under Freedom's skies.

CHORUS [sung after verses 3 thru 6]
Pause! the earth is holy
 Where our heroes lie!
And the winds are ever whisp'ring
 Of their wictory.

2.
And they fought as those fight only
 Who defend the right;
Whom the cause of truth and justice
 Nerves with double might;
'Till the foe, dismayed and beaten
 Were compelled to yield,
With their broken columns flying
 From the bloody field.

3.
And the spot is now immortal
 Where our heroes died,
'Mid the awful roar and carnage
 Of the battle's tide.
Their dear memories in the nation
 Never shall decay;
It shall bear in fond remembrance
 Gettysburg's proud day.

4.
Blessed heroes! Here forever
 Rest ye from your toil.
Now is over, "life's fitful fever,"
 Trouble and turmoil;
In the soil you died defending,
 Take your last, long sleep!
While you loved ones o'er ye bending
 Bitter tears shall weep.

5.
O'er the earth your deeds are sounded,
 To its farthest part;
And your battle-field is bounded
 By a nation's heart!
To the latest generations
 Shall your names go down,
Clothed with Glory's bright creations,
 Honors and renown.

6.
Here shall come to offer incense,
 Braves of every clime;
And your tomb shall be a Mecca
 To the end of time.
Oft in future song and story,
 Shall your deeds be told
With new pride until the heavens
 Be together rolled.
