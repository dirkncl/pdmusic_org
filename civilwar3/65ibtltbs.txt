1. Iti is better to laugh than be sighing,
When we think how life’s moments are flying,
For each sorrow fate ever is bringing,
There.s a pleasure in store for us springing;
Tho’ our joys, like the waves in the sunshine,
Glean awhile, then be lost to the sight.
Yet for each sparkling ray
That so passes away.
Comes another morn brilliant and light.

[Refrain 1-2]
Then ’tis better to laugh than be sighing,
They are wise who resolve to be gay.
When we think how life’s momens are flying,
O enjoy pleasure’s gift while we may.

2. In the world we some beings discover,
Far too frigid for friend or for lover,
Souls unblest and forever repining,
Though good fortune around them be shining;
It were well if such hearts we could banish
To some planet far distant from ours.
They’re the dark spots we trace
On this earthfavor’d space,
They are weeds that choke up the fair flowers.
