1.
My Jamie's on the battle field,
 And oh, I miss my Laddie so,
My puir laze hearts sa fu of pain,
 I wish I had sa let him go.
You'll know him by his curlie hair,
 His beauty e'en so ful of glee,
And if kind fate but spare his life,
 My Jamie will come back to me.

2.
The day my Laddie marched away,
 In Highland plaid of red and green;
He looked so brave and bonny too,
 No ither like him could be seen.
The wint'ry snaws will come and go;
 An summer roses blaw in June;
But come and go, both sun and snaw--
 My Jamie cannot come too soon.

3.
My Jamie's on the battle field,
 Where he has gone to meet the foe;
But now I see his face no more,
 I wish I hadn't let him go!
But hark! the bells are pealing loud,
 And banners flying bright and free;
The battle's fought, the victory's won,
 And Jamie's coming home to me.
