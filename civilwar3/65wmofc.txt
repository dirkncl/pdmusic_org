In Memory or Our Martyr'd President
"We Mourn
Our Fallen Chieftain" (1865)

A nation's heart is throbbing,
  With grief sincere and strong;
Tall tail the bell with dirge like knell
  The sad refrain prolong.

1. We mourn our fallen Chieftain,
  His gloriy shines afar;
A beacon bright on freedom’s height,
  The nation’s Polar star.
Mourn Freeman of America!
  Weep, weep through all the land;
The shrine he sanctified in blood,
  A monument shall stand.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ye spirits of the mighty dead,
Join in the sad refrain;
To consecrate the hallow’d spot,
Where sleeps our martyr’d slain.

2. While joyous bells were pealing,
  And telling Treason’s doom;
His noble spirit took its flight,
  To realms beyond the tomb.
His longing eyes behold the dawn,
  Of Freedom’s endless reign;
Then closed in sleep, in blessed sleep,
  And ne’er shall wake again.

3. A Nation’s heart is throbbing,
  With grief sincere and strong;
Toll, toll the bell with dirge like knewll—
  The sad refrain prolong.
Mourn freeman of America,
  Weep, weep through all the land
The shrine he sanctified in blood
  A monument shall stand.
