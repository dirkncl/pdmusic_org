1. Dear Nora, I’m waiting for thee, 
Oh, let me not tarry in vain, 
But return like the dove to the ark, 
And ease my poor heart of its pain; 
Together we’ll roam thro’ the meadow, 
Where sweetest of flowers excel, 
And breathe forth the language of love, 
And sorrow forever dispel. 
  And breathe forth the language of love, 
  And sorrow forever dispet.

2. The song birds are warbling their lays, 
The valleys resound with their glee, 
And tho’ I am charm’d to the spot, 
’Twas here when I first met with thee; 
I’m waiting for thee dearest Nora, 
In the valley where oft we have met, 
Near the streamlet that flows thro’ the vale. 
Oh! do not your promise forget. 
  Near the streamlet that flows thro’ the vale, 
  Oh, do not your promise forget.
