1. Breathe trumpets, breathe slow notes of saddest wailing,
Sadly responsive peal ye muffled drums
Comrades, with downcast eyes
And banners trailing,
Attend him home,
The youthful warrior comes.

2. Upon his shield, upon his shield returning,
Borne from the field of honor, where he fell.
Glory and Grief together clasped in mourning
His fame, his fate, 
With sobs exulting tell.

2. Wrap round his breast
The flag his breast defended,
His country’s flag
In battle’s front unrolled
For it he died, he died.
On earth forever ended,
His brave young life
Lives in each sacred fold.

3. With proud fond tears,
By tinge of shame untainted,
Bear him and lay him gently in his grave.
Above the hero write:
The young half sainted,
“His country claimed his life,
His life he gave.”
