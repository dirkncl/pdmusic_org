Song and Chorus.
Poetry & Music
by Benjamin Russell Hanby, 1833-1867

    Messrs. Wm. K. Davis, Junius Browne, and A. D. Richardson,
who were captured and held close prisoners, were aided in their
escape by a beautiful young Lady, who at the risk of her life
volunteered to guide them by a dangerous and secluded mountain
path, to a point of safety within reach of the Union lines. To
this “Nameless Heroine” this song is dedicated. “Benisons on her
dead head forever.”

1. Out of the jaws of death, 
Our of the mouth of hell, 
Weary and hungry and fainting and sore, 
Fiends on the track of them, 
Fiends at the back of them, 
Fiends all around but an angel before.

CHORUS 1
Fiends all around but an angel before! 
Blessings be thine loyal maid ever more! 
Fiends all around, but and angel before, 
Blessings be thine loyal maid evermore.

2. Out by the mountain path,
Down through the darksome glen,
Heedless of foes, nor at danger dismayed,
Sharing their doubtful fate,
Daring the tyrant’s hate,
Heart of a lion, though form of a maid;

CHORUS 2
Hail to the angel who goes on before,
Blessings be thine loyal maid evermore.
Hail to the angel who goes on before,
Blessings be thine loyal maid evermore.

3. “Nameless,” for foes may hear,
But by our love for thee,
Soon our bright sabres shall blush with their gore,
Then shall our banners free
Wave maiden over thee,
Then noble girl thou’'llt be nameless no more.

CHORUS 3
Hail to the angel who goes on before,
Blessings be thine loyal maid evermore.
Hail to the angel who goes on before,
Blessings be thine loyal maid evermore.
