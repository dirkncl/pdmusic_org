1. Brothers hasten on to battle,
Leave me here alone to lie
While the cannon roar and rattle
Quickly to the conflict fly
For the angels dwell around me.
They their warches o’er me keep.
Brothers hasten on to battle
While I like a soldier sleep.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Brothers hasten on to battle,
Unto death I’ll calmly bow,
For upon the road to heaven,
I see comrads marching now.

2. Brothers hasten on to battle,
Do not linger here with me
Soon I’ll leave this world forever.
Then my spirit will be free.
Angels bright will waft me upward
From this battle field of glare
To a home where all is gladness
In the starry heavens to share.

3. Brothers hasten on to battle,
Unto death I’ll calmly bow
For upon the road of heaven,
I see comrads marching now.
I am going brothers going
Fare thee well, oh fare thee well.
Brothers hasten on to battle
I shall soon with angels dwell.
