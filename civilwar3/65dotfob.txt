1. Dying on the field of battle!
Dying when my comrades groan,
Lying where the markets rattle,
Lying wounded and alone!
No beloved one to caress me,
On my brow the deathdews stand;
No soft voice to cheer and bless me,
As I near the spirit land,
  As I near the spirit land.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
No beloved one to caress me,
On my brow the deathdews stand;
No soft voice to cheer and bless me,
As I near the spirit land,
As I near the spirit land.

2. Life is sweet, for those who love me;
Wait my coming, wait and pray;
But that world is fair above me,
Angels cheer me on my way.
Soft the starry flag floats o’er me,
Victors shouts are ringing round;
Brave have crossed the flood before me,
Hundreds from this battle ground,
  Hundreds from this battle ground.

3. Now Death clasps my chilling fingers,
And my heartr beats feebly now;
But life’s ebbing pulse yet lingers,
Though the death dew’s on my brow.
Mother! God! my Country! dying—
Oh! the waves roll chill and high!
Is that mother’s sweet voice crying?
Weep not that your boy must die!
  Weep not that your boy must die!
