1. By the campfire’s lonely watch,
By the mountain’s granite side.
Where the brook glides soft and free
I dream of thee! I dream of thee!
When the last farewell was spoken,
When I took the last love token,
Did I think how hard ’twould be
To be sever’d thus from thee!
From thee, from thee,
To be sever’d thus from thee!

2. When the cannon loud is roaring,
When the lifetide red is pouring,
On the shores of Tennessee
I dream of thee! I dream of thee!
When the midnight watch I’m keeping,
Where is heard the sentry’s tread,
Thou art then so sweetly sleeping,
Dreaming blessings on my head!
Thou art dreaming blessings,
Dreaming blessings on my head.
