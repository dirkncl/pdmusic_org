1.
Hear the mournful music swell,
  It's hard times in Dixie!
Hear Rebellion's fu-neral knell,
  Hard times in Dixie.
Ev-ery thing is going wrong;
  Rations short, and faces long,
And the burden of their song;
  Is hard up in Dixie.

CHORUS
Rations high and funds so low!
  Foemen come and Niggers go,
Worst of all the Yankees know
  We're hard up in Dixie.

2.
Grant is close upon their track,
  It's hard times in Dixie!
Southern fire won't turn him back,
  Hard times in Dixie.
With his Heroes, tested well;
  What cares he for shot or shell,
Southern brag, or Southern swell;
  They'er hard up in Dixie.

(CHORUS)

3.
Uncle Abe, don't flinch a bit
  For hard times in Dixie!
Tough as any rail he's split
  Hard up in Dixie!
Holding out his honest hands,
  Welcoming all _loyal_ bands,
Abraham well understands
  They're hard up in Dixie!

(CHORUS)

4.
Butler, with his soldiers true,
  Makes hard times in Dixie!
When he came the rebels knew
  Hard times in Dixie!
Johnny Rebs don't see the fun
  Want begins, and credit's done
White man works and darkey runs.
  They're hard up in Dixie!

(CHORUS)

5.
Beat the drum, and toll the bell
  For hard times in Dixie!
Chant Rebellion's funeral knell
  Hard times in Dixie!
And while over land and sea,
  Floats the banner of the free,
Traitors shall forever be,
  As hard up in Dixie!

(CHORUS)
