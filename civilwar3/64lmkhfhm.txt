1. Let me kiss him for his Mother,
  Let me kiss his dear youthful brow;
I will love him for his Mother,
  And seek her blessing now;
Kind friends have soothed his pillow,
  Have watched his ev’ry care,
Beneath the weeping willow,
  O, lay him gently there.

CHORUS 1-3.
Sleep, dearest, sleep,
  I love you as a brother;
Kind friends around you weep,
  I’ve kissed you for your Mother.

2. Let me kiss him for his Mother,
  What though left a lone stranger here;
She has loved him as none otheer,
  I feel her belssing near.
Though cold that form lies sleeping,
  Seeet angels watch around;
Dear friends are near thee, weeping,
  O, lay him gently down.

3. Let me kiss him for his Mother,
  Or perchance a fond sister dear;
If a father or a brother,
  I know their belssing’s here.
Then kiss him for his Mother,
  ’Twill soothe here afteryear
Farewell, dear stranger, brother,
  Our requiem, our tears.
