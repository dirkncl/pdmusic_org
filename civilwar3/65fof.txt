1.
There’s “Ketchum & Cheatum,”
And “Lure’em & Beatum,”
And “Swindle um” all in a row;
Then “Coax em & Lead ’em,”
And “Leech ’em & Bleed ’em,”
And “Guzzle em Sink em & Co.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! oh!
Oily firms pay, in Pensylvaniia
Jest so.

2.
There’s “Gull em & Skinner,”
And “Gammon & Sinner;”
“R. Askal & Oily & Son.”
With “Sponge um & Fleece um,”
And “Strip em & Grease em,”
And “Take em in Brothers & Run.”

3.
There’s “Watch em & Nab em,”
And “Knock em & Grab em,”
And “Lather  & Shave em well,” too;
There’s “Force em & Tie em,”
And “Pump em & Dry em,”
And “Wheedle & Soap em in view.”

4.
There’s “Pare em & Core em,”
And “Grind em & Bore em,”
And “Pinchum good, Scrape em & Friend,”
With “Done um & Brown um,”
And “Finish & Drown um,”
And thus I might go to the end.
