1. Now comes the dawn of brighter days.
O’er treason’s dreary night;
And waiting millions catch the rays,
Of freedom’s holy light.
Droop not ye weary waiting hearts,
The dawn of Peace is found;
And soon we’ll greet our loved ones home,
Home from the Old Camp ground.

CHORUS 1 and 2 [sung twice after each VERSE]
Yes they’re coming, coming, coming, coming,
coming, coming, coming, coming,
Home from the Old Camp ground.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, they’re coming
[overlapping voices]
Home, home, home, home,
home, home, home, home,

2. Oh lovely peace from thy fair brow,
Hope’s brightest rays expand,
Our hearts are lighted with their glow,
And joy fills all the land.
Now soon shall war’s red hand be stayed,
And hushed each battle sound;
And soon we’ll greet our loved ones home,
Home from the Old Camp ground.

3. Let’s drop a tear for those who fell,
They rest ’neath sacred mounds,
Brave hearts who loved their country well,
Gone from the old camp ground.
Peacefully they rest beneath the sod,
Till the last great trump shall sound;
Brave hearts, brave hearts they’ve reached their home,
Home from the Old Camp ground.

CHORUS 3
Peacefully they sleep through the silent night
Till the last great trump shall sound
And our banners wave o’er the quiet dead
As they sleep ’neath the Old Camp ground.
