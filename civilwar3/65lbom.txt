1. “Live but on moment!”
  Speak but once more!
Speak to the children,
  One word I implore!
O breath but one accent
  To cheer this sad heart
“LIve but one moment”
  E’er we must part!
“LIve but one moment”
  E’er we must part!

2.“Live but one moment!”
  Dearest and best,
Tender companion
  In sadness oppressed;
Let me but hear again
  That voice so dear
“Live but one moment”
  This heart to cheer!
“Live but one moment”
  This heart to cheer!

3. “Live but one mement!”
  O, ’twas too late!
Deathlike and silent,
  The lips of the great.
A  fond wife stood weeping
  In anguish and pain,
For one loving accent to bless her again!
For one loving accent to bless her again!
