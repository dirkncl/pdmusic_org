1. Mid cheers that rend the air:
  Mac’s soldiers now prepare,
In Presidential chair:
  Their gallant chief to bear!
In all his fame they share:
  Red, white and blue they wear:
Disunion to its lair
  To drive is aye their care.

CHORUS 1
They cry hurrah, hurrah for little Mac,
  For he’s the boy to win the Union back,
And sail the ship of state on safer tack
  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for little Mac!

2. That cry the people share:
  And all tbat freemen dare,
To do they daily swear!
  And as Mac’s bridge tbey wear,
Make this their daily care:
  In Presidential chair,
The statesman pure to bear:
  And aye this shout prepare.

CHORUS 2
Hurhah, hurrah, hurrah for little Mac,
  For he’s the boy to win the Union back,
And sail the ship of state on safer tack
  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for little Mac!
