1. Richmond is ours! Richmond is ours! 
Hark! in the jubilant chorus! 
Up, thro’ the lips that no longer repress it, 
Up, from the Heart of the People! God bless it! 
Swelling with loyal emotion, 
Leapeth our joy, like an ocean! 
[CHORUS]
Richmond is ours! Richmond is ours! 
Babylon falls, and her temples and towers 
Crumble to ashes before us!

2. Glory to Grant! Glory to Grant! 
Hark! to the shout of our nation! 
Up, from the Iish Heart, Up from the German, 
Glory to Sheridan! Glory to Sherman! 
Up, from all people’s uniting, 
Freedom’s high loyalty plighting, 
[CHORUS]
Glory to all! Glory to all! 
Heroes who combat, and Martyrs who fall! 
Lift we our joyous ovation!

3. Fling out the Flag! Flash out the Flag! 
Up from each turret and steeple! 
Up, from the cottage, and over the mansion, 
Fling out the symbol of Freedom’s expansion! 
Victory crowneth endeavor! 
Liberty seals us forever! 
[CHORUS]
Fling out the Flag! Flash out the Flag! 
Up from each valley, and our from each crag, 
Borne on the breath of the people!

4. Richmond is ours! Richmond is ours!
Hark! how the welkin is riven!
Hark! to the joy that our Nation convulses,
Timing all hearts to the cannon’s loud pulses;
Voices of heroes ascending,
Voices of martyred once blending;
[CHORUS]]
Richmond is ours! Richmond is ours!
Mingling like watch words on Liberty’s towers,
Freedom rejoiceth in Heaven!
