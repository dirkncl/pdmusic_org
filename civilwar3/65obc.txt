1. Tell me, what shineth still with lustre,
Whilst other objects gloomy seem?
The splendent stars which in a cluster
On our great banner twinkling beam!
’Twas first unfurled and proudly waving
For Independence in the field
When Freemen then, all dangers braving,
Beneath its folds our Union seal’d.
  When Freemen then, all dangers braving,
  Beneath its folds our Union seal’d.

CHORUS 1
’Twas first unfurled, and proudly waving
For Independence in the field
When Freemen then, all dangers braving,
Beneath its folds our Union seal’d.

2. For her they bled, laid life and treasure
Upon our country’s altar down
Could we then yield to impious presure
Their sacred writ and its renown!
No, no this compact bound for ever
And therefore must be kept by us;
We have not right to part our sever
What once our sires united thus!
  We have not right to part our sever
  What once our sires united thus!

CHORUS 2
No, no! this compact bound for ever
And therefore must be kept by us;
We have no right to part or sever
What once our sires united thus!

3. We have become a  mighty nation
By that great Deed and Grace divine;
In our dear flag’s bright constellation
The stars now nearly trebled shine!
Be grateful then to Heaven, brothers!
Light for our liberty a blaze—
Stir up the fire when e’er it smothers,
That in its flames we long may gaze!
  Stir up the fire when e’er it smothers,
  That in its flames we long may gaze!

CHORUS 3
Be grateful then to Heaven, brothers!
Light for our liberty a blaze—
Stir up tje fire, when e’er it smothers,
That in its flames we long may gaze!
