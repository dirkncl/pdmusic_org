1. O I’se a Southern nigger
All the way from Tennessee,
I love the good old Union
Since my massa set me free,
I’se trab’led all the way
But made it rather slow,
I’ll just get up and dance awhile,
I’se chain-light’ning on the toe.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O now the war is over,
I’m gwine to have some fun,
Now the war is over,
I’m gwine to have some fun.
Now the war is over,
I’m gwine to have some fun.
Hang up the knapsack
And lay down the gun.

2. Dis cruel war is over,
I’ll tell you how ’twas done,
We whipped them at Antietam,
If we didn’t at Bull run!
Now they better hold their hush
Case Jeff is Hoop’d at last,
The yankee boys they fetched him,
And I guess they’ll hold him fast!

3. The poor man fell a victim
To de draft as you do know,
De rich man laughed skedaddled;
And said it was no go!
But now dis war am over,
Again I’ll happy be,
Among the fields of yellow corn
In good old Tennessee.
