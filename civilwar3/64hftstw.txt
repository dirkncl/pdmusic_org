1. Hurrah! for the standard that’s waving,
The flag of our Union for me;
Each danger and obstacle braving,
O’er the land of the dauntless and free.
Beneath its blest shadow the fetter
Of slavery ne’er can be known,
Oh tell not of lands that are  better,
There’s none like the land of our own.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

CHORUS 1-2.
Then Hurrah! for the standard that’s waving,
O the flag of our Union for me;
Each danger and obstacle braving,
O’er the land of the dauntless and free,
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

2. The cloud that has lately hung o’er it,
Prosperity’s sunshine shall clear;
Chasing want and affliction before it,
And wealth and content shall appear.
The foul voice of treason hath blighted,
Our hearts and our homes for awhile,
But fear not for all shall be righted,
And peace shall return with a smile.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
