1. The cannon’s roar still loundly sounds,
  The bayonets glisten bright,—
The battle cheer leads thousands on
  To perish in tthe fight,
But he who left us for the cause,
  Long months ago was slain,
And o’er my heart there steals the sound,
  “He will not come again.”

[REFRAIN 1-3]
He will not, He will not, 
He will not come again.

2. Still, still the clashing sabres deal
  Their death strokes to the foe,
And still upon the fatal field
  The blood of heroes flow,—
But he whose heart lies pulseless now
  Beneath rank weeds and rain,
Heeds not the tears that flow, because
 “He will no come again.”

3. His comrades still are in the field.
  He’s missed from there by few;
They soon forget the gallant dead—
  They’ll be forgotten too.
I have the sword he nobly held
  When death his capter came,
Its shining blade repents the sound
 “He will not come again.”
