1.
Ever constant, ever true,
Let the word be, No Surrender;
Boldly dare and gently do!
They shall bring us safely through.
No Surrender! No Surrender!
And though fortune's smiles be few,
Hope is always springing new,
Still inspiring me and you
With a magic, No Surrender!

2.
Nail the colors to the mast,
Shouting gladly, No Surrender!
Troubles near are all but past;
Serve them as you did the last.
No Surrender! No Surrender!
Though the skies be overcast,
And upon the sleety blast,
Disappointments gather fast,
Beat them off with, No Surrender!

3.
Constant and courageous still,
Mind, the word is, No Surrender!
Battle, tho' it be up hill,
Stagger not at seeming ill.
No Surrender! No Surrender!
Hope, and thus your hope fulfil.
There's a way where there's a will,
And the wall all cares to kill,
Is to give them, No Surrender!
