1. Be silent! there cometh on spirit wings sped.
The wail of a nation in grief for the dead;
The strong and the mighty, from glory and light,
Hath waned in his brightness and left us in night:
The proud eagle banners all droopingly wave,
And the wild winds are hushed round the President’s grave.
  And the wild winds are hushed round the President’s grave.

2. A deep brooding sorrow comes over the head!
A moan like the tempest, when summers depart.
A gushing of anguish, unbroken and still.
As tolleth the requiem oe’r valley and hill;
The sun that rose bright oe’r the free and the brave
Now is setting in gloom o’er the President’s grave.
  Now is setting in gloom o’er the President’s grave.

3. Be silent! our father hath laid him to rest,
A hero of battles hath yielded his crest.
A statesman hath fallen,— his counsels are oe’r.
His firmness and wisdom shall guide us no more;
Let cannon boom forth and the banners all wave,
While we mingle our tears o’er the President’s grave,
  While we mingle our tears o’er the President’s grave.
