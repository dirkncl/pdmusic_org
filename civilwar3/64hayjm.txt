"How Are You? John Morgan" (1864)
Comic Song.
A Sequel to "Here's Your Mule"
Composed by C. D. Benson [of Nashville, TN]

1.
A famous Rebel once was caught,
  With sabre bright in hand,
Upon a Mule he never bought,
  But press'd in Abram's land,
The Yankees caught his whole command,
  In the great Ohio State,
And kept the Leader of the band,
  To change for Colnel Streight.

CHORUS
Then raise the shout, the glorious shout,
  John Morgan's caught at last,
Proclaim it loud, the land throughout,
  He's to prison cast.

2.
A felon's cell was then prepared,
  At David Tod's request,
And in Columbus prison shared,
  The convict's shaven crest.
And thus the Rebel chieftain's pride,
  They sought to humble low,
But Southern valor don't subside
  Nor less in prison grow.

(CHORUS)

3.
But prison fare he did not like,
  And sought a time to leave,
And with Greenbacks and pocket knife
  The keepers did deceive,
They say he dug a tunnel 'neath
  Its grated walls so grand,
And from the North he took "french leave"
  Away for Dixie's land.

(CHORUS)

4.
John Morgan's gone like lightning flies,
  Through every State and Town;
Keep watch, and for the famous prize
  Five thousand dollars down.
But he is gone, too late, too late,
  His whereabouts to find,
He's gone call on Colnel Streight
  Way down in Richmond town.

CHORUS [last]
Upon his Mule, He's gone they say
  To Dixie's promised Land,
And at the very distant day
  To lead a new command.
