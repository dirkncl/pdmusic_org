1.
Way down in old Varginni,
I suppose you all do know,
They have tried to host the Union
But they find it is no go,
The yankee boys are starting out
De Union for to sabe,
And we're going down to Washington,
To fight for Uncle Abe.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Rip, Rap, Flip, Flap,
Strap you knapsacks on your back,
For we're a gwine to Washington,
To fight for Uncle Abe. 

2.
There is General Grant at Vicksburg,
Just seen what he has done,
He has taken sixty cannon
And made the Rebels run,
And next he will take Richmond
I'll bet you half a dollar
And if he catches Gen'ral Johnson
Oh wont he make him hol-ler.

3.
The season now is coming,
When the roads begin to dry,
Soon the army of the Potomac
Will make the rebels fly,
For General McClellan he's the man
The Union for to sabe,
O! Hail Columbia's right side up,
And so's your Uncle Abe. 

4.
You may talk, of Southern chivalry
And cotten being king,
But I goes before the war is done
You'll think another thing,
They say that recognition
Will the rebel country sabe,
But Johnny Bull sad Mister France
Are 'fraid of Uncle Abe.
