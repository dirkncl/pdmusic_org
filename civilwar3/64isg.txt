1. And who is thinking of me now
In cot or palet warm
While on my cold and aching brow
Comes down the midnight storm
Who wakes to mind a soldier’s flate
That nightly dangers dare?
What brothers heart is not ingrate?
What sister breathes a prayer?

CHORUS 1-3.
Wake not mother, sweetly sleep
Nor mind the soldier scarred.
God keeps the right;
The wrong should weep.
Sleep mother, I’m standing guard.

2. Ah you! ’tis mother stull unweaned
That minds her grown up boy;
Her baby still tho’ years have seem’d
His brow with grief and joy.
What then tho’ darkness shield the foe
And storms weep down the lea,
It nerves my arm and heart to know
That mother prays for me.

3. I'm standing guard while ’round me sleep
The braves that shield the land:
Then wakeful mother, do not weep,
God holds them in His hand!
And proud of heart and calling they
With honor’s bright award,
Who arm for countrry’s right and say
Sleep mother, I’m standing guard.
