1. How many mothers of our land,
Who hear the beat of drum
Look for the absent soldier boy,
So dearly loved, to come;
She loves him dearer, dearer far,
Than e’er she did before,
And murmurs with a thankful heart.
“I’m glad the war is o’er.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I’m glad, I’m glad the war is o’er,
And our boys are coming home
Who fought who fought for our dear land
And peace, sweet peace has come.

2. The father hears a wellknown step,
A well remembered voice,
And happiness, he cannot speak,
Bids him again rejoice;
The wanderer now has come again,
To leave him never more,
And he can say, with tears of joy,
“I’m glad the war is o’er.”

3. The sister waits, how anxiously!
To wellcome brother home;
The maiden knows that home again.
Her lover soon will come,
We see on ev’ry side such joy,
As we never saw before,
Thank God that ev’ry one can say
“I’m glad the war is o’er.”
