1. Behold our shtouded Banner,
  Hark to the drum’s slow notes;
As at the halfmast flying:
  That Banner sadly floats.
The breath that murder’d Summer,
  Hath laid another low;
Brave BIRNEY ever foremost;
  Where duty bade him go.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Behold Yes our shrouded Banner,
Hark to the drum’s slow motes;
As at the half mast flying:
That Banner sadly floats.

2. Not slain by rebel bullet,
  Amid the battle’s din;
No death amid its carnage:
  Was not reserved for him.
But here among his kindred,
  ’Mid surroundings dear;
When night was fast dispelling:
  And morning’s light was near.

3. Oh! Hero of NewMarket,
  Enshrined with Victory;
In manhood’s glory falling;
  ’Tis hard to part with thee.
But thy Redeemer calleth,
  We cannot bid thee stay;
God giveth an He taketh:
  His mandates we obey.

4. Then rest thee noble Chieftain,
  Thy work was bravely done;
And yet with grief we lay thee:
  In thy lone Woodland home.
Yet as the silver Schuylkill,
  Sweeps by towards the sea;
It’s endless rush shall ever;
  Chant requiem for thee.
