1. Come let us make his pleasant grave,
  Upon this shady shore,
Where the sad river wave on wave,
  Shall grieve forever more;
Oh! long and sweet shall be his dream,
  Lull’d by its soothing flow,
Sigh softly, softly, shining stream,
  Because, because he lov’d you so.

2. Here all the long warm summer days,
  The yellow bees shall come,
Coquetting down the blossomy ways,
  With loud and ringing hum;
While warbling in the sunny trees
  The birds flit to and fro,
Sing sweetly, sweetly, birds and bees,
  Because, because he lov’d you so.

3. Here with their softened cautious tread
  The light feet of the shower,
Shall walk about his grassy bed,
  And cool the sultry hour;
Yet may not wake to smile again
  The eyes which sleep below,
Fall lightly, lightly pleasant rain,
  Because, because he lov’d you so.

4. And when beneath the chilly light,
  That crowns the winter day,
The storms shall fold his grave in white,
  And shut the world away;
Above his sweet untroubled rest,
  Fall soft caressing snow,
Drift tenderly across his breast,
  Because, because he lov’d you so.
