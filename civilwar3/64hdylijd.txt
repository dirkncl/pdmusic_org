1.
Oh, how do you like it as far as you’ve got?
  Jefferson D! Jefferson D!
Are you glad you began it, or d’ye wish you had not?
  Jefferson, Jefferson D!
People say (tho’ of course I don’t know that its so,)
That your spirits are getting decidedly low,
And you’re sick and discouraged, and I don’t know what;
But say tho’ do you like it as far as you’ve got?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Ho! Jefferson D!
Things look rather shaky, now,
’Twixt you and me!

2.
If  I were in your place I’d try foreign air,
  Jefferson D! Jefferson D!
And at once for a short trip to Europe prepare,
  Jefferson, Jefferson D!
But as things are at present I don’t think I’d sail
From Charlston, Savanah, New Orleans or Mobile;
But in order tho’ absent, to retain my command,
I’d just take an oxteam and go round by land.

3.
You can’t think how sorry I was when I heard,
  Jefferson D! Jefferson D!
That your visit to Washington had been defer’d,
  Jefferson, Jefferson D!
I hope that you’ll find it convenient to come,
When Age and the rest of the boys are as home;
But I trust you won’t mind it, they’re such a queer lot,
If they ask you hou you like it as far as you’ve got?
