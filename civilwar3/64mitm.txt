1. McClellan is our joy and pride, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
We’ll stand by him, what e’er betide, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
He is the Gen’ral of our choice, 
Oh, shout for him with ev’ry voice, 
He soon will make our land rejoice, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, shout for him with ev’ry voice, 
He soon will make our land rejoice, 
He soon will make our land rejoice, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!

2. He’ll bring the Union back again, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
And will cement the broken chain, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
Then give the little hero cheers, 
And bid adieu to doubts and fears, 
And be McClellan’s volunteers, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!

3. No matter what his foes may say, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
He’s surely bound to win the day, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
He will enforce the good old laws, 
And help along our holly cause, 
Within the Union, as it was, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!

4. Then raise aloft, our starry flag 
Hurrah! boys, burrah! 
He will bring down the Southern rag, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! 
He will bring peace to us again, 
Will stay the tide on battle-plain, 
Raise one flag o’er our land and main, 
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!
