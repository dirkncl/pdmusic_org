1.
All hail to Ulysses the patriot’s friend,
The hero of battles renowned;
He has won the bright laurel, its garland he wears,
And his fame thro’ the world we will sound.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Yes, hail patriot soldier! we’ll welcome you home,
When strife and rebellion are o’er;
When terror shall cease
And our land be at peace,
And the war shall be heard of no more.
When terror shall cease
And our land be at peace,
And the war shall be heard of no more.

2.
When treason her banner unfurl’d in the land,
To liberty then he was true:
On he warhorse her legions he met in the field,
And defended the Red, White and Blue.

3.
Then hail to Ulysses the noble and brave,
In trial the veteran so true,
Yes, in honor we hail him the champion of right,
And the friend of the Red, White and Blue.
