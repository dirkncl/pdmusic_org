1.
Please to look on my say am I bold,
Ye behold, I've been sold,
And I'm sure when my story I've told,
Badly treated, I've been you will say,
By a chap who was called Thomas James,
Thomas James, was his name,
And I hope I'll ne'er see him again.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Tootle um, tootle um day.
Though he vow'd that he never would leave me,
But I'm sure he meant to deceive me,
Tootle um, tootle um,
Tootle um, tootle um,
Tootle um, tootle um, day.

2.
I first met this chap in the Park,
In the Park, what a lark,
He [--] to make a remark
That is was a very cold day,
To which I replied not to bold
That it was, very cold,
His name and addres then he told.

3.
Says he charming girl name the day,
Only say when the day,
So I spoke up and said, right away
I'll marry you now Thomas James,
But the very next day on the street,
On the street I did meet,
This chap with a girl talking sweet.

4.
Says I Thomas James, this looks queer,
Very queer talking here,
When he turned round and said Wifey dear
Send this crazy woman away.
Then I screamed and said cruel man,
Look at me, if you can,
But he took to his heels and he ran.
