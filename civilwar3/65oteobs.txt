1. On the eve of battle, sister,
I am dreaming of the home
Where I passed a happy childhood
Ere my feet had learned to roam;
Dreaming of the blissful moments
Passing like some vision fair,
Long befor the sounds of battle
Fell upon the peaceful sir.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On the eve of battle, sister,
I am dreaming of the home
Where I passed a happy childhood,
Ere my feet had learned to roam.

2. I am dreaming, sister, dreaming,
Of a sweet and blissful past,
Where no sorrows came to sadden
Days too fair and bright to last;
Of the loved ones, best and dear
Gathered in our cottage home,
Praying for the absent soldier
Who perhaps, will neber come.

3. On the eve of battle, sister,
God alone, my guide and shield,
I am waiting for the conflict
And will sooner die than yield;
I may never more behold you
Never hear your voice so sweet,
If I fall, may gracious heaven
Guard thee, till once more we meet.
