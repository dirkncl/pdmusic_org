1. He’s gone from the strife to the home of the weary; 
They’ve borne him away to his own western bowers, 
Where the bird and the bee and the rose of the prairie 
May remember his grave in the bright summer hours; 
He had lived for a world, and a race bowed in sorrow; 
And a wail for the dead filled the halls of the free, 
But the voice of a world gathered might on the morrow, 
And arose like the sound of the sea.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come forth (Columbia, come forth)
from the dark vale of Edom, 
All red with the gore of the brave,—  
Come forth with thy deep song of Freedom, 
Unmar’d by the moan of a slave. 

2. He sleeps in the vale of his dear native river; 
His deep voice is hushed on its beautiful shore; 
But the bloom of his glory will dwell there forever, 
When kings and their crowns are remembered no more; 
In the ages to come will his memory linger, 
And the light of his councils grow brighter with time; 
And his fame be rekindled  by mercy’s white anger, 
When the world is unstained by a crime.
