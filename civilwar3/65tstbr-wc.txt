1. Tis sweet to be remember’d,
When far away we roam;
And on the stormy billows,
We think of friends at home,
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
By Father, Mother dear;
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
In closing hours of life.

CHORUS 1 [sung twice]
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
By Father, Mother dear,
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
By all both far and near.

2. Tis sweet to be remember’d,
Mids’t turmoil of this life;
While toiling on its pathway,
And mingling in its strife,
While wand’ring o’er earth’s surface,
Or sailing on the sea;
Tis sweet to be remmember’d,
Where ever we may be.

CHORUS 2 [sung twice]
While wand’ring o’er earth’s surface
Or sailing on the Sea,
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
Where ever we may be.

3. Tis sweet to love the absent,
From home, or from our side;
Tis joy to know that pleasure,
And peace with them abide,
And while from them we’re absent,
We’re thought of day by day;
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
By those that’s far away.

CHORUS 3 [sung twice]
And while from them we’er absent
We’ thought of day by day,
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
By those that’s far away.

4. Tis sweet when toils are ended,
And conflict is all done;
With peace in sweetest accents,
Proclaim the vict’ry won,
When hush’d are all our sorrow,
And calm is all our strife;
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
In closing hours of life.

CHORUS 4 [sung twice]
When hush’d are all our sorrows
And calm is all our strife,
Tis sweet to be remember’d,
In closing hours of life.
