1. Dear wife I’m with you once again,
Back from the cruel war I’ve come,
Though I am wounded and in pain,
’Tis very sweet to be at home.
When in our country’s hour of gloom
For help she call’d on ev’ry son.

CHORUS 1
Donn’d I the helmet and the plume,
And I enroll’d myself as one.
Donn’d I the helmet and the plume,
And I enroll’d myself as one, myself as one.

2. When far away from thee dear wife,
Fighting for all we hold most dear,
Freedom and for a nation’s life,
Often my thoughts would bring thee near.
And when the weary day was past
Down on my pallet hard I lay.

CHORUS 2
’Tis then when slumber held me fast,
Back, back to thee in dreams I’d stray.
’Tis then when slumber held me fast,
Back, back to thee in dreams I’d stray, in dreams I’d stray.

3. Now I am with you once again,
Look not upon this maimed form,
Let not the thoughts of it give pain,
While life remains and love is warm.
To my country I have givˆn a limb,
To my wife I bring an unchang’d heart.

CHORUS 3
Tears should not now your bright eyes dim,
For in this world we will not part.
Tears should not now your bright eyes dim,
For in this world we will not part, we will not part.
