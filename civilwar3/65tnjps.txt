(The Words and Music of this Song were selected from a contribution 
of a very large number, that were presented in reply to the offer 
of a Prize of One Hundred Dollars, offered through the columns of 
"Demorest's Monthly Magazine" and other publications. The final 
adjudication of the respective merits of both words and music was 
submitted to a large number of eminent musical and literary critics, 
and the decision was almost unanimous in its confirmation. It is, 
therefore, respectfully submitted to the public as a National 
Jubilee Song.)

1. Fling forth the Nation’s banner
  In its glory on the air!
’Tis the ancient Flag of Freedom,
  Not a star is missing there;
//: Our triumph and redemtion,
  For the people all are free;
And the Jubilee hath sounded—
  Universal Liberty. ://

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Shout! the good time has come,
Our Nation now is free;
Echo the chorus wide,
Proclaim the Jubilee!
Echo the chorus wide,
Proclaim the Jubilee!

2. The Dove of Peace is brooding
  O’er the desolated earth,
And the flowers again are springing
  In our Freedom’s second birth.
//: Ring out the bells of glory,
  Call our noble veteruns home;
From the fields of war and carnage,
  Greet the Heroes as they come. ://

3. Upon the brow of millions
  God hath placed the crown of light,
And the hosts of their oppressors
  He hath ’whelmed in endless night.
//: We’ll shout aloud the triumph
  Through the world, from pole to pole.
Be the boon for all defended
  As the birthright of the soul. ://

4. The starry flag is floating
  In its glory on the air;
’Tis the spotless flag of freedom,
  Not a star is missing there;
//: Eternal truth and justice,
  All mankind exalting see
Shout the universal chorus
  Of our country’s Jubilee. ://
