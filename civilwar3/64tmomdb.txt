1.
Tell me of my darling boy,
 Is he living, is he dead?
For among the 'missing' I
 His dear name this morning read,
Tell me, didst thou see him fall?
 Did'st thou hear his last farewell?
Hast thou not one word of news
 Of my darling boy to tell?

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Tell me of my darling boy,
 Is he living, is he dead?
For among the 'missing' I
 His dear name this morning read.

2.
Nothing of my child they know,
 Whether living, whether dead,
Only that he wounded fell,
 As his men he bravely led,
To the thickest of the fight,
 Where be thousands heroes fell;
Had he been among the "killed,"
 I had felt it 'all is well.'

3.
Did I know he sweetly sleeps,
 From all strife and suffering free,
In his unmarked warrior's grave,
 Though that mound I ne'er should see,
I could cheer my lonely heart,
 Soothe the anguish of my breast,
With the reconciling thought,
 He is happy and at rest.

4.
God of mercy! spare my child,
 Comfort him in his distress;
May he find in Thee a friend,
 Who will comfort him and bless;
Spare him, if it be Thy will,
 Shield him from war's dread alarms,
And restore him once again
 To his widowed mother's arms.

 
And restore him once again
