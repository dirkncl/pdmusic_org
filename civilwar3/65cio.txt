1. Fling out your banner from every spire,
Vict’ry embalms it with immortal fire;
Brighter its stars shine than ever before,
Crowned with the glory which heroes adore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Charleston is our!
Charleston is ours!
Charleston is ours!

2. Hearts throb with gladness and pulses beat fast,
Patriots are firm, and base traitors aghast;
Deep in the dust lies the hope of the foe,
Lifeless and cold as the midwinter snow.

3. God with his wrath hath made right doubly strong—
Justice has triumphed at last over wrong:
Treason liest stretched on the blood mangled plain.
Never to raise its black banner again.

4. Thanks to the soldiers who stood in the van!
Thanks to the strong arm of each gallant man!
Thanks to brave Sherman and Grant who stood true.
First by the rainbow of Red, White, and Blue.
