1. Close his eyes, his work is done,
What to him is friend or foeman;
Rise of moon or set of sun,
Hand of man or kiss of woman.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Lay him low,
Lay him low,
In the clover or the snow,
  What cares he, he cannot know.
Lay him low,
Lay him low.

2. As man may, he fought his fight,
Prov’d his truth by his endeavor,
Let him sleep in solemn right
Sleep forever and forever.

3. Fold him in his country’s stars,
Roll the drum and fire the volley,
What to him are all our wars,
What but death bemocking folly.

4. Leave him to God’s watching eye,
Trust him to the hand that made him,
Mortal love sweeps idly by,
God alone has pow’r to aid him.
