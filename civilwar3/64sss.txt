1. 
Sleep sweetly sleep; the cannons boom, 
Shall never wake thee more. 
No more you’ll heed the battle cry, 
Upon Columbia’s shore, 
When Freedom cried from Sumpter’s walls, 
And blew her battle peal, 
You rallied ’neath the Starry flag, 
With heart as true as steel.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then sweet   ly sleep, O sweetly sleep, 
For hearts must ache and eyes must weep, 
Then sweetly sleep, O sweetly sleep 
While we thy mem’ry sacred keep.

2. 
Your noble spir it passed away, 
A bright and hallowed name 
Pass’d in the battles grand array 
High in the scroll of Fame. 
Ring out the bell with solemn toll, 
With slow and dirgelike knoll, 
Here lies a true and noble soul 
Who for his country fell.

3. 
Braid laurels bright, for him a crown, 
Pure emblem of his love; 
Then lay him kindly, sadly down, 
And plant the Flag above. 
Sleep sweetly, sleep, the cannons boom 
Shall never wake thee more, 
No more you’ll heed the battle cry, 
Upon Columbia’s shore.
