1. I’ve roam’d for many a lengthen’d mile
  Upon the stormy seas;
I’ve seen some twenty banners float
  Full proudly on the breeze.
That standard too, Great Britain’s pride
  The boast of England’s tars,
Yet none could thrill my heart like thee,
  My Country’s Flag of Stars.
    Yet none could thrill my heart like thee,
    My Country’s Flag of Stars.

2. Brazil’s gay flag of gorgeous dyes,
  The banner of Old Spain,
E’en Gallia’s bunting as it flies,
  Is not undimm’d by stain.
Their lustre has been sullied oft
  At home by deadly jars,
But the bright azure fold is pure,
  My Country’s Flag of Stars.
    But the bright azure fold is pure,
    My Country’s Flag of Stars.

3. In some fam’d foreign port I’ve seen
  The ships of half the world,
To celebrate some gala day,
  Their bunting all unfurl’d.
With eager heart, I’ve glanced my eye
  Along their tap’ring spars,
Until my gaze has fixed on thee,
  My Country’s Flag of Stars.
    Until my gaze has fixed on thee,
    My Country’s Flag of Stars.

4. And as thy stripes and starspeck’d field
  Broke on my eager sight,
My heart beat strong, my bosom thrilled
  With unalloyed delight.
I hailed thee as the cynosure
  Of thee Columbian Tars;
The banner of the brave and free,
  My Country’s Flag of Stars.
    The banner of the brave and free,
    My Country’s Flag of Stars.

5. Oh where’s the heart, possessing but
  One spark of freedom’s zeal,
That does not, gazing on thy folds,
  A patriot’s spirit feel.
What veteran too, as he looks down
  Upon his dear bought scars,
That does not hail thee with delight,
  My Country’s Flag of Stars.
    That does not hail thee with delight,
    My Country’s Flag of Stars.
