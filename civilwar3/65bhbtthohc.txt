1. Bring him back to the home of his childhood,
And lay him down to rest,
For that noble heart hath ceas’d to beat,
Within that manly breast;
For a winding sheet, O yield him
The banner of his pride,
In life it waved above his head,
In its defence he died,
  In life it waved above his head,
  In its defence he died.

2. Bring him back to the home of his childhood,
Where mourners gather now,
To press the last fond kiss of love,
Upon his marble brow;
No more in the field of battle,
Shall that young hero stand,
Never again on him shall fall
The traitor’s guilty hand.
  Never again on him shall fall
  The traitor’s guilty hand.

3. Bring him back to the home of his childhood,
Where a gentle sister’s tears,
Fall for the brother she hath lov’d,
Amid her anxious fears;
Where sweetest friendships linger,
Where cherish’d mem’ries hide,
Where the parents of his early years,
Have loved and loved, and died,
  Where the parents of his early years,
  Have loved and loved, and died.

4. Look up, O gentle Sister,
His pains are ended now,
And God was with him, though thy hand
Press’d not upon his brow;
In the quiet village churchyard,
Where weeping willows move,
The flowers bloom, and birds shall sing
Above the hero’s grave,
  The flow’ers shall bloom, and birds shall sing
  Above the hero’s grave.
