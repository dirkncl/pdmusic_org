1.
Ah, who can tell her the sad, sad story,
And wring that mothers heart with pain;
Last night so happy, with joy o'erflowing,
For she said, "My Willie's coming home again."

CHORUS
"My Willie's coming home;
My darling only son;"
Ah, who can tell her the sad, sad story,
For he Willie never more is coming home.
Poor Mother! Willie's gone.

2.
Strong, brave and noble, he looked that morning,
When forth he went at duty's call;
Freely she gave him, nor tried to save him,
For she said, "He will come come back--he is my all."

CHORUS
"My Willie sure will come;
My darling only son;"
Ah, who can tell her the sad, sad story,
For he Willie never more is coming home.
Poor Mother! Willie's gone.

3.
Oh! that this bitter, this dreadful anguish,
May not her warm heart turn to stone;
Last night so happy, with joy overflowing,
For she said "My darling Willie's coming home."

CHORUS
"My Willie's coming home,
He coming home so soon;"
Ah, who can tell her the sad, sad story,
For he Willie never more is coming home.
Poor Mother! Willie's gone.
