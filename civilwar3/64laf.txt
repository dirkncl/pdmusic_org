1. Oh! surely that is faithful love,
Which never knows decay,
But still wheree’er our foot=steps rove
Adorns and lights the way,
Which blooms alike in woe and weal
As fearlessly and well,
As fearlessly and well,
Which only fondest hearts can feel
And those who feel can tell,
Whiich only fondest hearts can feel
And those who feel can tell.

2. Unchanging as the flame that grows,
In breasts of seraph birth,
And spotless as descending snows
Ere stained by touch of earth;
And bright sas yonder arch adore
As yonder beacon true
As yonder beacon true,
Oh surely that is faithful love,
And such I bear to you.
Oh surely that is faithful love,
And such I bear to you.
