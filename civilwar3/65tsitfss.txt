1. They sleep in the far sunny Southland,
My soldier boys, fearless and brave;
They faithfully fought ’neath our banner,
The life of the nation to save.
Oh Father, forgive me for weeping,
As their comrades return from the war;
Of my own soldier boys I am thinking,
Who will come to my home never more.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
They sleep, they sleep, they sleep anw will come never more.
They sleep, they sleep, they sleep anw will come never more.

2. One fell in the Perryville batle,
By a minnie ball shot thro’ the heart,—
From a dark rebel prison, the other,
By Angels, was call’d to depart.
I know that my lost ones are happy,
They were faithful to country and God;
But my heart fondly yearns for the presence
Of my soldier boys under the sod.

3. They sleep, but rebellion is ended,
And the dark sons of Afric are free,—
They sleep but the “starspangled banner”
Proudly waves o’er the land and the sea.
They sleep with God’s heaven above them—
With no marble to point out the spot;
But the brave who have died for our country,
By the nation will ne’er be forgot.
