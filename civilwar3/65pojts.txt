1. One bright and shining morning,
All in the month of May,
The C. S. A. did “bust” up,
And Jeff he ran away;
He grabb’d up all the specie,
And with a chosen band,
This valliant man shedaddled
To work some other land.

2. But good old Uncle Sam,
Sent his boys from Michigan,
And in the State of Georgia,
They found this mighty man;
He’d girded on his armor,
His SKIRT IT was of STEEL,
But when he saw the soldiers,
Quite sick poor Jeff did feel.

3. So when this gallant SHERO,
Did see the blue coats come,
He fancied he had business,
A little way from home;
In frock and petticoat
He thought he could retreat,
But he could not fool the Yankees—
They knew him by his feet.

4. They seized the aged warrior
And strip’d off his disguise,
But Jeff he said such actions,
The U. S. should despise;
His wife then told the Colonel,
To take care of his men,
For if they made her Jeffy mad,
He might hurt some of them.

CHORUS 1
Poor old Jeff the Shero!
He said I cannot stay,
What is the price of gold,
Down in the C., S., A.?

CHORUS 2
Poor old Jeff the Shero,
He did not want to stay.
What is the price of hoops,
Down in the C., S., A.?

CHORUS 3
Poor old Jeff the Shero,
He could not get away.
What is the price of boots,
Down in the C., S., A.?

CHORUS 4
Poor old Jeff the Shero!
I think you’ll have to stay,
For we  want you very much,
Up in the U. S. A!
