1. Leave me, and save the glorious flag!
We’ll conquer or we’ll die,
And in our God we’ll put our trust
The God that rules on high.
And He’ll protect the good old fllag,
  That’s floating to the weather,
  The glorious flag, the stars and stripes,
  Shall wave and wave forever.

CHORUS 1-3.
The glorious flag, the stars and stripes,
Still float it to the weather;
The glorious old red, white and blue,
Shall wave and wave forever.

2. Leave me to die, ye moble boys,
Defend your country’s cause,
Maintain the union of the states,
The constitution, laws.
Protect the flag, our country’s flag[;
  Still float it to the weather;
  The glorious flag, the stars and stripes,
  Shall wave and wave forever.

3. Farewell my wife and darling child,
’Tis hard with you to part;
I feel my life’sblood flowing fast,
Death’s chill is on my heart.
But leave me, boys, and raise the flag,
  Still float it to the weather;
  The glorious flag, the stars and stripes,
  Shall wave and wave forever.
