1. John Morgan’s foot is on thy shore,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky! 
His hand is on thy stable door,
  Kentucky!, Oh, Kentucky!

CHORUS 1.
You’ll see your good gray mare no more;
  He’ll ride her till her back is sore, 
And leave her at some stranger’s door,
  Kentucky! Oh! Kentucky!

2. For feeding John you’re paying dear,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!
His very name now makes you fear,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!

CHORUS 2.
In every valley far and near,
  He’s gobbled every horse and steer;
You’ll rue his raids for many a year,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!

3. Yet you have many a traitorous fool,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!
Who still will be the rebel’s tool,
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!

CHORUS 3.
They’ll learn to yield to Abram’s rule
  In none but Johnny’s costly school,
At cost of every animule.
  Kentucky! Oh, Kentucky!
