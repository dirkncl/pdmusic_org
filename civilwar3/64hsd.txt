1. Smooth the hair gently
  From off his pale brow,
Fold his hands humbly
  Their work’s over now;
Close the eyes drooping
  ’Neath death’s heavy dew,
He’s somebody’s darling,
  God only knows who.

CHORUS 1
Close the eyes drooping
  ’Neath death’s heavy dew,
He’s somebody’s darling,
  God only knows who.

2. Raise his head gently,
  Rest it on flow’rs,
Calm be his slumbers,
  ’Mid these green bow’rs;
Sad eyes are watching
  Tearfully true,
He’s somedody’s darling,
  God only knows who.

CHORUS 2.
Sad eyes are watching,
  Tearfully true,
He’s somebody’s darling,
  God only knows who.

3. Place that fair ringlet
  Just threaded with gold,
O’er the still heart, where
  It rested of old.
“And see even that’s
  By bullets pierces through!
He’s somebody’s darling—
  God only knows who.”

CHORUS 3.
“And see even that’s
  By bullets pierces through!
He’s somebody’s darling—
  God only knows who.”

4. He sleeps his last sleep,
  His last battle’s fought—
Victory’s laurels
  Shall pass him unsought.
God pity the hearts
  That wait found and true—
For some hearts are waiting,
  God only knows who.

CHORUS 4.
God pity the hearts
  That wait found and true—
For some hearts are waiting,
  God only knows who.
