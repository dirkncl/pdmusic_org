1. Phebe dearest tell O tell me
  May I hope that you’ll be mine
Oh! let no cold frown repel me
  Leave me not to grief to pine;
Though ’tis told in homely fashion,
  Phebe trust the tale I tell,
Ne’er was truer purer passion,
  Than within this heart does dwell
Than within this heart does dwell.

2. Long I’ve watched each rare perfection
  Stealing o’er thy gentle brow
’Till respect became affection
  Such as that I offer now;
If you love me and will have me,
  True I’ll be in weal or woe;
But if in cold disdain you leave me,
  For a soldier I will go
For a soldier I will go.

3. Little care the brokenhearted
  What their fate by land or sea,
Phebe, if we once are parted,
  Once forever let it be.
Say then yes, or blindly, madly,
  I will rush upon the foe,
And I’ll welcome, O how gladly,
  Shot or shell that lays me low,
And I’ll welcome, O how gladly,
  Shot or shell that lays me low.
