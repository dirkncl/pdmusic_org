1. The muffled drum is beating,
There’s a sad and solemn tread,
Our Banner’s draped in mourning,
As it shrouds “th’illustrious dead,”
Proud forms are bent with sorrow,
And all Southern hearts are sore,
The Hero now is sleeping,
Noble Stonewall is no more.
’Mid the rattling of the muskets
And the cannons’ thundrous roar,
He stained the field of Glory
With his brave Life’s precious gore,
And tho’ our flag waved proudly,
We were victors ere sunset
The gallant deeds of Chancelorsville
Will mingle with regret.

2. They’ve borne him to an honor’d grave,
The Laurel crowns his brow,
By hallow’d Jame’s silent wave.
He’s sweetly sleeping now:
Virginia in the South is dear,
She holds a sacred trust,
Our fallen braves from far and near
Are cover’d with her dust;
She shrines the spot where now is laid
The bravest of them all,
The Martyr of our country’s cause,
Our Idoliz’d Stonewall;
But tho’ his spirit’s wafted
To the happy realms above;
His name shall live forever link’d
With reverence and love.
