1. To de setting of de sun
  Mississippi now do run,
From de norf to de souf to de ocean;
  For de yankee doodle Grant
  Who nebber say cant,
He gib um de natural motion.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ho, boys! de time am come!
De day of freedom born,
And you needn’t for to wonder,
At de blood and de funder,
And de storm dat do bring him on.

2. De rebels day did try,
  To build so strong an high,
Unkle Sam wiv big guns to defy dar;
  But he send um U. S. Grant,
  To show dem dat da cant
Hab a Vickeyburg an no tow nigh dar.

3. General Grant he did spy,
  Day build so strong and high,
He couldn’t climb int de town dar,
  Wid de powder an de fire,
  Send um eighty feet higher,
By de road he dig under de ground dar.

4. Unkle Sam send he Porter
  To jus he otter,
To open de doors all around dar;
  But day wouldn’t let him in,
  And so he begin
Why his bumgoats to nock um all down dar.

5. Now de yankee doodle Grant,
  Who nebber say cant,
Goin to Lake Richmond town dar;
  And de rebels understand,
  Dat he am der man,
Der walls mus come tumbling down dar.
