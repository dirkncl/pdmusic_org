  A brave lad of sixteen years, belonging to a New England
regiment, mortally wounded at Fredericksburg, and sent to
the Patent Office Hospital in Washinton, was anxiously
looking for the coming of his mother. As his last hour
approached and sight grew dim, he mistook a sympathetic
lady who was wiping the cold, clammy perspiration from his
forehead, for the expected one, and with a smile of joy
lighting up his pale face, whispered tenderly, "Is that
mother?" "Then" says the writer, drawing her towards him with
all his feeble strength, he nestled his head in her arms like
a sleeping infant, and thus died with the sweet word "Mother"
on his quivering lips.

Is that mother bending o'er me
As she sang my cradle hymn,
Kneeling there in tears before me,
Say! my sight is growing dim,
Comes she from the old home lowly,
Out among the northern hills
To her pet boy dying slowly
of war's battle wounds and ills,
To her pet boy dying slowly
of war's battle wounds and ills
Mother! Oh, we bravely battled --
Battled till the day was done
While the leaden hail storm rattled
Man to man, and gun to gun
But we failed And I am dying,
dying in my boyhood's years
There no weeping self denying
Noble death demand no tears
Fold your arms again around me,
Press again my aching head;
Sing the lullaby you sang me,
kiss me mother ere I'm dead,
sing the lullaby you sang me,
kiss me mother ere I'm dead.
