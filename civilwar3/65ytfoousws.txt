1. Yes, the flag of war Union shall wave still,
  A proud thing of beauty to see.
The boast of the patriot brave still,
  The glory and pride of the free.
Her stary fold’s bright now, as ever,
  Are floating from mountain to shore,
And perish the hand that would sever,
  A star from that relic of yore. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[overlapping voices]
[Treble.]
Yes the flag of our Union shall wave still,
A proud thing of beauty, to see,
The boast of the patriot brave, still,
The glory, the glory
The glory shall wave, the glory shall wave, shall wave, wave still,
The glory and pride of the free.
[Alto.]
Yes, the flag of our Union shall wave still,
A proud thing of beauty, to see,
The boast of the patriot brave, still,
The glory, the glory,
The pride, and the glory shall wave still, shall wave still,
The glory shall wave, still shall wave still,
The glory and pride of the free.
[Tenor.]
Yes, the flag shall wave, still,
A proud thing of beauty, of beauty to see,
The boast of the patriot brave, still,
The pride, the glory shall wave,
The glory, the glory shall wave,
The glory, the boast of the patriot brave still, the brave still,
The glory and pride of the free.
[Bass.]
Yes the flag of our Union shall wave still
A proud thing of beauty to see,
The boast of the patriot brave still shall wave still,
The pride the glory shall wave
The glory shall wave, the glory, the boast of the patriot brave, still, the brave still,
The glory and pride of the free.

2. That starspangled banner before us.
  What foe shall assail their fair land.
While freedom’s fair emblem is o’er us.
  United we ever shall stand.
Then wake the glad song of the Nation,
  Our Union for age, let it be,
While our banner in full constellation,
  Is honour’d by land, and by sea.
