1. Who sing to me the sweetest song,
They sing thy name to me,
Patria, dearest! is it wrong
That thou so dear should'st be?
All other love my heart denies;
Thine lifts me nearer to the skies;
Thy beauty is my tireless theme;
Thou art my hope, thou art my dream;
I sigh, I burn, for thee,
"For thee and only thee,"
My Native Land,
For thee and only thee,
For thee, and only thee,
My Native Land, I sigh, I burn, for thee.

2. Thy loved name is the beacon fire
That onward lighteth me
Patria! let my soul aspire,
Worthy of thee to be.
No other's cry so makes me start;
No other's pain so makes me smart:
Accurst the wretch whose daring hand
Profanes thy skirts, my Native Land,
My battle cry shall be,
"For thee, and only thee,"
My Native Land,
For thee, and only thee,
For thee, and only thee,
My Native Land, for thee, and only thee!

3. If it must be that patriot pride
Shall fail of victory
Joyous as groom unto his bride,
I come, O Death, to thee.
Welcome to me thy fateful face;
Welcome shall be thy close embrace;
Thy burning breath, thy lava kiss,
Shall bring to me unwonted bliss
My battle cry shall be,
"For God and Liberty,"
Thrice welcome Death!
For God and Liberty,
For God and Liberty,
Thrice welcome, Death! for God, and Liberty!
