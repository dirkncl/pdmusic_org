1. Soon this weary war’ll be ended, darling,
Let your heart have no more fear;
For the signs of promise never failing,
One by one are drawing near.
Soon from ev’ry plain and valley ringing,
Echoed back by ev’ry hill,
Ev’ry breeze shall hear the charming mandate—
Cease the warfare— peace, be still!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We will then be marching home in triumph,
With our banners in the breeze,
Turn and tattered tho’ its height stripes may be,
They’ll cement the bonds of peace.

2. Soon this weary war’ll be ended, darling,
Won’t you bless the happy hour
When we stand in peace and love together
’Neath the dear old grapevine bower.
Then we’ll sing the same old songs of gladness
That we sung in days of yore,
Cheer up, for the day is fast approaching
When this warfare shall be o’er.
