1. Yes Mary my Mary your father's come home.
You waited through all the long night.
He was dead to your pleadings, for reason was drown'd.
But oh! it came back with the light.
It seems like a dream oh! a terrible dream
But alas! now I know it was true,
Poor Benny is dead, but your father's come home,
Dear Mary to mother and you.

CHORUS 1
O no more through the dark weary hours...
Little Mary in sadness shall roam;
Ah how glad to her ears are the words that she hears,
Dear Mary your "father's come home".

2. Please Mary tell mother that "father's come home".
And kneels by our little boys bed,
And he prays for God's help that the husband may fill
The place of the boy that is dead,
And say tho' he left her forsaken to weep
All alone to bear sorrow and pain.
He'll never more cause her a pang or a tear,
If once she will trust him again.

CHORUS 2
O no more shall the wife watch and weep...
All in vain for the loved one to come...
And all gone are her fears as the message she hears
Tell mother that "father's come home".

3. Yes Mary tell mother that father has left.
The drink has made him so bad.
You can say he has taken the Temperance Pledge
I know it will make her heart glad!
And tell her he waits to clasp mother and child
And vow on his knees to be true,
For her father's come home to his reason at length,
Dear Mary to mother and you.

CHORUS 3
O no more to the mother and child...
Shall the night black & desolate come...
For the fire shall be bright & their hearts shall be light
while saying dear "father's come home".
