1. You may boast of fancy Reg’ments,
  With their clothes of ev’ry hue;
Of the famous Zouave D’Afrique:
  With the flaming cap and que.
You may talk of Reg’ment so and so,
  Of Comp’ny this and that;
But give me a noble fellow,
  With a bucktail in his hat,
  With a bucktail, a bucktail, a bucktail in his hat.

2. Lithe of limb and firm of purpose,
  Penna’s choicest volunteers;
Oh! for the glorous bucktails:
  Three times three tremendous cheers.
There are strong and brave and faithful
  Tho’ they never boast of that;
Then give me a noble fellow,
  With a bucktail in his hat,
  With a bucktail, a bucktail, a bucktail in his hat.

3. First they’ll be where shots are flying,
  First in peace when war is done;
First in the hearts of loving ones;
  Who’ll welcome them at home.
If the foe were twice as mighty,
  They would give him tit for tat;
Then give me a noble fellow;
  With a bucktail in his hat.
  With a bucktail, a bucktail, a bucktail in his hat.
