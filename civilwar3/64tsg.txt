RECITATIVE
Night shades are falling o’er the plain,
The signal gun now booms again,
While serried legions hurrying by
Resolve to conquer or to die,
Resolve, resolve to conquer or to die.

1. The battle rages, on ye brave,
Go where our glorious standards wave,
The star of vict’ry lights the way,
And brighter grows its burning ray,
As Freedom’s legions charge upon the foe.

2. The sabres clash, the beaming gun,
The smoke of battle rolling dun;
The furious charge, the victors’ shout,
The broken best, the flying rout,
Declare the traitors pride and glory lost.

3. Columbia o’er your heroes brave,
For ever let your standards wave,
Assist the weak, protect the strong,
And ever be your joyous song,
The glorious anthem of the brave and free.
