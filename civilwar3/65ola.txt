1. Our Lincoln’s act immortal!
In ev’ry land and tongue,
Where ever man loves fellow man,
His praises will be sung.
All power and pelf that end in self
Are naught but vanity;
They crown themselves with immortelles
Who serve humanity.

CHORUS 1
How glorious the sight
The ages all can see
He rises to the height
Of God’s eternal right,
He rises to the height
Of God’s eternal right,
And sets four million, sets four million free.

2. For centuries of bondage
And unrequited toil,
The judgements of the Lord are true,
Our blood has drenched the soil.
But now success our arms will bless,
The captive shall go free,
And slav’ry host, with all its boast
Go down in war’s red sea.

CHORUS 2
Let Liberty’s old bell
Awake the morning breeze
To all the good news tell
That not a slave shall dwell,
To all the good news tell
That not a slave shall dwell,
Between our ocean, ’tween our ocean seas.

3. Dusk mothers, clasp your children,
And husbands claim your wives,
The auction block has power no more
To separate your lives.
No more you’ll tread the wine press red
Of Egypt’s cruelty;
The other side of Jordan’s tide
Your heritage shall be.

CHORUS 3
Sing praises unto God,
A song of jubilee
Led thro’ the sea dry shod,
The wilderness all trod,
Led thro’ the sea dry shod,
The wilderness all trod,
The promised land, the promised land you see.

4. No longer scoffs the Old World
At freedom in the New,
This New Year’s morn rounds out the truth
The fathers had in view;
Our standard sheet is emblem meet
Of human liberty,
For all the souls beneath its folds
With freemen shall be free.

CHORUS 4
All hail the vision bright
A people truly free
Where none can take by might,
From others any right,
Where none can take by might,
From others any right,
They for themselves, they for themselves decree.
