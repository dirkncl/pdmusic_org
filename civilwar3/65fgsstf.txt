1. For God’s sake soldiers save the flag,
  Shield it from tyrants hands.
Oh! save our glorious banner now
  It guards our native land!
Oh! save the emblem of the free,
  This is the peopleˆs cry.
It is the type of liberty
  Our nation must not die!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Come rally at your chieftain’s call.
Let not one freeman lag.
Go drive the traitors from our land,
And save our glorious flag!

2. Go forward boys and charge the foe
  Where treason flaunts its rag!
Go give your lives for freedomt’s cause,
  And save our glorious flag!
Rebellion’s rife within our land,
  Hear how the tyrant’s brag.
The nation sounds her notes of war,
  O, save our glorious flag!

3. O soldiers save the stars and stripes,
  See how they proudly wave,
Go save the nation from its woes,
  Ye loyal true and brave!
“Comrades I’m  shot!” the soldier cried,
  Drive back the trait’rous band,
O, save our glorious banner now
  The ensign of our land!
