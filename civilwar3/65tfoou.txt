1. The Flag of our Union is over us yet,
  O’er the soldier of freedom it waves,
On the banks of the stream in the far southern clime,
  It floats o’er the patriot’s grave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We’ve lost not a star, we’ve lost not a star;
  From the banner that over us waves,
Tho’ the smoke of the battle has clouded it oft,
  Still it floats o’er the land of the brave.

2. In the van of the flight when the roar of our guns,
  Dealth death to the traitorous crew,
When the sky was obscured by the smoke wreaths of war,
  We hallowed the Red, White and Blue.

3. ’Neath that bright starry emblem the flag of the free,
  Our honor we’ll ever maintain,
Til the red demon war shall be banished from earth,
  And peace comes in triumph to reign.
