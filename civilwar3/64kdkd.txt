[CHORUS repeat before and after each verse]
Katy did, Katy didn’t, 
Katy did, Katy didn’t, 
Ka ty did, Katy didn’t, 
Katy didn’t, she didn’t I know. 

1. Katy had an ancient lover, 
Oh, his head was white as snow, 
He was worth a mint of money, 
Katy didn’t love him though. 

2. Katy didn’t, but Katy’s father, 
Katy’s father did and would 
Love the old man and his money, 
And he vowed that Katy didn’t, 

3. Katy wrung her hands and cried, sir,
And before her father knelt,
I couldn’t begin to tell you
If I tried how bad she felt.

4. Katy knew a younger miss, sir,
With the blackest eyes and hair,
Whether he’d got any money
Katy didn’t know or care. 

5. This young man was— fond of— Katy,
As the little sly rogue knew,
And she forthwith went and asked him
What he thought she’d better do.

6. This young man was not a fool, sir,
And he loved the little elf,
So what do you think he did, sir,
Why, he married her himself.
