1. Comrades, comrades I am dying!
  See the crimson fountain flow!
Sick and wounded I am dying!
  On the field among the foe;
But the angels hover round me,
  They will guard me while I sleep;
Comrades onward to the battle,
  Do not for the soldier weep.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Comrades, comrades I am dying!
See the crimson fountain flow!
Sick and wounded I am dying,
On the field among the foe!

2. Comrades, comrades I am dying!
  For I see my mother now;
See her coming down from heaven
  With a wreath upon her brow.
God has sent her to the soldier,
  She will teach him how to die!
And when He hath called my spirit
  She will bear it to the sky.

3. Comrades, comrades I am dying!
  Soon I’ll be among the blessed,
Fare— oh! fare you well forever,
  I am going there to rest.
For my mother’s arms entwine me,
  And I can no longer stay;
Onward comrades to the battle,
  Angels they will lead the way.
