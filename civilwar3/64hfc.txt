1. O, I’se bound for Charleston, good bye Chloe dear;
  For Gilmore hah knocked Sumpter down
And hah waited long for de brack Volunteers,
  To come dah and help take de town.

CHORUS 1-3.
Den Hurrah! for Charleston! take care Bulleguard,
  We’ve laid down de hoe for de gun;
If you don’t look out you’ll get kicked mighty hard,
  If Greekfire don’t make you run.

2. Our old Massa’s gone where sesesh cannon’s roar,
  To  fight ’gainst de “Red, White and Blue,”
If I cotch him dah, he wont lash me no more,
  Nor sell off de chil’ren from you.

3. Now de boys have come and are calling for me,—
  Good bye Chloe darling once more,—
We shall meet again and live happy and free,
  When war shall de Union restore.
