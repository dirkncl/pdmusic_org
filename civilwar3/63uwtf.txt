1. Oh! come, boys, come, wish a merry heart and will; 
Up with the flag, Up with the flag, 
And bear  it onward to victory still, 
Up with the flag, and away! 
Its bright stars twinkly in the rosy morning light, 
Up with the flag, Up with the flag, 
Blessing e’er for “God and the Right,” 
Up with the flag, and away! 
Spread its folds our proudly and free; 
Up with the flag, Up with the flag! 
Let it wave o’er the land and the sea; 
Up with the flag and away! 
Rally, boys, to the banner that we love, 
Up with the flag, Up with the flag! 
“Deo Vindice,” victorious we’ll prove, 
Up with the flag and away!

2. Oh, hasten, brothers, the proud foe to meet;
Up with the flag, Up with the flag,
For the hordes of the North are doomed to defeat;
Up with the flag, and away!
We’ll plant our flag on the fierce battlefield,
Up with the flag, Up with the flag,
And die ’neath its folds, but never, never yield,
Up with the flag, and away!
Up with the flag, with a loud, hearty cheer;
Up with the flag, Up with the flag,
Symbol of Freedom, to Southern hearts dear
Up with the flag, and away!
Banner of hope— let the nations of earth,
Up with the flag, Up with the flag,
Honor its claims, and the cause of its birth,
Up with the flag, and away!

3. Hark, boys, hark! to the roll of the drum!
Up with the flag, Up with the flag.
Your homes are invaded, come, lads, come!
Up with the flag, and away!
Oh! stay not, comrades, meet the dark host—
Up with the flag, Up with the flag.
Strike for your firesides— stand to your post,
Up with the flag, and away!
God, your defender, surely, will be—
Up with you flag, Up with your flag.
Brave hearts win, when resolved to be free.
Up with your flag, and away!
Up with the battle-flag! sound the alarm!
Up with the flag, Up with the flag.
Heed not their numbers, arm! boys, arm!
Up with the flag, and away!
