1. I知 waiting love, while drops the dew,
  And mant値ing night around me falls,
The morning sun my hopes made new,
  Its fading light my spirit palls. 

CHORUS 1.
Im waiting, I知 waiting,
I知 waiting love, for thee to come to me
Fall all around is sad and lone.

2. I知 listening love, thy voice to hear.
  Its deathless echoes thrill my soul;
I gave my country all that痴 dear,
  The precious gifts beyond control.

CHORUS 2.
I知 listening, I知 listening,
I知 listening love, for thee to come to me
For all around is sad and lone.

3. I知 sighing love, and every sigh
  Is from my throbbing heart, a wave
To toss my hopes, to wreck and die
  If thou should痴t find a soldier痴 grave.

CHORUS 3.
I知 sighing, I知 sighing,
I知 sighing llove, for thee to come to me
For all around is sad and lone.

4. I知 weeping love, my shrinking head
  Above the waters will not stay,
I致e learned alas! that thou art dead
  And earthly hopes have not a ray.

CHORUS 4.
I知 weeping,  I知 weeping,
I知 weeping love, for thee thou wilt not come
To cheer my heart so sad and lone.

5. I知 dying love, my heart is broke,
  As ties of earth are sunder riven;
I fall beneath death痴 final stroke
  With hope to meet thee, love, in heav地.

CHORUS 5.
I知 dying, I知 dying,
I知 dying love, for me my Savior痴 come
And I知 not left to die alone.
