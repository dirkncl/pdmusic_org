1. Hail to the legions of the West!
  A hundred crimsoned fields of glory
For them proclaim that fadeless fame
  That breaths in song, and lives in story,
With “iron will,” and dauntless breast,
  They strike to save the land that bore them;
Hail to the legions of the West!
  That bear our grand old banner o’er them!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hail, hail, hail, hail,
Hail to the legions of the West.
Hail, hail, hail, hail,
Hail to the legions of the West.

2. Hands that have felled the forest oak,
  And torn the towering clif asunder;
Hands that the virgin soil have broke,
  And made the sledge and anvil thunder.
These are the hands, by heaven blest,
  That drive our vanquished foe before them;
Hail to the legions of the West!
  That bear our grand old banner o’er them!

3. Since Sumter’s stars and stripes went down,
  How dark the Nation’s night of sorrow;
But, thanks to God, the night is gone,
  And brighter, purer, dawns the morrow!
Back to the South, no more oppressed,
  They bear our “colors” to restore them;
Hail to the legions of the West!
  That bear our grand old banner o’er them!
