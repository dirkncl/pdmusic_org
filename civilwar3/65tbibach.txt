1. The Boys in Blue are coming,
  Are coming home tonight,
For the cruel war is over,
  And our boys have won the fight;
Yes, now I see the banners,
  They’re floating in the light:
Oh! joy, the boys are coming—
  They are coming home tonight.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
The Boys in Blue are coming home—
They’re coming home tonight.

2. Oh, how the fifes are screaming,
  And how the drummers play,
They cheer for Grant and Sheridan,
  Who led them in the fray;
There’s not a soul among them
  But was a hero in the fight:
Oh, joy! the boys are coming—
  They are coming home tonight.

3. Go out and fire the cannon,
  And twine the laurel crown—
There’s joy among the people,
  As the troops come marching down;
Shout, shout aloud for vict’ry,
  Thank God for peace and right:
The Boys in Blue are coming—
  They are coming home tonight,

4. Then, fill the silver goblet,
  And fill it to the brim—
We’ll drink to Gen’ral Sherman
  And the boys who march with him;
There’s a joy, sweet joy among us,
  And our eyes have seen the sight:
The Boys in Blue are coming,
  They are coming home tonight.
