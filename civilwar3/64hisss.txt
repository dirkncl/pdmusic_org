1. He is sleeping, sweetly sleeping
Beneath the green turf mound
While angel’s watch are keeping.
In  solemn silence round
Oft in dreams I see my loved one
Foremost in the raging strife
Ah! see! he’s wounded oh he’s dying,
Hark he says my wife, my wife 
He is sleeping, sweetly sleeping
Beneath the green turf. 

Lay him down silently speak not a word
Over him carefully place the greensward
Gently his spirit is wafted on high
’Tis sweet oh ’tis sweet for our country to die.

2. Comrades bear this message to her
To my angel far away
Tell her how I fought for freedom
On our country’s matal day.
Kindly yes! so kindly tell her
How I nobly fought and fell.
Struggling for our country’s banner
Must I bid this world farewell.
