1. All honor and fame to the gallant and brave,
  Who forces the rebs out of their holes—
Fling out the old bannor, boys proud let it wave
  With the sun shining bright on its folds.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! boys, Hurrah! shout glory, and sing,
  For the traitors look sadly forsaken;
Our glorious old Eagle is yet on the wing
  And Vicksburg is taken, boys, taken.

2. That flag, now begrim’d with the carnage of war,
  Grows better and purer with time,
For Freedom is pollishing slowly each star
  From the rust of oppression and crime.

3. Bring out the spare powder and fire the big guns,
  The rebs are surprised at the way
Columbia’s loyal and truehearted sons
  Have honored their country’s BirthDay.

4. Yes Vicksburg is ours! O, Glory! Hurrah!
  Won’t all these head rebels feel gay!
And the greatest arch traitor the world ever saw—
  Old Jeff,— will feel sick, boys, today!

5. His great C. S. A. is now severed in twain,
  And both of them shortly must die—
But he will not forget, to the end of his reign,
  That wonderful Fourth of July!
