1. They watched their leader’s words with awe; 
Should they lay down their arms? 
But in his eyes they quickly saw 
What silenced their alarms. 
Calmly he laid his laurels down, 
His beart was rent and sore; 
He loved the hands which twined that crown, 
But loved his country more.

2. He would not lift his patriot hand 
Against “the powers that be” 
But nobly says “By Burnside stand, 
As you have stood by me, 
And all will then be well— Goodbye!” 
Most gracious words of cheer! 
Though darkness had o’er spread the sky, 
Their duty now was clear.

3. ’Tis easy for a fragile barque 
O’er smooth still seas to glide! 
But when the waves are high and dark, 
’Tis then its strength is tried. 
O noble hero! Patriot brave! 
Though sudden came the storm, 
Then didst not sink beneath the wave, 
But to thy Goal are borne.

4. A battle thou  hast found and won, 
More glorious far than all 
Potomac’s army e’er has done, 
Or e’en than Richmond’s Fall. 
This crowning lesson, dearly bought, 
May  far more blessed prove, 
Than any lesson thou hast taught 
The army of thy love.

5. Though midnight has her mantle spread 
Upon thy rising fame, 
The glorios orb of day shall shed 
A halo round thy name.
