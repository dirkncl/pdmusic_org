1. ’Tis coming up the steeep of Time, 
And this old world is growing brighter, 
We may not see its dawn sumlime, 
Yet high hopes makes the heart throb lighter, 
We may be sleeping in the ground, 
When it awakes the world in wonder, 
But we have felt it gath’ring round, 
And heard its voice of living thunder 
’Tis coming, O! yes ’tis coming.

2. ’Tis coming new, the glorious time 
Foretold by Seers and sung in story, 
For which, when thinking was a crime, 
Souls leaped to Heaven from scafolds gory! 
They passed, nor saw the work they wrought, 
Nor the crowning hopes of centuries blossom, 
But the live lightnihng of their thought, 
And daring deeds, doth pulse Earth’s bosom 
’Tis coming, O! yes ’tis coming.

3. Creeds, Empires, systems rot with age, 
But the great people’s ever youthful, 
And it shall write the fateful page 
To one humanity more truthful, 
There is divinity within 
That makes men great where’re they will it. 
God works with all who dare to win, 
And the time cometh to reveal it 
’Tis coming, O! yes ’tis coming.

4. Freedom, the tyrants kill thy braves 
Yet in our mem’ries live the sleepers, 
And though millions feed the graves 
Dug by death’s fierce red handed reappers, 
The world shall not forever bow 
To things that mock God’s own endeavor, 
’Tis nearer that they dream of now, 
When flowers shall wreath the sword for ever 
’Tis coming, O! yes  ’tis coming.

5. Ah! it must come, oppression’s throne 
Is crumbling by our hot tears rusted. 
The sword that traitor hands have drawn 
Is cankered with our heart blood crusted; 
Room for the men of Mind, make way, 
Ye robber traitors strive no longer, 
Ye cannot stay the opening day, 
The world rolls on, the light grows stronger 
’Tis coming, O! yes ’tis coming.
