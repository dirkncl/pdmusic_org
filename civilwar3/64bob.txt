1. Bird of Beauty, whose bright plumage
  Sparkles with a thousand dyes,
Soft thy notes and gay thy carol,
  Though stern winter rules the skies,
Soft thy notes and gay thy carol,
  Though stern winter rules the skies. 

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, ala, la, la.
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, ala, la, la, la.

2. Com’st thou to me in the silence
  Of my snowclad home to cheer?
Dost thou bear a message to me,
  From the friends beloved and dear?
Dost thou bear a message to me,
  From the friends beloved and dear?

3. Where the southern roses blossom,
  By the prairie’s spreading plain,
I have listened to thy warbling,
  Charmed by the magic strain,
I have listened to thy warbling,
  Charmed by the magic strain.

4. Welcome! for a leaf, sweet wanderer,
  Thou hast plucked and borne to me,
Bearing words of joy and gladness,
  Mingled with sweet melody,
Bearing words of joy and gladness,
  Mingled with sweet melody.
