Toll ye bells a solemn dirge,
Earth shall join the sad refrain;
And the sea’s remotest surge,
Moan for Freedom’s chapion slain.
Veil thy radiance glowing sun;
Mood and stars go out in gloom;
Weep yes skies for hopes undone,
Weep a kingly patriot’s doom.
Banner worshipped by the brave
Fairest ensign of the free,
With thy sable emblems wave,
Drooping low and mournfully.

[Solo Quartette.]
Oh, ye vales and verdant isles!
How can beauty gild ye so?
Why should ye be dress’d in smiles,
When our human hearts o’erflow?
Is it some celestial beam
From the gates of Paradise?'
Is it Heaven’s refulgent gleam,
Half revealed to mortal eyes?

(Chorus.)
Wide unfold your scenes of light,
Glorious ream, no pen can paint,
Welcome him ye thongs in white,
Crown him Hero, Martyr, Saint.
Crown him Hero, Martyr, Saint.
