1. 
Oh listen a while, and I will sing
Of my first and only love.
’Twas a maiden fair, with curley hair;
And gentle as a dove.
Her slender form was full of grace,
Her waist was neat and slim,
She had a dark and rolling eye
With a dimple in her chin.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Miss Sarah Jane was this maiden’s name,
She’s known to all full well,
With her roquish smile and dashing style,
She’s such a nice young gal.

2. 
The first time I saw sweet Sarah Jane,
Her age it was seventeen,
It was in a shopmade clothing store
At the sewingmachine.
Her glossy curls hung down her back,­­
Forget I never shall
For that’s the time I fell in love
With this very nice young gal.

3. 
We went out one day to promenade,
So happy arm in arm,
She espied her great big Cousin Bob,
Which fill’d me with alarm.
Up steps a tall big six foot chap,
He was a volunteer,
He shook my Sally by the hand
Whilst I felt all over queer.

4. 
Now judge of my astonishment
When Sally left my side,
And clung to the arm of Cousin Bob,
Which touch’d my wounded pride.
Says I, Sall, what is this you mean,
Your answer quickly tell­­
“Now just walk off my valant friend”
Said this very nice young gal.

5. 
Oh I scarcely could believe my ears,
And the cruel words she said,
At just then her great big Cousin Bob­­
He swore he’d break my head,
First came the words, and then the blows,
As on the ground I fell;
While round the corner quickly went
Along with this nice young gal.
