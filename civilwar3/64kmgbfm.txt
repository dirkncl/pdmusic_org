1. My heart is growing weaker,
  My sight is growing dim,
And all the scenes of boyhood
  Before my vision swim;
I hear now now the thunder
  Of battle round me roll,
Kiss me good bye fir mother,
  Ere death shall call my soul.

CHORUS 1-3.
Tell her I died a soldier,
  Where death was flying fast,
And kiss me for my mother,
  Good bye ere life has passed.

2. Oh! strive to soothe here anguish,
  When she shall learn my death,
And tell her how I whisper’d
  Her name with fleeting breath;
And since amid the battle,
  Thou art beside me here,
Kiss me good bye for mother,
  My sinking heart ’twill cheer.

3. Oh! would that I might see her
  If but to press her hand,
For death would not be painful,
  If she could near me stand;
But since she’s absent from me,
  And knows now where I die,
Kiss me good bye for mother,
  A fond and last good bye.
