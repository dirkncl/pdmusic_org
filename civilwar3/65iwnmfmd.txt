1. I’ll weep no more for mother dear,
So free from care and ev’ry pain;
And I will check the flowing tear,
I would not call her back again.
I would not break her quiet rest.
But let the roses o’er her grow,
And plant fresh flow’rs above her breast,
While willows bend their branches low.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I’ll weep no more for mother dear,
So free from care and ev’ry pain;
And I will check the flowing tear,
I would not call her back again.

2. I’ll bid each rising sigh depart,
And dream of joys when but a child;
When pleasures cluster’d round my heart,
And she my youthful hours beguil’d.
For now her spirit hovers near,
A guardian angel pure and mild;
She whispers love my heart to cheer,
And guards the footsteps of her child.
