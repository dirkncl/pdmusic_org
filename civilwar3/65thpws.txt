1.
Again Spring's soft green robe is spread,
Where, on their grateful country's breast,
The forms of our brave soldier dead
Lie dust to dust, in peaceful rest.

REFRAIN
Rest, rest, rest, rest, in realms of joy,
ye brave and blest, rest, rest!

2.
Today this hallow'd place we seek,
And backward turn our tender thought,
While grateful loving words we speak
For all their life and death have wrought.

(REFRAIN)
