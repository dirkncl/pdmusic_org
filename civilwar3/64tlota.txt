1.
Off Cherbourg Port one summer day,
Our noble ship the Kearsarge lay,
Quite anxious her respects to pay,
  Unto the Alabama;
She had as bold and brave a crew,
As ever sail'd o'er ocean blue,
Whose hearts bent on "putting through,"
  The Pirate Alabama.

CHORUS
Then mesmates let your voices swell,
And let us now in music tell,
Of "Winslow" whom we love so well,
Who sunk the Alabama.

2.
Brave! Captain Semmes had sail'd the sea,
O'er many a Merchant Vessel, he,
Had won a brilliant victory
  With his great Alabama;
He had a thieving British crew,
Who unto nature's instint true,
Could pillage, rob, and murder too,
  Upon his Alabama.

(CHORUS)

3.
Her guns wer cast in British sand,
By British sailors they were manned,
And British shipwrights, built and planned,
  The Pirate Alabama;
And let the truth be plainly told,
How she was bought with British gold,
By British merchants armed and coaled,
  The Pirate Alabama.

(CHORUS)

4.
So Captain Semmes quite confident,
That British crews were excellent,
Sent out a challenge insolent,
  From his great Alabama;
And boastingly did he aver,
He'd meet the Kearsarge -- punish her,
And "thrashing sound" administer,
  With his dear Alabama.

(CHORUS)

5.
Poor devil! little had he thought
The combat which he had besought,
Could end in victory for might,
  Save his Alabama;
So steaming outward in the bay,
To where the gallant Kearcharge lay,
Went dashing from her bow the spray,
  The Pirate Alabama.

(CHORUS)

6.
Brave "Winslow" and his noble crew,
Their feeling scarcely could subdue,
As they saw coming in their view,
  The Pirate Alabama.
For Yankee tars had heretofore,
Met crews such as the Pirates bore,
And in their hearts the sailors swore,
  They'd sink the Alabama.

(CHORUS)

7.
The Ship for action was prepared,
The "Stars and Stripes" raised overhead,
From cannons mouth a ball was sped
  Unto the Alabama.
The flew a storm of Iron hail,
Which caused the Pirate crew to quail,
As "Winslow" boldly did assail,
  The Pirate Alabama.

(CHORUS)

8.
The battle raged an hour or so,
When Captain Semmes began to show,
That he had met his overthrow,
  And lost his Alabama;
Then "Winslow" in her hull, did pour,
A broadside as she steered for shore,
She sunk, and Semmes shall never more,
  Behold his Alabama.

(CHORUS)

9.
The coward "Deerhound" now bereft
Of hope commnenced her sneaking theft,
And stole what pris'ners we had left,
  From the Great Alabama.
A day of reck'ning yet will come,
When Yankee fife, and Yankee drum,
Will cause the British to succumb,
  And give up Alabama.

(CHORUS)

MORAL [10.]
Now Briishers do you beware,
And don't to combat Yankee's dare,
Or you perhaps the fate may share,
  Of Semmes' Alabama;
For "Uncle Sam" will never stand,
An insult on the sea or land;
The men and ships at his command,
  Can sink all Alabama's.

(CHORUS)
