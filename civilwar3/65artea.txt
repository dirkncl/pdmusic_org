1. Do not leave me now to mourn in sadness,
For I ne’er shall see thy fave again;
And my troubled heart will know no gladness,
As I wait for thy return in vain.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then stay my dearest stay, I pray,
And drive my ancious fears away;
Then stay my dearest stay, I pray,
Oh, stay with me, Oh stay with me, I pray.

2. True to thee hast been my heart’s devotion,
And I’ve lov’d thee from my childhood years;
Yield thy will to cross the angry ocean,
Stay with me and check these flowing tears.
