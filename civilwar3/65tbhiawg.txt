1. They buried hin in a wat’ry grave,
Far away from his native home,
There unwearied ocean’s wind and wave,
O’er that brave son will chant;
His wining smile and dear lov’d form,
His words full of kindness and love.
We will know no more save thro’ mem’ry’s pow’r,
’Till we meet our dear brother above.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
His winning smile and dear lov’d form,
His words full of kindness and love;
We will know no more save thro’ mem’ry’s pow’r,
’Till we meet our dear brother above.

2. We gave him up when his country call’d,
We laid him on Freedom’s holy shrine,
And we’ll murmur not, for Thou O, God!
Hath call’d him home to a happier Clime;
There he wears the crown of light,
That decks the brow of heroes blest;
There he’s freed from all earthly strife,
And enjoys the calm of heavrnly rest.

3. We cannot strew his turf with flowers,
For ’neath his cold bed he slumbers in the wave;
But we’ll trust in God, His will is ours,
And love the sea, for ’tis his grave;
O, Father above, in Whom we trust,
Give strength to our anguished hearts;
And guide us safe to that heavenly shore,
Where we’ll meet no more to part.
