1. For many years we’ve waited 
To hail the day of peace, 
When our land shall be united, 
And war and strife shall cease; 
And now that day approaches— 
The drums are beating fast, 
And all the boys are coming home. 
There’s victory at last. 

FULL CHORUS [sung after each verse]
There’s victory at last, boys, 
victory at last! 
O’er land and sea 
Our flag is free; 
We’ll nail it to the mast; 
Yes, we’ll nail it to the mast, boys, 
Nail it to the mast, 
For there’s victory, victory, 
victory at last!

2. The heroes who have gained it, 
And lived to see that day, 
We will meet with flying banners 
And honors on the way; 
And all their sad privations 
Shall to the wind be cast, 
For all the boys are coming home. 
There’s victory at last.

3. O happy wives and childred, 
Light up your hearts and homes, 
For see, with martial music 
“The conquering  hero come.” 
With flags and streamers flying, 
While drums are beating fast: 
For all the boys are coming home. 
There’s victory at last.
