1.
My Sallie Long I’ve lov’d you dear,
  And longer still I may,
And Love, if you but had the chink,
  I’d marry you today;
This heart and hand would soon be yours,
  If you but had the dimes:
A purse as long and lank as thine,
  Won’t do for these hard times!
  Won’t do for these hard times!

2.
There’s Mollie Grimes, she offer’d me
  Her fortune and her heart,
If I’d consent to change her name
  And make her Mollie Smart;
But then her fortune prov’d to be
  So very far away
I thought before I got the tin,
  There might be some delay.
  There might be some delay. 

3.
They say you have an Uncle, love,
  That’s very rich and old,
And that he means to leave to you
  His silver and his gold;
If so my love, my dearest love,
  Don’t throw yourself away,
But take my heart and give me yours
  And name the happy day.
  And name the happy day.

4.
Your fortune now’s too small for me,
  I’m sure it would not suit,
I cannot give my heart for thine
  Unless you give me boot;
Then Sallie while your Uncle lives,
  I’ll flirt with cousin Sue,
And when he dies if you know what,
  In faith I’ll marry you!
  In faith I’ll marry you!
