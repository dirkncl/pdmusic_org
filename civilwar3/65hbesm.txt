1. Hushed be each sorrowing murmur,
  And let no hot tears be shed,
As in slow march with drooping standards,
  Ye bear back the gallant dead,
It is well our sad blood offering,
  Should be so sure a breast,
That the cowards treach’rous bullet,
  Should find this stainless crest.
That the cowards treach’rous bullet,
  Should find this stainless crest.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dead, dead, with a heart so loyal,
  That our full hearts dare not weep.
Gently, gently, gently
  lay the true and loyal to his
holy, happy, peaceful sleep.

2. For among hero saints and martyrs,
  None to claim him bending low
There is none bears a heart so loyal,
  None who wear a brighter crown
Blessed they among the children,
  Whom dear motherland has nursed,
Whose joyous blood beneath her banner,
  Gushes fullest, freeest, first.
Whose joyous blood beneath her banner,
  Gushes fullest, freeest, first.

3. Wrap the flag he loved around him,
  Beside him lay his shining blade,
Fold the cold hands prayerfully
  Above the heart in stillness laid.
Happy hero on the field promoted,
  From soldiers tent to patriots grave.
Bear to his rest the youthful martyr,
  Loved of the land he tried to save.
Bear to his rest the youthful martyr,
  Loved of the land he tried to save.
