1. Yes he’s coming home, my darling,
  From the field where fiery Mars
Holds his carnival in honor
  Of the dear old “Stripes and Stars”
And impatiently I’m waiting,
  While the tedious hours delay
For my gallant soldier lover
  Who is coming home to day.

CHORUS 1-4.
Oh he’s coming (coming, coming)
Yes he’s coming home to day
My brave and bonnie soldier
He is coming home to day
Oh! my eyes were dim and tearful
As I watched him go away
Looking oh! so brave and fearless,
But he’s coming home to day.

2. In the thickest of the battle
  It has been his fate to stand,
Fighting as becomes a hero
  For his wronged and outraged land:
But the fierce and angry missiles
  From his heart were turned away
By a hand unseen and potent,
  And he’s coming home to day.

3. How my cheek turned pale with terror,
  How my heart stood still with fright,
When they told me how he.d battled
  In the thickest of the fight.
And I prayed that God would shield him
  In the terrible affray,
And forbid the balls to harm him—
  But he’s coming home today.

4. He is good as his is gallant,
  And has such a charming air,
And such mischiefmaking glances,
  And such waves of curling hair.
Oh, my life is full of gladness,
  And my heart with pleasure gay,
For my love is true and faithful,
  And is coming home today.
