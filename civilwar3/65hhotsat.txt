1. And I! must swing upon that tree,—
  Oh curs’d unhappy lot,
Like any “Wolf” to worried be,
  Or “chock’d” right on the spot;
My “noble” heart will sure give way,
  Whene’er that “Tree” I see,
I fear “repentance” is too late,
  For that “Sour Apple Tree.”

2. No man on earth that draweth breath,
  More courage “had” than I,
I dared my foes unto their face,
  And “did not from them fly,”
The “croakers” all I did keep down,
  Like “Falstaff” manfully,—
I wonder, one “like me” should “swing,”
  On that “Sour Apple Tree.”

3. King Cotton’s band I did command,
  With courage more by far,
Than ever did a General
  His Army’s in the war.
I have ruled for Four long years,
  And live’d most nanfully—
Curse my fate, that I should swing,
  On that “Sour Apple Tree.”


4. As for my life I do not care,
  If justice would take place;
And bring my rebel followers,
  Unto the same disgrace,
My people who are just as bad,
  I hope they’ll not go free,
But give them all the same,— a taste
  From the “Sour Apple Tree.”

5. The Yanks they come! my time is short,
  The “last ditch” I must make.
I’ll use this “knife” and “female skirts,”
  For fear my neck they’ll break,
Now all my friends, both “great” and small,
  A warning take from me,
Remember when for “plunder” you start,
  There’s a “Sour Apple Tree.
