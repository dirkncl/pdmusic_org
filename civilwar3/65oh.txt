1. Cheers! cheers, for our heroes!
Not those who wear stars;
Not those who wear eagles,
And leaflets and bars;
We know they are gallant,
And honor them, too,
For bravely maintaining
The Red, White and Blue!
  For bravely maintaining
  The Red, White and Blue!

2. But, cheers for our soldiers,
Rough wrinkled and brown;
The men who make heroes
And ask no renown
Unselfish, untiring,
Intrepid and true,
The bulwark surrounding
The Red, White and Blue!
  The bulwark surrounding
  The Red, White and Blue!

3. Our patriot soldiers!
When Treason arose,
And Freedom’s own children
Assailed her as foes;
When Anarchy threatened
And Order withdrew,
They rallied to rescue
The Red, White and Blue!
  They rallied to rescue
  The Red, White and Blue!

4. Upholding our banner,
On many afield,
The doom of the trairor
They valiantly sealed. ;
And, worn with the conflict,
Found vigor anew,
Where victory greeted
The Red, White and Blue!
  Where victory greeted
  The Red, White and Blue!

5. Yet, loved ones have fallen
And still, where they now,
And chaplets unfading
Shall blind ev’ry sleep,
A sorrowing Nation
Shall silently weep;
And Spring’s fairest flowers,
In gratitude, strew,
O’er those who have cherished
The Red, White and Blue!
  O’er those who have cherished
  The Red, White and Blue!

6. But, glory immortal
Is waiting them sleep,
And chaplets unfading
Shall blind ev’ry brow;
When call’d by the trumpet
At time’s great review,
They stand, who defended
The Red, White and Blue!
  They stand, who defended
  The Red, White and Blue!
