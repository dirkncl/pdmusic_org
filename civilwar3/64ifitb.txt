1.
I've fallen in the battle
My thoughts are all with thee;
Amid the cannon's rattle
Thy spirit comes to me.
Oh mother I am dying
Upon this battle plain;
My pulses fast are flying;
We ne'er shall meet again.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I fought for right and freedom,
Beside the noble brave;
Before disgrace of country,
Oh, let me have the grave.

2.
Oh tell me lovely sister,
That in my dying hour,
I sadly, sadly missed her
Sweet tunes a magic pow'r.
Her eye will miss me, mother,
When gallantly shall come,
The troops without her brother
Back to their village home.

3.
And yet there is another
With soul lit eye of blue
I love not as a brother--
That maid so fond and true,
Down by the brookside mother
No more we'll ever roam
With hand in hand together,
Beside her cottage home.

4.
To me at our last meeting
While trembling on my breast,
With heart all mildly beating
She gave this golden tress;
Oh take it to her mother,
And say that ever more
My spirit shall be with her
On earth by sea or shore.
