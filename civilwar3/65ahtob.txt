1. All hail to our banner, the emblem of glory,
The beacon in battle, the herald of right,
The pride of our fathers in song and in story,
The sunbeam of freedom, to tyranny’s night.
Beneath its proud folds brave thousands have trod,
Bearing death to rebellion, and freedom to slaves,
The hosts of Columbia the army of God,
Have swept away darkness, where ever it waves.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let it float to the breeze as we’re marching along,
On land and on seas as we’re marching along,
To glory and victory, to glory on to victory.

2. All hail to our banner that waves on in triumph
Has hurled back oppression in wreck and dispair,
Torn from Sumter’s proud walls, untarnished unfurled,
The spot it first hallowed, it floats proudly there:
Baptised in the blood of a million brave hearts.
It now mounfully droops o’er our patriots’ green gaves,
Yet martyrs to FREEDOM still watch o’er our land,
And bless that bright banner where ever it waves.

3. All hail to our banner still proudly wave o’er us.
Bless’d be thy mission of truth from above,
May all the world honor thy bright stars of promise
The emblem of Liberty, union and love.
May Peace bless our land with its loved form again,
And our shores no more echo the tread of the slave,
But freedom and justice and holiness reign,
Whereever in glory that banner shall wave.
