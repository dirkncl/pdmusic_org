[NOTE: S=Secesh(ionist?); Y=Yankee]
1. [S]Hallo! you Yankee renegade, you mudsill of a cricket!
Take off your hat, and make a bow to a confed’rate picket.
[Y]So yeou’re one of the Sothern bloods that’s talking ’beout secession,
Yeou look just like the fag end of a funeral procession.
[S]O you weazen hatchet face,
How I hate the Yankee race!
[Y]Yes you’d bury me to day if it was handy!
[S]It will surely be your doom,
’Less you now skedaddle home,
For I hate the name of Yankee doodle dandy!
[Y]Yes you hate the name of Yankee doodle dandy.

2. [Y]Say heow’s your marm, yeou South’rn sprig, and heow’s your chronometer!
Perhaps yeou don’t like Yankee guns, nor eour iron Monitor.
[S]Well tho’ for you I must confess, I have a hearty loathing.
I wish we had more of your guns, and more of Yankee clothing.
[Y]Won’t you please to state to me,
Heow’s your sugar in your tea!
Dont yeou find it rather troublesome and sandy!
[S]It is vain for you to brag,
For I’ll never raise your flag.
For I hate the name of Yankee doodle dandy!
[Y]Yes you hate the name of Yankee doodle dandy.

3. [S]Our country’s suffered so from war ’tis past the reuniting,
And well ye know, ye menial hound, for Liberty we’re fighting!
[Y]Well neow, I don’t know no such thing, jest cut down them ere figures,
Yeou’re fightin’ that yeou’re ’ristocrats may multiply their niggers!
[S]Well its worth my weight in gold,
To be standing here in cold,—
[Y]While yeou’re officers are drinking up the brandy.
[S]Ah! I’m yearning nor for bread
’Tis so long since I was fed,
[Y]Well then come and eat with Yankee doodle dandy,
[S]Yes you’ve food enough in Yankee doodle dandy.

4. [S]Well after all you must confess— altho’ we’re short of ration,
We have our servants at our call, which gives us pride and station!
[Y]Well yes yeou all for vittles wait, and so yeou’ve lots of waiters,
But why should yeou be proud o’ that, for where’s yeour bread and tataters!
[Y]O my gnawing appetite,
Proves to me that you are right
[Y]Then fly to Abram’s bosom neow so handy,
[S]Well I’ll raise the nation’s flag
And I’ll drop the rebel fag,
And I’ll shout aloud for Yankee doodle dandy!
[Y]Yes— come shout aloud for Yankee doodle dandy.

5. [Y]Well neow my honest South’rn friend, since yeou have been converted,
Let’s try eour hands on Nothern sneaks that treuth have long perverted!
[S]Don’t ask me, sir, to act with men whose love for truth has soured,
I hate the sneak who cries for peace because he is a coward!
[Y]Like a joke of Uncle Abe’s
[S]We will treat ’em all as babes,
[Y]And we’ll give to each a little stick of candy!
[S]Their disease is growing worse,
Then we’ll put ’em eout to nurse,
And we’ll make ’em sing old Yankee doodle dandy!
[Y]Yes we’ll make them sing old Yankee doodle dandy.

[DUET 1]
