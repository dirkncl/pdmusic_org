1. We smooth’d down the locks of her soft golden hair, 
And folded her arms on her breast, 
And laid her at eve in the valley so fair, 
’Mid the blossoms of summer to rest.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh rest, Minnie rest, no care can assail, 
For green grows the turf 
O’er the tear moistened grave 
Of the fairest flower of the vale.

2. She sleep ’neath the spot she had marked for repose,
Where the flowers first blossom in spring,
And the zephyrs breathe the perfume of the rose,
And the birds come at ev’ning to sing.

3. The wide spreading boughs of the old chestnut tree
Bend low o’er the place where she lies;
There the eve’s purple beams longest glow on the rose,
And the moon drinks the dews as they rise.

4. Alone where the brook murmurs soft on the air,
She sleeps with the turf on her breast,
As we laid her at eve in the valley so fair,
’Mid the blossoms of summer to rest.
