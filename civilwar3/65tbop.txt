1. Oh sweet is the sound of the shuttle and loom,
When the lilies of peace fill the land with perfume!
Then cheerily echoes the axe from the hill,
And the bright waters sing on the wheel of the mill;
And the anvil rings out like a bell through the day,
And the wagoner’s song cheers his team on the way.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
’Till the bugle’s sound here, and the drums rattle there,
And the banners of war stream afar on the air.
Be God on our side in the season of dreqd.
Be His strength with the living,
His peace with the dead,
His love shield the widow and orphans,
His care soothe the parents whose sorrow shall whiten their hair;
Be success with the right when the struggle is through,
And the sword he returned to the plowshare anew,
And no bugle sound here, and no drum rattle there,
While the banners of peace stream afar on the air,
While the banners of peace stream afar on the air.

2. Our brave hearted yeomen, our loards of the sail,
They reap where they saw the reward of their toil,
In the broad field of labor their harvest is blithe,
Their favorite arms the plow, sickle and scythe,
The plow, and the sickle, the scythe and the flail,
These, these are their weapons with these they prevail.
