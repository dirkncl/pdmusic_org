1. How sleep the brave, who sank to rest,
By all their country’s wishes bless’d;
When Spring with dewy fingers cold,
Returns to deck their hallowed mould,
She there shall dress a sweeter sod,
Than Fancy’s feet have ever trod.

2. By fairy hands their knell is rung;
By forms unseen their dirge is sung;
There Honour comes as pilgrims gray,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay
And Freedom shall awhile repair
To dwell a weeping hermit there.
