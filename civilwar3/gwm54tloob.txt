1. The land of our birthplace! where e’er it may be, 
If it is but the land of the brave and the free. 
It matters not whether it boast of a name 
That is ancient, or new ’maid the annals of fame. 
And although it may be our lot perhaps to part 
From the house of our fathers. Still dear to the heart 
Are those scents of our youth, where hours flow away 
In merriment past with the sportive and gay;

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Bless the land of our birthplace where e’er it may be 
If it is but the land of the brave and the free.

[CHORUS sung after each REFRAIN]
Bless the land of our birthplace where e’er it may be, 
If it is but the land of the brave and the free.

2. That land of our glory, our pride and our boast 
Where lov’d ones lie sleeping Ah! friends we lov’d most 
Whether mountain or valley or desert or wild, 
There oft have we wander’d, and lov’d as a child 
What ever the failings or faults it possess, 
Its ties and old friendships are nevertheless. 
And dear is our mem’ry the free and the brave, 
Who fought and who died their lov’d country to save;
