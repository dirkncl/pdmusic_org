1. The war is over, darling Kate,
  And angel Peace again shall reign;
Though weary years we had to wait,
  ’Twill sweeter be to meet again.
I know that you’ll be proud of me,
  Though I must wear an empty sleeve;
They told me that you wept to see,
  The list of wounded and did grieve.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The war is over darling Kate,
  And I am coming back to thee,
Our country now is free and great,
  And thou art constrant love to me.

2. I long to greet you as of old,
  Before I went to meet the foe,
When we so oft together strolled,
  And talked in accents deep and low.
For it will be so sweet to feet,
  Thy loving heart beat high for me
To see thy deep blue eyes reveal
  Thy love and tender sympathy.

3. O yes dear love, the war is o’er,
  Our foes have been compelled to yield;
I’ll bring to thee the flag I bore
  O’er many a bloody battle field
And when the cheering cry rang out,
  “Behold the traitors how they flee.”
Though bleeding then I raised the shout,
  And waved the banner of the free.
