1. Way down in South Car’lina State,
  In Uncle Sam’s domains;
A naughty child called Dixie lived,
  Who lacked sufficient brains.
He had been fed on PUBLIC PAP,
  ’Till he had saucy grown;
So thought he’d start a Government
  And have it all his own.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
How is it now Britannia
  The game you’ve surely lost?
You’ll have to settle shortly
  So better count the cost.

2. Then meddlesome Britania came,
  To make the matter worse,
And naughty little Dixie took
  Unto her arms to nurse;
He thrived a while, and grew to be,
  A pretty good sized boy,
And nurse Britania looked on him
  And watched his growth with joy.

3. Britannia was quite jealous of
  Her neighbor Uncle Sam,
So full of wicked thoughts did she,
  The head of Dixie cram,
She nursed him well, until she thought,
  He large enough had grown,
To try the hard experriment
  Of standing all alone.

4. She built him many pretty ships,
  With which to sail the sea,
And taught him how to rob, and play
  The game of Piracy
Of swords and rifles, shot and shell,
  She gave him quite a store,
And took his worthless Cotton Bonds
  For twice as many more.

5. Good natured Uncle Sam looked on,
  Until he could not stand
The noise and trouble Dixie made,
  Within his peaceful land.
And whe HE gets HIS dander up
  You’d better all stand clear,
He has a temper, which we know
  All Europe’s monarchs fear.

6. Then stretching forth his strong right arm
  He gave the boy a whack,
Which dislocated ev’ry bone
  In naughty Dixie’s back
And all that marks the fatal spot
  Where little Dixie fell,
Is bonnet, boots, a pair of spurs,
  HoopSkirt and Balmoral.
