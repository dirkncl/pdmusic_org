1.
I'm a broken-hearted milkman, in grief I'm arrayed,
Through keeping of the company of a young servant maid,
Who [never?] on board wager, the [brave?] to keep clean,
In a gentleman's fam'ly, near Abington Green.
Oh! she was as ...

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Beautiful as a butterfly, and as proud as a queen,
Was pretty little Polly Perkins, of Abington Green.

2.
Her eyes were as black as the pipe of a pear.
No rose in the garden with her cheeks could compare,
Her hair hung in "zingerlets" so beautiful and long,
I thought that she lov'd me, but found I was wrong.
Oh! she was as ...

When I'd rattle in a morning, and say "milk below,"
At the sound of my milk cats her face she would show,

If I thought she'd have lov'd me, I'd have laid down to die,

A chariot to ride in, and be handsome and bold;
His hair must be curly as any watch-spring,
And his whiskers as big as a brush for clothing."
Oh! she was as ...

6.
The words that she utter'd went straight through my heart,
I wobled, I sigh-ed and straight did depart
With a tear in my eyelid as big as a bean,
Bidding good bye to Polly and Abington Green.
Ah! she was as ...

7.
In six months she married---this hard-hearted girl,
But it was not a 'Vineyard,' and it was not a 'Pearl,'
It was not a '[Darmite?],' but a shade or two '[ws.?]'
'Twas a bow-legg'd Conductor of a Two-penny ['Bore]
In spite of all she was ...
