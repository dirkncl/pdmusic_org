1. Comrades known in marches many.
Comrades tried in dangers many,
Comrades bound in memories many.
Brothers ever let us be!
Wounds or sickness may divide us,
Marching orders may divide us,
But whatever fate betide us,

CHORUS 1
Brothers of the heart are we!
Brothers of the heart are we!

2. Comrades, known by faith the clearest,
Tried when death was near and nearest,
Bound are we by ties the dearest.
Brothers  ever more to  be—
And, if spared and growing older,
Shoulder still in line with shoulder,
And with hearts no thrill the colder,

CHORUS 2
Brothers  ever we shall be!
Brothers  ever we shall be!

3. By communuion of  the banner.
Battle scarred but victor banner,
By the baptism of the banner.
Brothers of on church are we!
Creed nor faction can divvide us,
Race nor language can divide us,
Still, whatever fate betide us,

CHORUS 3
Children of the flag are we!
Children  of the flag are we!
