1. I cannot leave the battlefield,
I cannot come to thee,
Till ’neath our flag the traitors yield
And all our foemen flee,
When victory shall crown with light
Our banner of the air,
I’ll seek my home with true delight,
To dwell in sweet joy there.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
When victory shall crown with light
Our banner of the air,
I’ll seek me home with true delight,
To dwell in sweet joy there.

2. I stand where falls the deadly rain
Where brave men proudly die,
That our old flag may float again
Triumphant in the sky,
Where in the hand the gleaming steel
Is flashing at the van,
Where gallant legions proudly wheel,
To die as heroes can.

3. I cannot come loved one, to thee
Till peace shall smile again,
O’er all our land, from sea to sea,
O’er mountain, vale and plain;
Then bid me and return, till all
We love is safe from harm,
But pray that God on whom we call
Will guide our willing arm.
