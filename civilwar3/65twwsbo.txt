1. See! oh! see! the clouds arising, 
And the time is drawing near. 
Over yonder, in the southward, 
There the dawn will first appear. 
’Way down among the cane brakes,  
Where poor darkey used to hoe; 
There upon the old plantation, 
Where the cotton used to grow.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Don’t you see, O, don’t you see it! 
Over yonder, rising slow. 
The cloud is breaking in the southward, 
And the war will soon be o’er!
The cloud is breaking in the southward, 
And the war will soon be o’er!

2. Masa getting verry weary, 
Looking for the war to cease. 
We have left the old plantation, 
And are steering for the east. 
For his wealth is nearly squandered, 
And his lands have run to waste; 
Jeff is looking up a packet, 
And is going to leave the place.

3. Now upon the old plantation, 
Where the cotton will soon be grow, 
Massa gone to be a soldier, 
And the campfire’s burning low. 
No more the darlies hear the blowing, 
That used to call at early dawn, 
When the Yankees stormed the fortress, 
Then they broke old Massa’s horn.

4. If you look a little lower, 
The horison will soon be clear, 
And the war will soon be over, 
For the time is drawing near. 
And we know that God  has promised, 
To set the slave, the bondman free, 
Then we’ll raise the starry banner, 
And we’ll have a jubilee.
