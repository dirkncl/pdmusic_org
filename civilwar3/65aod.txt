1. I am dreaming, am dreaming of thee, love,
While afar I am roving at night,
And like stars asleep o’er the sea, love,
My emotions are sparkling and bright:
In my mind on thy features I gaze, love,
’Til my soul on thy gentle eye beams,
Floats away in so rosy a haze, love,
That I call thee my Angel of Dreams,
  Floats away in so rosy a haze, love,
  That I call thee my Angel of Dreams.

2. O! the world it may smile or may frown, love,
As a trifle, its changes I deem,
All of care and of sorrow I drown, love,
As so softly and sweetly I dream:
For the moonlight alone, I now pine, love,
For the moon which will smile upon me,
When thou wilt be mine, only mine, love,
Until then I am dreaming of thee,
  When thou wilt be mine, only mine, love,
  Until then I am dreaming of thee.
