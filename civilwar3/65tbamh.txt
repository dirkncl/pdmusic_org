1. Hear the tramp of armies,
  On the distant plain,
Now the war is over,
  Coming home again;
See the banners streaming,
  On the victors come,
Swell the shouts of victory,
  The boys are marching home!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hark! the drums are beating,
Shout the loud huzza!
Hear the soldiers tramping,
Coming from the war!
See the banners streaming,
On the victors come,
Swell the shout of victory,
The boys are marching home.

2. Far away in Dixie
  They the foe have met,
Noble deeds of valor,
  We will not forget;
Strew the path with flowers,
  Hail the heroes on,
Swell the shout of welcome,
  The boys are marching home!

3. Now the fight is over,
  Peace will come again,
Union boys have conquered,
  On the bloody plain;
Welcome to the fireside,
  Never more to roam,
With victory and Union,
  The boys are marching home!
