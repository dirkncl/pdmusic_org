1.
There’s an old battered friend swinging close at my side,
Whose fate has with mine for long years been allied,
He’s not handsome to view, as may plainly be seen,
Yet I well know its merits— my faithful canteen.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O, my old battered friend, as you swing by my side,
I cannot forget that we both have been tried,
And though sometimes found wanting you never were seen
Attached to a coward, my brave old canteen.

2.
In the march, in the glare of a summer’s hot sun
When worn with the weight of the knapsack and gun,
Oh ’twas pleasant to halt ’neath the sheltering green,
And find a cool drop in the cheering canteen.

3.
At night, on the picket, when darkness came down,
And shut out the stars with its blackening frown,
When the rain chilled the marrow, still, still there has been
A lifegiving warmth in the friendly Canteen.

4.
When gathered in tent, tired, dusty and worn,
Expecting the foe ere the breaking of morn,
More refreshing was sleep, those few moments I ween,
When it followed a draft from the hearty Canteen.

5.
And then, when we look on the oncoming foe,
And knew that for us or for them there was woe,
Ere we rushed where would soon be a bloodsprinkled scene,
New courage we found in the gallant Canteen.

6.
But my comrades, you know, we have sometimes abused
The means which for good should alone have been used;
And too oft have been found in a state called ‘between,’
From loving too fondly the charming Canteen.
