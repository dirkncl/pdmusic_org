Song & Chorus

"Bear this gently to my Mother,
  Tell her that it came from me;
'Tis the little lock she cherished,
  And I trust it now with thee,
Bear it to her comrade kindly,
  For an angel soon I'll be;
You shall share my latest blessing,--
  You were always kind to me."

1. “Bear this gently to my mother,”
  Tell her that it came from me;
’Tis the little lock she cherished,
  And I trust it now with thee.
Bear it to her, comrade, kindly,
  For an angel soon I’ll be;
You shall share my latest blessing—
  You were always kind to me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Bear this gently to my mother,
  ’Tis the boon I crave of thee—
You shall share my latest blessing,
  You were always kind to me.

2. If you see the maid I cherish
  Tell her that I fought and fell;
That my love shall never perish,
  Tho’ I now must say “farewell.”
Tell her we shall meet in heaven,
  Where there is no care or pain;
Tho’ on earth our hearts must sever,
  We must meet yet meet again.

3. “Bear this gently to my mother,”
  Kiss my dear old wrinkled brow;
Kiss my sister and my brother,
  Say “he is an angel now.”
Kiss the little maid I cherish,
  Dry her tears and smoothe her hair;
Tell her soon to come and meet me
  In yon starry heavens there.
