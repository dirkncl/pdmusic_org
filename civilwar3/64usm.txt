"So wide spread was treason, so faithless the President,
that all hope was exhausted except the single one that
his term would expire before all war was lost. Thank God!
Abraham Lincoln became President before the cause of
the Union was totally ruined, and then the work of
rescue began."--Moorehead.

1. I’d like to have you all to know 
That I, that I 
Am going to have a litle show, 
And try, and try 
To raise some cash in shape of votes, 
To buy my quadrupeds some oats, 
And you’ll all get a peep at them, 
When next November comes.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then come with your cash ev’ry one, 
But don’t bring Confederate notes, 
For Greenbacks you’ll see lots of fun, 
But I much prefer loyal votes.

2. I’d have the man who caught the ass, 
They say, they say, 
While grazing on the mountain pass, 
One day, one day: 
He brings him here to show his wool, 
And try it o’er your eyes to pull, 
But you will all have a good time, 
When I bring out my show. 

3. I’ll have that man of wondrous fame,
George B., George B.
George Blunder I would call his name,
Would ye? Would ye?
Before Yorktown he beat his drums,
But was afraid of wooden guns;
But still, upon a dress­parade,
He was a splendid man.

4. I’ll have that little cunning fox
From Ohio,
I’ll keep him in a dry goods box,
You know, you know.
He stands, I think, just four feet high,
He has a serpent’s tongue and eye;
But I’'ll take care he does not bite,
For well I know he’ll try.

5. I’ll also have his great colleague,
A. Long, A. Long,
Who with the De’il had form’d a league
Quite strong, quite strong,
Till Colfax drove the De’il away,
And Long, dishonor’d, left to stay,
To see the great Fernando Wood
And Harris go marching home.

6. To manage all I have the man
Of rails, or rails,
To make them shake (I know he can)
Their tails, their tails.
And when you all have seen my show,
To Washington I’m bound to go,
And leave old Father Abraham
To manage for four years.
