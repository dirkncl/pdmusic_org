1. One summer eve, with pensive thought,
I wander’d on the seabeat shore,
Where oft in heedless infant sport
I gather’d shells in days before,
I gather’d shells in days before.
The splashing waves like musis fell,
Respomsive to me fancy wild,
A dream come o’er me like a spell,
I thought I was again a child,
A dream came o’er me like a spell,
I thought I was again, again a child.

2. I stood upon the pebbly strand
To cull the toys that ’round me lay,
But as I took them in my hand,
I threw them one by one away,
I threw them one by one away:
Oh! thus I said in ev’ry stage
By toys our fancy is beguiled,
We gather Shells from youth to age
And then we leave them like a child.
We gather Shells from youth to age
And then we leave them like a child.
