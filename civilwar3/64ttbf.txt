1.
In front by the color sargeant borne,
Is the battle flag that each loves well,
Grimy with battle smoke and torn,
By the whistling bullet and bursting shell;
||: And long and loud the people cheer,
    At sight of the flag that each hold dear. :||

2.
Its stars were once of a glittering gold
On a field of glorious azure bright,
Of newest silk was each shining fold,
With stripe of crimson and purest white,
||: And delicate hands of women made
    The women tassel and corded braid. :||

3.
Ah, through what scences [scenes?] of strife since then
Has that tattered battle flag been borne!
What meaning is there to these valiant men
In each fluttering temnant stained and torn!
||: And proudly they follow it up the street,
    While the shrill fifes scream and the loud drums beat. :||

4.
It tells of marches through wind and rain,
In the summer heat and the solemn night;
It tells of a gallant comrade slain,
Who bore it safely in many a fight--
||: Of the sudden skirmish where brave men bled,
    Of the battle field with its gory bed. :||

5.
And now they have brought it home at last,
Though black with the battle's smoke and torn--
What takes it well tell of the stirring past,
In future years to the child unborn,
||: When gazing mute, at the arsenal wall,
    His eye on that tattered flag shall fall! :||

6.
Beat, beat, ye drums, still louder beat!
Play fifes, with shriller, merrier sound!
Roll out, oh drum, along the street,
Till trembles all the solid ground!
||: And cheer ye people long and louder cheer
    For the brave old flag that your hearts hold dear! :||
