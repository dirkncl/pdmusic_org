"Oh, send me one Flower
from his Grave" [18 Feb 1865; 5 May 1865]
Ballad
and Chorus

While the merry birds sing in the low branches near
  And above him the green willows wave;
Still warm with the sunshine and wet with the dew,
  Oh, send me one flower from his grave.

1. They tell me the valley is smiling and fair,
  Where the form of my boy lies asleep,
That the merry birds sing in the low branches near,
  While I sit in my chamber and weep,
To God and my country for weal or for woe,
  This pledge of affection I gave;
And now he has fallen, I ask in return,
  One sweet simple flow’r from his grave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
While the merry birds sing in the low branches near,
  And above him the green willows wave,
Still warm with the sunshine, and wet with the dew,
  Oh, send me one flower from his grave.

2. The morning he left me how noble he looked,
  As he bade me adieu on the strand,
And how proud of her boy was this poor mother’s heart
  As I kissed his warm tears from my hand!
“We fight for the flag, dearest Mother,” he said,
  “Our flag that the rebels defy;
And now boys, three cheers for the Banner we love,
  We’ll save it from shame, or we’ll die.

3. One blossom, tho’ withered, how precious ’twill be,
  That has bloom’d near that fair sunny head;
But one dear little flow’ret, tho’ trampled and crushed,
  That has grown o’er my darling’s lone bed,
My days are declining and life’s golden sun
  Will set soon forever to me,
But still that green mound I shall see in my dreams,
  Till my spirit from sorrow is free!
