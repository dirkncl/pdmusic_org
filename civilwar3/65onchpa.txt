1.
Our noble Chief has pass’d away!
His form is lying still and cold,
And hearts that bore the bloom of May
Dark sorrow’s wings in gloom enfold.
A great and mighty Nation mourns!
We bless his lov’d and honor’d name,
O brighter than a million dawns
For evermore shall be his fame!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We weep for him, we weep for him!
But far along the years to be,
Shall gleam with rays that none may dim,
His glorious Immortality!

2. Now calmly moulder in the dust
The gentle heart, the kindly hand,--
And purpose ever true and just,
That Freedom gave to all our land!
Our Father hear a Nation’s pray’r
And shield his loving ones who mourn!
O heal the bruised hearts they bear,
And from the darkness wake the dawn!
