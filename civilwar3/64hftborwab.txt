1. Hurrah for the banner of Red, White and Blue,
To the proud flag of stars, we will ever by true;
The black hearted traitors, the dark day shall rue,
When they spurned our brave banner, the Red, White and Blue.
When forced to leave our own Green Isle
To seek ahome, on the strangers’s soil.
Its gleaming stars and rainbow bars
In welcome floated o’er us.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then hurrah for the banner of Red, White and Blue,
Three cheers for the banner of Red, White and Blue,
And a cheer for old Ireland and Liberty too,
God bless our proud banner of Red, White and blue.

2. By Clontarf’s princely glories, that never will die;
By the heroic mem’ries of famed Fontency,
By each battle field where the wild Irish cry;
Rang out the proud watchword we’ll conquer or die.
By brave Montgomery’s patriot name,
By Warren’s blood McDonough’s fame,
We raise the cry, to  live and die,
For Liberty and Union.

3. ’Twas said we were false when we swore to be true,
That we would’nt “Cotton” to the Red, White and Blue;
That we couldn’t love Ireland and America too
That we would “recede” from the Red, White and Blue.
Ring out our old wild Irish cry;
Fling out the Starry flag on high;
Beneath its folds we’ll do or die,
For Liberty and Union.
