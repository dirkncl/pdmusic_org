Hurrah! then for Peace, my brave comrades and brothers,

Three cheers for our sisters, our wives, and our mothers,
We're coming again to the dear ones at home!

1. Hurrah! comrades all have you heard the glad tidings, 
That came on the wings of the winds from afar? 
There’ll soon be an end to our tramps and our ridings, 
A truce to our strife and an end of the war, 
O! welcome sweet dove, then, the Olive Branch bearing, 
No longer o’er fields of fell carnage to roam; 
Hope lumines the future, the end we are nearing, 
We’re coming again to the dear ones at home. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah! then for peace, my brave comrades and brothers, 
Raise, raise your glad shouts to the Heaven’s blue dome, 
Three cheers! for our sisters, our wives, and our mothers, 
We’re coming again to the dear ones at home.

2. Farewell to the crack of the musket and rifles, 
Farewell to the death-deading cannon’s loud boom, 
To all that our better emotions would stifle, 
And keep us away from the dear ones at home. 
Farewell to night sleepless, and long weary marching, 
O’er mountains and valleys [umrvsted?] to roam, 
Farewell to the dust clouds our thirsty throats parching, 
We’re coming again to the dear ones at home. 

3. Hurrah! for the Flag we’ve so bravely defended, 
And borne on the field in the death dealing strife, 
Though in the fierce struggles its folds have been rended, 
Each thread is as dear to our hearts as our life. 
No more on the field shall its presence inspire us, 
And Heirloom, a treasure for ages to come, 
With love and devotion its glory shall fire us, 
We’ll bear it with pride to the dear ones at home.
