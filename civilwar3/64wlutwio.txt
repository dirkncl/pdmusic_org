"Wait Love Until the War Is Over" (1864)
Song and Chorus

"Twas gentle eve, the stars were bright,
  All nature hushed, seemed lovely.
I wandered in the moon’s pale light,'
  With the maid I loved so fondly.
Our vows renewed -- our spirits free,
  Our hearts with joy ran over;
But ah! a sad smile said to me,
  "Wait love, until the war is over."

1.
'Twas gentle eve, the stars were bright,
  All nature hushed, seemed lonely;
I wandered in the moon’s pale light,
  With the maid I loved so fondly.
Our vows renewed, our spirits free,
  Our hearts with joy ran over;
But ah! a sad smile said to me,
  “Wait love until the war is over.”

CHORUS 1
Wait love, wait love, wait love, until the war is over,
Wait love, wait love, wait love until the war is over. 


2.
I left my home— Oh! who can tell,
  The anguish felt at parting
With those whose tears like raindrops fell
  Upon their boy when starting!
I longed with ardent hopes to fly
  To her whose prayers still hover
Around my couch and waking sigh,
  Would love that the war were over.

CHORUS 2
Wait love, wait love, wait love, until the war is over,
Wait love, wait love, wait love until the war is over. 

3.
Oh sad it was to leave the form,
  Of her I loved with madness;
Yet I hastened to the battle storm,
  The foe to meet with gladness.
And Oh! at night with heart set free,
  When the day’s long fight was over,
In dreams she seemed to say to me—
  “Hope love, the war will soon be over.”

CHORUS 3
Hope love, hope love, hope, for the war will soon be over
Hope love, hope love, hope love, the war will soon be over. 

4.
Sweet joyous peace beams o’er our land,
  Our foes their flight have taken,
I hasten with a wealth of love
  To the promised one awaiting.
Her face is bright, from sadness free,
  With radiance beaming over—
I hear her sweet voice say to me,
  “Come love, for now the war is over!”

CHORUS 4
Come love, come love, come love, for now the war is over
Come love, come love, come love, for now the war is over.
