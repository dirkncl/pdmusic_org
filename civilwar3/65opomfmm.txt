1. O pray once more for me, mother,
Pray once more for me,
For I am dying now, mother,
O so far from thee.
O send thy love to me, mother
Swift on the wings of prayer.
Let me feel its glow, mother,
Round me in the air.
What to me the battle shout,
Or death’s icy stare.
I fear them out, I die content,
Blest by a mother’s prayer.
The dearest gift a soldier hath,
It is a mother’s prayer.

2. O do not grieve for me, mother,
What can grief avail,
It will not make me well, mother,
Now so weak and pale.
A little while to wait, mother
And you shall see again.
Him who now you mourn, mother,
Risen from the slain!
Words too pure for mortals here,
Shall be spoken there,
The best of all the angels keep,
Shall be a mother’s prayer,
O dearest sainted boon to me,
Thou art a mother’s prayer.

3. Amid the clang of arms, mother,
Victory is there;
The sullen foe cannot, mother,
Storm a mother’s prayer.
The foe! they break! they run! mother
Ah! this was all he said;
Now the sighing pines, mother,
Mourn thy darling dead!
Who so old as fear the foe
Hero boys are there
They cleave the hostile battlements
Down with a mother’s prayer,
They cleave the hostile battlements
Down with a mother’s prayer.
