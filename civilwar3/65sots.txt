1. Eyes of beauty, throng’d around thee
  Gaze upon thee, Spoon, to night.
Upidee, upidee,
upida, upida,
upidee, upida
  upidee, upida.
  In thy presence all our hearts
  Are full of mercy, mad delight.
Upidee, upidee,
upida, upida,
upidee, upida
  upidee, upida.

But another year together,
And with faces sad and pale,
We must leave thee, and whatever
We have held most dear at Yale. 

[NOTE the exact placement of this verse is not clear in the source]
2. Scatter flowers, scatter laughter,
  In his path who bears the Spoon:
Upidee, upidee,
upida, upida,
upidee, upida
  upidee, upida.

  And around him ever after,
  Still shall ring the merry tune.
Upidee, upidee,
upida, upida,
upidee, upida
  upidee, upida.

  Smile upon him, fairest of the fair;
  Let your beauty rare
  Grace the peerless boon;
Brightest, dearest, noblest treasure, noblest treasure Wooden Spoon.
  And an honor shall it ever
  Be to him, the highest, best,
  ’Till our college bond shall sever,
  And the parting hand be pressed.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Laugh, be merry, merry, merry June;
Kind, benignant June; jolly jolly June
To her children gives the noble, gives the noble Wooden Spoon.
  to her children gives the noble, noble Wooden Spoon.
Blessings ever be upon thee,
On thy honest, wooden face,
Strangely carven, mystic meanings
Shadow from thy stately grace.
upidee, upida
upidee, upida.

While the wave shocks
Madly the rocks.
Drops fall in spray.
Jewels are they
In the robes of night,
In the locks of storms
Making darkness bright,
Lighting our way.

Then the dark, fearful wave,
Sailors’ home, sailors’ grave,
Seem to glow with delight,
And it shines in pleasant mem’ries
Through the night.
Thus through our days,
When the waves beat high.
And our souls reply
In one constant tune,
Still shall it cheer,
Looking back upon
Mem’ries held so dear,
Wreathing the spoon.

Spoon,
Spoon,
Spoon,
Spoon.

Other voices merrily will sing
Thee a very King.
Till the startled moon
Yields her homage to the noble, to the noble Wooden
  Yields her homage to the noble, noble Wooden
Spoon.
Through the ages, ever dearer,
Shall thy glory move along.
And forever louder, clearer,
Shall thy praises swell the song.
Upidee, upida, upidee, upida.
Wooden Spoon, Wooden Spoon,
Wooden Spoon, Wooden Spoon,
Wooden Spoon, Wooden Spoon,
Spoon, Spoon, Spoon, Spoon,
Wooden Spoon.
