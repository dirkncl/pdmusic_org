1.
All hail to our triumph, ye loyal, ye true--
All hail to the morn of Columbia's proud day;
The foeman is humbled, and traitors undone,
Have yielded the contest to Liberty's sway.
Long years have we waited for terrors to cease,
And pray'd that the hour of deliv'rance might come;
The contest is over--the bright dawn of Peace
Is hail'd with delight the "Many in One."

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then hail to our triumph, ye loyal, ye true--
All hail to the glorious victory won;
Fling our the old Banner--the Red, White, the Blue--
The emblem of Union, and "Many in One."

2.
With joy for the living, with tears for the dead,
We welcome again the glad morning of peace;
First day of Millenium, from ages foretold,
When conflicts and tumults forever shall cease,
We'll raise up the marble, though made it will tell
The deeds of renown that our "Brave Boys" have done;
Oh, dear are their names, and the fields where they fell
Will live in the mem'ry of "Many in One."

3.
We'll honor the heroes who've conquer'd the foe,
And giv'n us our glorious Union again;
"In God," is our motto--Heav'n smiles on us now,
And, united as one, we will ever remain.
We follow'd our "chosen one" through the long war.
And wept like his children when God call'd him home;
His spirit hovers o'er us and joins in the song
That tells of the triumph of "Many in One."
