1. Dear Mother I must bid adieu, 
And to the war must go; 
Yes, mother I must part with you, 
And meet the tyrant foe. 
The Drums are beating o’er the hill, 
The foemen are in sight; 
The Cannons loudly echo still, 
We’ll for the Union fight.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The Drums are beating o’er the hill, 
The foemen are in sight; 
The cannons loudly echo still, 
We’ll for the Union fight.

2. Yet, stay my boys you cannot go,
Thy youth, calls forth my care;
For thy two elder brothers fell,
Amidst the savage snare;
Now mother when I’m away,
Remember me to Sue,
And when amidst the battle fray,
I’ll strike a blow for you.

3. Go now my boy and ne’er return,
Until the war is o’er;
My bosom doth with anguish burn,
I ne’er may see thee more;
Yet stay my boy— before you go
Thy Mother’s blessing take,
For e’re thy meet the falling foe
While dearest for thy sake.
