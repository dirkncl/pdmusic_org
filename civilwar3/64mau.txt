1. Come Brothers arouse! there is War in the Land, 
For our Country and Laws let us make a bold stand! 
Against Faction and Treason, come, rise in our might, 
And to crush the foul wrong we will strength en the right.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
McClellan the Soldier, MeClellan the Brave, 
McClellan the Stateman our Country will save, 
We will flock to his Standard three million times three, 
And the Head of the Nation McClellan shall be!

2. Should the Union be severed woe, woe is our lot,
’Mid the proud and the mighty our Nation’s a blot!
But the Union must prosper pure, happy and free
When the Head of the Nation McClellan shall be.

3. We must put down all foes from within and without,
Come they from the East, West, North or South,—
[Spoken: Yes, all! including the “Monroe Doctrine!”]
To each Law of the Nation we’ll firmly adhere,
That from childhood to age, we’ve been taugh to revere!

4. Come with hands frirm and true and with hearts in the cause,
To strike for our loved Constitution and Laws;
And the zeal for our Country no languor shall know,
While we float the Old Banner and press the fierce foe!
