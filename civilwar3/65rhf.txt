1. Richmond has fallen!
Hurrah! boys, hurrah!
Old Jeff and his traitors
Have skedaddled afar;
They’d better “go to Halifax”
Or some other place,
For the Yankee boys are after them,
And won’t give up the chase!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Richmond has fallen!
Hurrah boys, hurrah!
Old Jeff and his traitors
Have skedaddled afar!

2. Grant and his heroes
Stormed the rebel town,
Showed them the Stars and Stripes
Felled the traitors down!
He marched in triumpantly,
And hoisted our flag,
And from the rebel Capitol
“Doused” the secesh rag!

3. Richmond has fallen
“Old Ben” had the key;
His eye wan so crooked
The hole he could not see;
Then Grant, he came marching down,
And gave a thund’ring knock,
He didn’t wait to try the key,
But broke the rebel lock:
