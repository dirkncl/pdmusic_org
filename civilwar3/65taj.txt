1. The joyous bells loud ringing—
  The cannon’s thund’ring roar—
Sound victory and Union,
  With Peace from shore to shore!
The Nation’s fame and freedom,
  By Slavery assail’d,
Triumphant over treason—
  Triumphant in the field.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Freedom’s Flag now floats aloft,
  Our Eagles proudly soar!
Secession and vile Slavery
  Shall curse the land no more!
Confederate Treason vanish’d,
  Like foul and fitful dream—
The Great Republic triumphs,
  And Freedom reigns supreme!

2. Fierce war and desolation—
  Long years of bloody strife—
Are ended now triumphantly—
  The NATION GAINS NEW LIFE!
Rebellion born of Slavery
  Now from its strongholds hurl’d—
The Starry Flag (at last!) shines forth
  Resplendent through the World.

3. This Godsent victory belongs
  Not to one clime alone:—
Like Heavenly dew, its blessings
  Descend on ev’ry zone
For HUMAN RIGHTS TRIUMPHANT,
  Old Afric’s ransom’d hordes
And Europe’s burthen’d millions
  Shall strike the joyful chords!

4. Long wave the Starry Banner!
  And let all Nations see,
By Slavery unclouded,
  The EMBLEM OF THE FREE!—
Its Stars ALL gleaming brightly—
  Its glories high unfurl’d—
The Sign of Hope and Triumph
  For Freedom through the World!
