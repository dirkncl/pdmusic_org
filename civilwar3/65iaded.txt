1.
I am dying, Egypt, dying,
Ebbs the crimson lifetide fast,
And the dark Plutonian shadows
Gather on the evening blast;
Let thine arms, Old queen, support me,
Hush thy sobs and bow thine ear,
Listen to the great heart-secrets
Thou, and thou alone must hear,
 Listen to the great heart-secrets,
 Thou, and thou alone must hear.

2.
Though my scorned and [--] legions,
Bear their [eagles?] high no more,
Tho' my wreck'd and [shelter'd?] galleys,
[Strew?] dark Astasia's [--] shore;
Tho' no glitt'ring quards surround me,
Proud to do their master's will,
I must perish like a Roman,
Die, the great [Triston-sir?] still,
 I must perish like a Roman,
 Die, the great [Triston-sir?] still,

3.
Let not Ceasar's servile minions
Mark the [La-? that's] laid low,
T'was no foeman's? hand that fell'd him,
'Twas his [-] that dealt the blow;
Dear, then [-- - -] lessons [?]
Ere a star shall loose its ray,
Him who drunk with thy caterers
Madly Hung a world away,
 Him who drunk with the caterers,
 Madly Hung a world away.

4.
Should the [home?] plebian rabble
Dare [pail?] my fame at Rome,
Where the noble spouse Octavia
Weeps within her widowed home,
Seek her, say the Gods have told me,
Altar's [augurs?] circling wings,
That her blood with mine commingled
Yet shall mount the throne of kings.
 That her blood with mine commingled
 Yet shall mount the throne of kings.

5.
And for thee, star-eyed Egyptian,
Glorious sorceress of the Nile,
Light the paths to Stygian horrors
With the splendors of they smile;
Give the Ceasar swans and [archers?]
Let his brow, the Laurel twine,
I can scorn the [pirate's?] triumph,
Triumphing in love like [Thine?]
 I can scorn the [pirate's?] triumph,
 Triumphing in love like [Thine?]

6.
I am dying, Egypt, dying,
Hark th' insulting foeman's cry,
They are coming! quick, my falchion!
Let me front them ere I die.
Ah! no more amid the battle
Shall my heart exulting swell,
Isis and Osiris guard thee,
Cleopatra! Rome! farewell!
 Isis and Osiris guard thee,
 Cleopatra! Rome! farewell!
