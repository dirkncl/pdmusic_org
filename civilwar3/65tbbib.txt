1. Hail, glorious chief! the country’s pride,
  For victory follows thee;
Thy fame is spreading far and wide,
  Great chieftain of the free!
The bravest army in the world
  Is being lef by you.
And freedom’s banner is unfurl’d
  By bonny boys in blue.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Brave General Sherman.
  O! Brave General Sherman O!
The boys in blue will fight with you.
  Brave General Sherman O!

2. On Shiloh’s bloody battle field
  He met old Beauregard,
Who found that Sherman would not yield,
   And took it very hard;
He’d water horse in Tennessee.
  That’s what he said he’d do,
But found brave Sherman in the way
  With bonny boys in blue.

3. And when the rebs on Vicksburg’s heights
  Were all corralled by Grant.
Joe Johnston thought he’d give us fits,
  But Sherman said, “You can’t.”
Joe Johnston found there were some things
  That he could never do;
He has to run whern Sherman brings
  His bonny boys in blue.

4. On Mission Ridge we met the foe,
  With Thomas and with Grant,
And on that glorious field, you know,
  Our banners they did plant,
Old Bragg and all his army fled—
  What else could Braxton do?—
When Grant and Sherman nobly led
  The bonny boys in blue.

5. Atlanta next was Sherman’s aim,
  Though Dalton blocked the way;
But flanking was the kind of game
  That Sherman knew would pay.
Joe Johnstaon found that to retreat
  Was all the way to do;
For it was dangerous to meet
  The bonny boys in blue.

6. From Dalton down to Kennesaw
  Joe Johnston did retreat;
From there he found he must withdraw
  Or meet a sore defeat.
And when within Atlanta’s walls,
  Says Hood, “I’ll show you, Joe,
That Sherman soon before me falls,,
  And all his boys in blue.”

7. Says Hood, I’ll try the flanking game;”
  But he didn’t make it pay:
For Thomas brought old Hood to shame,
  While Sherman went his way.
Down through Georgia Sherman went,
  Cut Rebeldom in two.
And in Savannah pitched his tent,
  With all his boys in blue.

8. For General Sherman, then we’ll shout,
  And Charleston next must fall;
The boys in blue will clean them out,
  Old Beauregard and all.
This base rebellion soon will end,
  The bottoms falling through;
Hurrah for General Sherman then,
  And bonny boys in blue.
