1. O, my eyes are red with weeping,
  For the bitter tears will flow;
And my anxious heart is beating
  With an anguish none can know.
Lonely, watching, fearing, hoping
  For the joy I ne’er shall see,
Still I foundly keep repeating:
  “When will he come back to me?”
    Still I foundly keep repeating:
    “When will he come back to me?”

2. On my lips, his kiss at parting
  Lingers yet like heav’nly dew,
As he said: “O, Minnie, darling!
  Will your heart be ever true?
Think upon thy soldier ever,
  Trust his heart is true to thee!”
Thus he left me, sad, dejected,—
  When will he come back to me?
    Thus he left me, sad, dejected,—
    When will he come back to me?

3. Tho’ the hours are swift in flying,
  Still my heart outstrips their flight;
For it says: “Perchance, tomorrow
  He may perish in the fight!”
Heav’n preserve my gallant soldier!
  Night and day my pray’r shall be
While I fondly keep repeating—
  When will he come back to me?
    While I fondly keep repeating—
    When will he com back to me?
