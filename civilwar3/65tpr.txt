1.
Now the bugle's thrilling blast,
  And the distant cannon's boom,
As they break upon the hopeful pris'ner's ear;
  And the marching of the men
As with measur'd tramp they come,
  Tell his sadden'd heart, relief is drawing near.

CHORUS
Joy now ev'ry heart is filling
  See our hopes were not in vain,
For the "Dear old Flag" has come
  And beneath its beauteous folds,
We shall see our homes and love'd ones once again.

2.
Now the conflict rages fierce
  And his heart is overcast
With a fearful thought that all may not be well
  But the clash of steel has ceased
And the smoke of battle past
  And he sees aloft the flag he loves so well.

(CHORUS)

3.
Now the heavy bolts are drawn
  Now the door is open thrown
And the glowing sunlight gilds the prison floor
  Many faces pale and wan
Many wasted forms are shown
  Weeping tears of joy to see their friends once more.

(CHORUS)
