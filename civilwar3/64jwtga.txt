1. My Bredren come and help me
To black my face and hands,
Before de Yankey bluejackets
Come here to make demands,
Before de Yankey blue Jackets
Come here to make demands.

[Refrain 1]
De Stars and Stripes are floating
O’er eb’ry State, dey say;
Come Breckenridge and black my nexk,
I want to get away,
Come Breckenridge and black my neck
I wsnt to get aesy.

2. Dis Fedracy is play’d out,
Dis money’s all a sham;
Bof Richmond and fort Sumpter
Must bow to Uncle Sam,
Bof Richmond and fort Sumpter
Must bow to Uncle Sam.

[Refrain 2]
De Stars and Stripes are floating
O’er eb’ry State, dey say;
And Father Abram’s bonny
Blues are sure to win de day,
And Father Abram’s bonny
Blues are sure to win de day.

3. Wid hearts and hands and faces black
Our mis’ry we deplore,
And hope de Blues won’t catch our track
Dis side Niagra’s shore,
And hope de Blues won’t catch our ttrack
Dis side Niagra’s shore.

[Refrain 3]
De Stars and Stripes are floating
O’er eb’ry State, dey say;
Come Breckenridge and black my nexk,
I want to get away,
Come Breckenridge and black my neck
I wsnt to get aesy.

4. De gunboats belch dat horrid sound,
Sam’s fund’ring cannons roar,
Muskets and bayonets resound:
Slav’ry shall be no more,
Muskets and bayonets resound:
Slav’ry shall be no more.

[Refrain 4]
De Stars and Stripes are floating
O’er eb’ry State, dey say;
And Father Abram’s bonny
Blues are sure to win de day,
And Father Abram’s bonny
Blues are sure to win de day.
