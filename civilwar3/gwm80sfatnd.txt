1. Strew flow’rs above the noble dead, 
Sweet with their tears of dew;
Let garlands ever bright be spread 
For these the good, the true!
Their deeds on Hist’ry’s page of fame, 
Forevermore shall last!
All honor’d be each glorious name 
Whose deeds illume the past.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Strew flow’rs above the noble dead, 
Sweet with the tears of dew;
Let garlands ever bright be spread 
For these the good, the true!

2. Strew flow’rs above the noble dead, 
And in each heart enshrin’d, 
Forevermore with hunger wed, 
Keep them in heart and mind;
No more the dreams shall beat for them,— 
Their labors new are done;
For them the glorious diadem, 
The noble vict’ty won.

3. Strew flow’rs above the noble dead, 
Alike the Blue, the Gray;
And in our hearts, all anger fled,— 
Be both enshrin’d today.
The brighten’d hues of earthly flow’rs 
Bespeak fond Nature’s praise;
So fresh be they in hearts of ours, 
Thro’ all the peaceful days.
