1. Homeward now the boys are marching!
Cruel war is at an end!
All along the way there’s cheering!
Shouts of joy and friendship blend!

[Refrain and CHORUS, each sung after each VERSE]
March! march! march! in peace amd gladness!
Friends now meet again once more!
March! march! march! but not in sadness!
For the cruel war is o’er!

2. Mothers no more will be weeping
For their darling children slain,
Fathers, sisters and fond brothers
Blissful, meet in joy again.

3. Peaceful all around the valleys,
Happy hearts now beat with glee!
Home the gallant boys are marching!
Bearing the banner of the Free.
