several words were questionably transcribed;
corrections would be appreciated]

1. Some white folks have been heard to say 
De niggers would not fight, 
But I guess dat dey look at it now quite in another light, 
Hush up your mouf you “Copperheads” dont take dat for a plea; 
To keep us from de battle field where all ob you should be. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Our cause is right and we will fight for dear old Uncle Sam, 
And show de traitors North and South though black we’re each a man.

2. At “Mekensie” Bend, Port Hudson too we made our massa’s suit, 
And I guess dey form’d de “clasion” dere dat we know how to shoot; 
I tink dat in a little while we’ll drive it in dere heads; 
De Uncle Sam will arm all “tings” dat can shoot down a “Reb.” 

3. Old massa “Kurnel” say to us which make us feel quite proud, 
Dat de Darkies made as good a mark as any in de crowd; 
And as we’re used to waiting on our massa’s heretofore. 
We’ll sever ’em up a little dish dat they’ve not bargain’d for. 

4. Dey talk about your arming slaves and make a “drafted” face, 
But shoot dey repedisite dere debts which am a great deal “wman.”Ï 
And when de nigger you compare wid traitors cist a tree. 
Dat dere deeds if not dere colar isz de whitest ob de two.
