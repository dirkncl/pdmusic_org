1. Long time ago there was a maid, 
Her name was Minnie Lee, 
And when I told her of my love, 
She said that she lov’d me; 
But since that time, ah! things have changed, 
Her heart’s grown cold to me; 
And many a merry year has pass’d 
Since I met Minnie Lee.

CHORUS 1
Minnie, Minnie, yes, sweet Minnie, 
I love Minnie Lee; 
Oh! I’ll forgive, forgive her all, 
If she will but love me.

2.  Minnie Lee, the girl I love, 
She looks so meek and mild, 
She told me that she once lov’d me, 
When I was but a child; 
She kiss’d me hand, she kissed my cheek, 
She sighed and drew from me; 
And since that time I have not seen 
My pretty Minnie Lee.

CHORUS 2
Then take me back to Tennessee, 
There let me live and die, 
Among her fields of yellow corn, 
Where Minnie’s sleeping now.
