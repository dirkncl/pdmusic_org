1. The fierce din of battle is now hush’d to rest,
Yet sad is the sorrow that preys on my breast,
For wild winds are sighing o’er wavelets that flow,
Where my lost love is lying, in Green Shenandoah.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The sweet joys I dream’d of, I never shall know,
For my heart’s in his grave in Green Shenandoah.

2. The glad smile of summer is crowning again
With rich balmy radiance the valley and plain,
Where he fell like a soldier, while charging the foe,
’Neath our own starry banner, in Green Shenandoah.

3. Oh! how proudly how fondly, I clung to his side,
With the strong hope at parting, of yet being his bride,
But the true heart that won me, is now lying low,
All lifeless and cold, in Green Shenandoah.

4. I’m weaving a garland to twine round his grave,
Where the sunlight is kissing the mounds of the brave,
Their sad tears shall lighten my heart’s bitter use,
As they fail o’er my darling, in Famed Shenandoah.
