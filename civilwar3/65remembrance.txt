1.
'Twas eve and May when last thro' tears,
Thine eyes sought mine, thy hand my hand,
The night came down her silent spheres
And up the silent land,
In silence too our thoughts were furl'd
Like ringdoves in the dreaming grove,
Who would not lightly lose the world,
To keep such love, to keep such love;
Who would not lightly the world,
To keep, to keep such love.

2.
But many Mays will all their flow'rs,
Are faded since that blissful time,
The last of all my happy hours,
In the golden clime,
By hands not thine these wreaths were curl'd,
That hide the care my brows above,
And I have almost gain'd the world,
But lost thy love, have lost thy love,
And I have almost gain'd the world.
But lost, have lost they love.

3.
As tho' for some serence dear brow,
These wreaths for me, I let them twine,
I hear the voice of praise and know,
And know it is not thine.
How many long and lonely days,
I strove with life thy love to gain.
I know my work was worth thy praise,
But all was vain, but all was vain,
I know my work was worth thy praise,
'Twas all, 'twas all in vain.
