1. Where Potomac’s pearly waters
  Softly kiss tje dew of morn,
And the golden sunbeams shineth,
  Fairest landscapes to adorn,
Lay a young and gallant warrior,
  Far away from friends and love;
But around his form was gathered
  Happy angels from above.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Gently, softly Willie murmured,
  Oh! that mother dear would come!
But stern death is fast approaching,
  “Comrades I am going home.”

2. Then he closed his eyes in slumber
  Oh! how soft and sweet the sleep;
As we gathered ’round his pillow,
  Breaking hearts in sorrow weep;
But a smile o’erspread his features—
  Smile of heavenly light and love,
And we knew that noble Willie
  Soon would bloom in courts above.

3. Then as death’s approach drew nearer,
  He awoke from slumber sweet,
Called us all his loving brothers—
  Hoping then we in heaven might meet;
He had nobly done his duty—
  He had waved our flag on high
In the fiercest of the battle
  And was now content to die.

4. Soon he saw our starry banner,
  Floating high in ether blue,
And his bosom swelled with rapture—
  He had to that flag proved true;
While the ’ebon angels lingered,
  Soon to touch the magic wand,
Willie’s feeble shouts were ringing
  For the emblem of our land.

5. ’Neath a mould on sunny hillside,
  They have laid his form to rest,
With his white arms gently folded
  O’er his still and lifeless breast;
These his words of love and friendship:
  “Tell my mother dear to come!
I will meet you all in heaven—
  Comrads I am going home.”
