1. I wonder why he comes not.
I hear the rolling drum.
Of the boys in blue returning home.
But still he does not come.
I see the tatter’d standards.
They proudly bear on high.
And mark the gleam of home delights
That gladness every eye.

CHORUS 1­-3.
I wonder why he comes not.
I hear the rolling drum.
Of the boys in blue returning home
But still he does not come.

2. I wonder why he comes not.
I hear the happy shout.
From rank to rank along the line.
As loving forms peep out.
From ev’ry open window
A kiss or smile is thrown.
But still but still he comes not home.
The one I call my own.

3. I wonder why he comes not.
Alas! my throbbing heart.
But echoes back the fears it gave.
When we were forced to part.
I dare not ask his comrades.
Who battled by his side.
Why they are here and he is not.
My loved one and my pride.

4. I wonder why he comes not.
I know it full too well.
That where the battle fiercest raged.
Twas there my brave one fell.
And through the burning tear drops.
My eye will vainly roam.
To find his form the ranks among
He’ll never, never come.

CHORUS 4.
I wonder why he comes not.
How mocks the rolling drum.
I search in vain the ranks among.
He’ll never, never come.
