1. Where the dews and the rains of heaven have their fountain.
Like its thunder and its lightning our braves burst on the foe
Up above the clouds on Freedom’s Lookout Mountain
Raining lifeblood like water on the valleys down below.
O, green be the laurels that grow,
O sweet be the wildbuds that blow
In the dells of the mountain where the brave are lying low,
In the dells of the mountain where the brave are lying low.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O green be the laurels that grow.
O sweet be the wildbuds that blow in the dells of the mountain
where the brave are lying low,
In the dells of the mountain where the brave are lying low.

2. Light of our hope, and crown of our story,
Bright as sunlight, pure as starlight shall their deeds of daring glow.
When the day and the night out of heaven shed their glory
On Freedom’s Lookout Mountain whence they routed Freedom’s foe.
O soft be the gales when they go
Through the pines on the summit where they blow,
Chaunting solemn music for the souls that passed below,
Chaunting solemn music for the souls that passed below.
