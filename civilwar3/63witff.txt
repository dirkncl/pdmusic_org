1.
Where is the Freeman found,
When tyrants his home invade?
Where is teh holiest ground,
When despots our hearths degrade?
Here at the cannon's mouth?
On the red field,
Where the bayonet gleams,
And our your banner streams
Over men who have sworn not to yield!

CHORUS
Come Brothers, Brothers come,
Come to the cannon's mouth!
There is your only home,
Men of the sunny South.

2.
Quick be the last kiss giv'n,
Stay not for bridal vow --
Sweet Peace has fled to Heav'n,
War is our watchword now;
Then to the battlefield
All who are men,
And with steel flashing forth,
Give our friends of the North,
The greeting of Bethel again!

(CHORUS)
