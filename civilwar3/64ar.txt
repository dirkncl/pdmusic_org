1. She came to our home in the Springtime,
When the sweet prairie flowers were in bloom;
When the hill side was covered with roses,
And the soft sighing zephyrs bro’t perfume.
When the bright little blue birds were singing,
Their sweet plaintive songs all the day,
When the swan o’er the blue wave was dancing,
She came to our home sweet Ally Ray.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Ally, Angel Ally, Sweet Ally Ray;
Thou are gone to the land that is starward,
Thou hast flown like the summer birds away.

2. Thy coming was like gentle evening,
When twilight is weeping o’er the lea,
Like dews from the blue dome of heaven,
When soft gentle zephrys kiss the sea.
We call’d thee our fairy, our birdling,
We watch’d o’er thy form day by day;
But the flower that we lov’d, it has faded—
Thou art gone from our home sweet Ally Ray.

3. ’Twas down by the streamlet we laid thee,
When the sun was sinking in the west,
Where the wild roses bloom in the springtime,
We laid thee our darling down to rest.
But they spirit has gone to its Giver,
Away from the cold earthly clay;
To the bright sunny land o’er the river,
Where Angels will welcome Ally Ray.
