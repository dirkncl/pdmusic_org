1.
Welcome! welcome! gallant soldiers,
Heroes of a noble band;
Bravely have you done your duty,
Battling for your own dear land.
Shout the welcome, sing the peans
For our soldiers, true and brave;
Let the notes of praise be sounded
Let the starry banner wave.

CHORUS
Welcome! Welcome! gallant soldiers
Heroes of a noble band;
Bravely have you done your duty,
Battling for your own dear land.

2.
But we sadly mourn the lost ones,
Those who fell upon the field;
Those who gave their lives for freedom,
And foeman ne'er did yield.
But though dead, their memory liveth,
And will brighter grow with time;
And their names be known in story,
And their deeds be sung in rhyme.

(CHORUS)

3.
Hail! all hail! ye war-scarred vet'rans,
Who are left to mourn the dead,
Who unharmed have run the gauntlet
Where the deadly missiles sped,
Who have borne the brunt of battle
'Neath the banner of the stars,
Who have battled for the Union,
And who wear the hero's scars.

CHORUS
We extend a thousand welcomes;
In the field your work is done;
Lay aside your arm of war fare,
Welcome, gallant soldiers, home.
