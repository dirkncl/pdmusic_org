1. God bless our noble army!
The hearts are strong and brave
That have willing come our standard
From treason’s grasp to save;
But from the Western Prairie
To Atlantic’s rocky shore,
The truest noblest hearts of all
Are in the “Old Sixth Corps.”

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Then, ere we part tonight, boys,
We’ll sing one song the more,
With chorus swelling loud and clear,
God bless the “Old Sixth Corps!

2. In the thickest of the batle,
Where the cannon’s fiery breath
Smites many a strong heart pressing
On to victory or death!
The foremost in the conflict,
The last to say, “’tis o’er”
Who know not what it is to yield
You’ll find the “Old Sixth Corps.”

3. There’s many a brave man lying
Where he noble fought and fell;
There’s many a mother sighing
For the sons she loved so well;
And the Southern winds are breathing
A requiem where they lie—
O, the gallant followers of the cross
Are not afraid to die!

4. Our truest, bravest heart is gone,
And we remember well
The bitter anguish of that day
When noble _Sedgwick_ fell;
But there is still another left
To lead us to the fight,
And with a hearty three times thee
We’ll cheer our gallant _Wright_.

5. Then on! still onward will we press,
Till treason’s voice is still,
And proudly waves the “Stripes and Stars”
On ev’ry Southern hill.
We’ll struggle till our flag is safe
And honer’d as before;
And men in future times shall say,
God bless the “Old Sixth Corps!”
