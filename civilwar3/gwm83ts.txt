1. We bought him a box for his books and toys, 
And a cricket bag for his bat;
And he looked the brightest, and best of boys 
Under his new straw hat.
We handed him into the railway train 
With a troop of his young compeers, 
And we made as though it were dust, and rain 
Were filling our eyes with tears.

2. We looked in his innocent face to see 
The sign of a sorrowful heart;
But he only shouldererd his bat with  glee, 
And won dered when they would start.
’Twas not that he loved not, as heretofore, 
For the boy was ten der and kind;
But his was a world that was all before, 
And ours was a world behind.

3. ’Twas not that his fluttering heart was cold, 
For the child was loyal and true;
But the parent6s love’s  the love that is old, 
And the children’s the love that is new, 
And we came to know, that love is a flow’r 
Which only groweth down;
And we scarely spoke for the space of an hour, 
As we drove back through the town.
