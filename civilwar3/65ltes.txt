1. Our days of bondage now are past,
  Let the eagle scream!
The skies are no more overcast;
    Let the eagle scream!
We’ll  loose the bird and let him sing,
Let Freedom’s chorus loudly ring,
No matter what the future bring,
  Let the eagle scream!

CHORUS 1-5
[with overlapping voices]
[Soprano/Alto]
Let the eagle “Let him scream!”
Let the eagle “Let him scream!”
[Tenor/Bass]
Oh “Let him scream!”
Yes, “Let him scream!”

[SATB]
Why dom’t you let the eagle scream?
“Let the eagle scream!”
Why dom’t you let the eagle scream?
“Let the eagle scream!”

2 There is no South, East, West or North,
  Let the eagle screan!
Be peace and plenty ours henceforth,
  Let the eagle scream!
The States are one unbroken band,
Let politicians umderstand
That they can’t rule our happy land,
  Let the eagle scream!

3. There’s trouhle down in Mexico,
  Let the eagle scream!
And Maximilian soon must go,
  Let the eagle scream!
Napopeon has there no right,
And if he does not quit our sight,
Why, Uncle Sam will have to fight,
  Let the eagle scream!

4. Old England soon will have a row,
  Let the eagle scream!
Of course, we’ll all be neutral now
  Let the eagle scream!
We shan’t fit out the privateers
To take her commerce by the ears
Nor furnish any volunteers,
  Let the eagle scream!

5. “Be sure you’re right, then go ahead,”
  Let the eagle scream!
I think that’s what Dave Crockett said
  Let the eagle scream!
The old bird knows a  thing or two
About the old red, white and blue,
And says that he will put it through
  Let the eagle scream!
