1.
I have seen again the grave of Hally, sweet Hally, sweet Hally,
I have seen again the grave of Hally,
And the flow'rs above her now are in the bloom;
And the mocking bird is in the valley, the valley, the valley,
And the mocking bird is in the valley,
And the willow trees are waving o'er her tomb.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Yes, the mocking bird is sweetly singing,
And the flow'rs above her now are in their bloom;
Yes, the mocking bird is sweetly singing,
And the willow trees are waving o'er her tomb.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Yes, the mocking bird is sweetly singing,
And the flow'rs above her now are in their bloom;
Yes, the mocking bird is sweetly singing,
And the willow trees are waving o'er her tomb.

2.
I shall ne'er forget, 'twas in September, September, September,
I shall ne'er forget, 'twas in September,
When my Hally dear was taken from my side;
And the harvest time I well remember, remember, remember,
And the harvest time I well remember,
When they gather'd in the cotton far and wide.

3.
Now I feel again, like one forsaken, forsaken, forsaken,
Now I feel again, like one forsaken,
And the loss of Hally fills my heart with pain;
And within my heart sad thoughts awaken, awaken, awaken,
And within my heart sad thoughts awaken,
When I think I ne'er shall see her face again.
