1. No part nor lot in the glorious work; 
No part nor lot had I: 
But I sat like a frog on an old hollow log, 
And croaked to the passers by.

[TRIO] CHORUS 1
Croak— Croak— Croak— 
There were many paused to hear,
And many more slackened their pace,
And soon turned back in fear.

2. No part nor lot in the glorious work; 
No part nor lot had I: 
But I aimed my gun to the newrisen sun, 
And fired at his Godlike eye.

[TRIO] CHORUS 2
Fire— fire— fire—
We thought we were many and strong,
And could humbug the nation with volleys of words
To thinking right was wrong.

3. No part not lot in the glorious work; 
No part nor lot had I: 
But I trod the long grass where the patriots would pass, 
And sneered at their rallying cry.

[TRIO] CHORUS 3
Sneer— sneer— sneer— 
’Tis a word with a double edge,
And before it many a runner has turned
To the homestead side of his hedge.

4. No part nor lot in the glorious work;
No part nor lot had I:
’Twas little I cared how the bondmen fared,
Though his chains clanked under my eye.

[TRIO] CHORUS 4
Clank— clank— clank—
No matter how heavy the pain,
No matter how cutting the steely lash
That fell o’er the negro’s brain.

5. No part nor lot in the glorious work;
No part nor lot had I:
And when the air swells with the music of bells
I only look down with a sigh.

[TRIO] CHORUS 5
Bells— bells— bells— 
They tell us the nation is free,
And the noble achievers, coworkers with God—
But Copperheads, what are we?
