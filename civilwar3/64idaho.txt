1. They say, there is a land, 
Where crystal waters flow, 
O’er beds of quarts and purest gold, 
Way out in Idaho.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O! wait, Idaho! 
We’re coming, Idaho, 
Our four “hos” team will soon be seen, 
Way out in Idaho.

2. We’re bound to cross the plains 
And up the mountains go, 
We’re bound to seek our fortune there, 
Way out in Idaho.

3. We’ll need no pick nor spade, 
No shov el, pan, or hoe, 
The largest chunks are ’top of ground, 
Way out in Idaho.

4. We’ll see hard times no more, 
And want we’ll never know, 
When once we’ve filled our sacks with gold, 
Way out in Idaho.
