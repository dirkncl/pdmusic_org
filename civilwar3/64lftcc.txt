1. I seed three p’licemen in the strand, 
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho, 
I seed three p’licemen in the strand 
And I know’d as they’d got a chase on hand.
	Luddy, fuddy. oh poor Luddy heigho.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho.

2. And I seed as they axed each passerby, 
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho, 
And I seed as they axed each passerby 
And I knew as the cove what they wanted was I.
	Luddy, fuddy. oh poor Luddy heigho.

3. First they axed a Frenchman they chanc’d to meet,
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho.
First they axed a Frenchman they chanc’d to meet,
“Il est la! Vous le trouverex toute de suite.”
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho.

4. Then they axed a Dutchman “Ya mynheer”
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho,
“I see yist sesh man bass by here
Vile I sits at mein toor and trinks mein peer,”
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho.

5. Now why did this throw them off the track,
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho,
Now why did this throw them off the track
Cos Frenchman and Dutchman was both coll the Crack,
	Luddy, fuddy, oh poor Luddy heigho.
