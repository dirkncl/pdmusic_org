1. Look! from each hill and valley,
See the friends of freedom rally!
Traitor bands can never tally
  With so brave a foe!
Hark! dont you hear that humming?
And the sound of distant drumming?
’Tis the host of freedom coming,
  To the front they go!
  To the front they go!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
March to the field of glory,
Volunteers and veterans hoary.
Bring back the joyful story
  That our land is free!
  Our land is free!
Union’s sacred cause befriending,
Freedom’s shining flag defending,
Shout to shout in chorus blending,
  On to victory!
  On to victory!
  On to victory!

2. On land and on the ocean,
Armies cast are now in motion,
Fighting with the true devotion,
  Of a patriot band!
Hark! now the cannon’s thunder,
Rending earth and air asunder,
Bids rebellion stand from under
  Fate’s uplifted hand!
  Fate’s uplifted hand!

3. See! see our glorious banner
Floating over proud Savannah,
Let us shout a loud hosanna
  To the hero’s fame!
The “Anaconda’s” folds grow tighter,
And the cause of freedom brighter,
While each patriot’s heart beats lighter
  As you speak his name,
  As you speak his name.

4. Victory we shall win it,
For the hand of God is in it,
Every hour and every minute,
  Help to seal the doom
Of the shattered ranks of treason,
They rebelled without good reason,
And defied us for a season.
  But their end is come!
  But their end is come!
