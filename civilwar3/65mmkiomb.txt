1. My mother’s kiss is on my brow,
Her hand has touched my cheek
I feel a heav’nly rapture now
That earth’s lips cannot speak.
I know my mother went to rest
In realms of light on high,
Yet she has come, at love’s request—
To bless me ere I die.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
My mother’s kiss in on my brow,
Her hand has touched my cheek,
I feel a heav’nly rapture now
That earth’s lips cannot speak.

2. I hear her voice as in a dream
Of happiness and joy,
And scenes from childhood’s treasures seem
To cheer her dying boy;
She brings, to soothe life’s closing hour,
Her spirit pure and sweet,
And love exerts its magic power,
To make my bliss complete.

3. Oh! tell me not that I but dream,
That mother is not here,
For now I see her sweet smile beam,
I hear her voice so clear;
She bids me come to fairer spheres,
Where happy angels dwell,
A gain she’s smiling thro’ her tears,
My comrades dear, farewell!
