1. 
It’s hard to have you leave us, John,
They all are gone but you;
We’er getting old and feeble, now
Our journey’ll soon be through.
But since it is God’s pleasure John,
To guide you on your way,
Accept, my boy, this precious book,
And don’t forget to pray,
Accept, my boy, this precious book,
And don’t forget to pray.

CHORUS
Goodby God bless you John
Shall be our daily pray’r,
And if we we we we meet no more below,
Oh don’t forget to pray. 
God bless and keep you John 
Good by God bless you John 
Shall be our daily pray’r, our pray’r.

2. 
This book has been a treasure, John,
To father and to me;
As it has been to millions, and
To millions more will be.
In sickness, pain and sorrow, John,
’Twill shed a cheering ray­­
Then let it be your constant guide,
And don’t forget to pray,
Then let it be your constant guide,
And don’t forget to pray.

3. 
This world is full of wickedness,
Of luring snares and sin;
And thousands, madly pressing on,
Are daily falling in;
But if you would escape them, John,
And keep the narrow way,
Oh! make God’s Word your counsellor,
And don’t forget to pray.
Oh! make God’s Word your counsellor,
And don’t forget to pray.

4. 
With yearning hearts we’ll pray, dear John,
For your eternal weal,
Around the fam’ly altar each
At morn and evening kneel;
In spirit you may join us John,
Though many miles away,
If in your heart this Word you hide;
And don’t forget to pray.
If in your heart this Word you hide;
And don’t forget to pray.

5. 
Goodby! God bless and keep you, John,
Shall be our daily pray’r;
And if we meet no more below,
God grant we may up there.
And we have this assurance, John,
To cheer us, that we may,
If we the Bible make our guide,
And don’t forget to pray.
If we the Bible make our guide,
And don’t forget to pray.
