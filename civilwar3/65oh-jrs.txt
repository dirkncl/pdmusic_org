1. Three cheers for our heroes,
  Not those who wear the stars,
Nor those who wear the eagles,
  The leaflets and the bars,
We know they are gallant,
  And honor them too,
For bravely defending
  The Red, White, and Blue.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Three cheers for our heroes,
  The gallant and the brave,
May emblems of freedom
  O’er them ever wave,
We know they are gallant,
  We know they are ture,
They are bravely defending
  The Red, White, and Blue.

2. But cheers for our soldiers,
  Rough, wrinkled, and brown,
The men who make our heroes,
  And ask no renown.
Unselfish, untiring,
  Intrepid and true,
The bulwark surrounding
  The Red, White, and Blue.

3. Our patriot soldiers,
  When treason arose,
And freedom’s own, own children,
  Assailed here as foes,
When anarchy threatened,
  And order withdrew
They rallied to rescue,
  The Red, White, and Blue.

4. Upholding our banner
  On many a field,
The doom of the traitor,
  They valiantly sealed,
And worn with the conflict,
  Found vigor anew,
Where victory greeted
  The Red, White, and Blue.

5. Yet loved ones have fallen,
  And still where they sleep,
A sorrowing nation,
  Shall silently weep
And spring’s fairest flowers,
  In gratitude strew,
Over those who have cherished,
  The Red, White, and Blue.
