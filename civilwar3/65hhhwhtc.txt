1. We were thinking of home, yes! of dear ones at home,
When faint cam the tap of the drum,—
And we listened again, for we hoped to be free,
We hopes that our brave boys had come;
There were tears in our eyes, as the drum beat once more,
Our hearts seemed to thrill with sweetest joy.
For the flag was insight that would banish our pain,
Restore to the mother her boy!

[CHORUS unaccompanied after each VERSE]
Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming~
Loved one, we’ll soon be home with thee!
Oh! ring the bells! boom the guns! shout hurrah!
’Tis over, and all now are free!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hark! Hark! Hark! We hear them coming!
Loved one we’ll soon be home with thee!
Oh! ring the bells! boom the guns! shout hurrah!
’Tis over, and all now are free!

2. We had dreamed of the time when the war should be o’er,
We felt that sweet peace hovered near,—
And we shouted as mortals ne’er shouted before,
And gave the brave boys cheer on cheer!
We’ll remember the boys who have opened the doors
And said to the prisoner “go free!”
That he might see the Union triumphant again
And Freedom from the sea to the sea!
