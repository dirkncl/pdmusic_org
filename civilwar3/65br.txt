1.
Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angel feet have trod
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God!

CHORUS
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river
gather with the saints at the river,
That flows by the throne of God.

2.
On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever,
All the happy golden day.

(CHORUS)

3.
On the bosom of the river,
Where our Saviour-king we own,
We shall meet, and sorrow never
'Neath the glory of the throne.

(CHORUS)

4.
Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down,
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown.

(CHORUS)

5.
At the smiling of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever,
Lift their songs of saving grace.

(CHORUS)

6.
Soon we'll reach the silver river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.

(CHORUS)
