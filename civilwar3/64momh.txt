1. Oh! darkies haint you seen it, 
  The glorious day hab come,
When wes a gwine to hab de land,
  And make Ole Massa hum,
Ole Abe hab done and said it,
  He say de ting what’s right,
He surely spoken de big word,
  What means dat we shall fight.

CHORUS 1-3.
We’ll make Ole Massa hum!
We’ll make Ole Massa hum!
Ole Abe had giben us de land,
And Massa dasant come.
We’ll make Ole Massa him!
We’ll make Ole Massa hum!
Ole Abe hab giben us de land,
And Massa dasant come.

2. The darkies am a comin,
  To take Ole Massa down,
We’ll rise up dar and help em den
  To do de traitors brown;
He’s giben us de musticks,
  And dat’s what makes us sing,
And when shoots de bullet out
  Dat will Ole Massa bring.

3. Ole Abe he was delected,
  And dat’s what made us free,
We’ll nebber work for Massa more
  Way down in Tennessee;
Now when dis war am ober,
  And we gets home again,
And Massa am knocked under den,
  He’ll sartin lose his pain.
