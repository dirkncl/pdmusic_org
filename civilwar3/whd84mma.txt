1. 
Beneath an old and stately pine,
Their trysting place for years,
They met to spend one happy hour,
And then to part in tears.
Cheer up he said my darling one,
And here at close of day,
On thoughts bright wings I’ll come to thee,
Though many, many miles away.

CHORUS
Many, many miles away,
Many, many miles away,
Softly to her heart came the words so dear,
Though many, many miles away, 
yes, many, miles away, yes, many, miles away,

2. 
The summer roses bloom’d and died,
The autumn winds went by,
And winter’s cold and chilly blast,
Now swept along the sky;
The maiden still her promise kept,
At close of ev’ry day,
To meet in thought the youth she lov’d,
Though many, many miles away.

3. 
And when the gentle spring return’d,
And just a year had pass’d,
Her patient trusting constant love,
Was crown’d with joy at last.
Beneath the old and stately pine,
She heard a sweet voice say
“To you, alone, my thoughts have flown,
Though many, many miles away.”
