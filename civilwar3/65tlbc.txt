1.
There's a church in the valley by the wildwood,
No lovlier place in the dale,
No spot is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the vale.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
(Oh! come, come, come, come,)
Come to the Church by the wildwood,
Oh, come to the church in the dale,
No spot is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the vale.

2.
How sweet on a bright Sabbath morning,
To list to the clear ringing bell.
Its tones so sweetly are calling,
Oh come to the church in the vale.

3.
THere close by the church in the valley,
Lies one that I loved so well.
She sleeps, sweetly 'neath the willow,
Disturb not her rest in the vale.

4.
There, there by the side of that loved one,
'Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom,
Where the farewell hymn shall be chanted,
I shall rest by her side in the tomb.
