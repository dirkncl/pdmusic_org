1. Oh yes I am a Southern girl,
  And glory in the name,
And boast it with far greater pride,
  Than glitt’ring wealth or fame;
I envy not the Northern girl
  Her robes of beauty rare,
Tho’ diamonds grace her snowy neck,
  And pearls bedeck her hair.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! Hurrah! for the Sunny South so dear,
Three cheers for the homespun dress that Southern ladies wear!

2. My homespun dress is plain, I know,
  My hat’s palmetto too,
But then it shows what Southern girls
  For Southern rights will do;
We’ve sent the bravest of our land
  To battle with the foe,
And we will lend a helping hand,
  We love the South, you know.

3. The Southern land’s a glorious land,
  And has a glorious cause,
Three cheers, three cheers for Southern Rights,
  And for the Southern Boys!
We’ve sent our sweethearts to the war,
  But dear girls, never mind,
Your soldierboy will ne’er forget,
  The girl he left behind.

4. The soldier is the lad for me,
  A brave heart I adore;
And when the Sunny South is free,
  And fighting is no more,
I’ll choose me then a lover brave
  From out that gallant band;
The soldier lad I love the best
  Shall have my heart and hand.

5. And now, young man, a word to you,
  If you would win the fair,
Go to the field where honor calls,
  And win your lady there.
Remember that our brightest smiles
  Are for the true and brave,
And that our tears are all for those
  Who fill a soldier’s grave.
