1. Joy! Joy! the War is over.
Peace now resumes her reign:
Nature makes haste to cover.
Ev’ry trace of buried slain.
We will not forget you brothers:
In your lowly beds who lie.
But record in song for others.
How ye did not fear to die.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Joy! Joy! the War is over!
All the sounds of battle cease;
(Now sing we)
Sing we in hearty Chorus;
Hail! all hail the reign of Peace.

2. Joy! Joy! the War is over.
Dear ones return again:
Husband, and son, and lover.
Homeward from the battle plain.
And tho for the unreturning,
Some their lonely vigils keep.
Give the day to fruitless mourning
Sadly wake at night to weep.

3. Joy! Joy! the War is over.
Joy! Joy the contest’s done.
Foemen embrace as brothers.
North and South henceforth are one.
Praise to Him who rules the nations.
He doth first our thanks demand.
Then we’ll crown with glad ovations
All the heroes of our land.
