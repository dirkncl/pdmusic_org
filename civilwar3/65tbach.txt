1. I wandered by the brookside
While yet ’twas early morn,
And the silver dewdrops sparkled
Like gems upon the lawn;
The sun his light was casting
In a broad and golden sheet
Upon the little streamlet
That rippled at my feet,
And while I gazed enraptured
Beneath the azure dome,
The wavelets seem’d to murmur,
The boys are coming home.

2. I turned, and in the sunlight,
Half nestled in the grass,
Kissed by the morning zephyrs
That softly rustled past,
The flowers, Spring’s choicest treasure,
They almost human seemed,
As all their quaint, enamelled eyes
Among the dewdrops gleamed,
And in their tinny faces
Read I, as in printed tome
The burden of the stremlet’s song,
The boys are coming home.

3. I looked far down into my heart,
So free from pain and care,
Mirrored in its depths I saw
A brother’s image there.
And looking on the dear­loved  face,
I banished all my fears;
And “Harry’s coming, too,” I  said,
Amid my joyful tears.
Then hail the time thro’ all our land
God grant it soon may come
When peace with folded wings shall smile
To see the boys come home.
