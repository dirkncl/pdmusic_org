1. When the battle is o’er and the sounds of fight,
  Have closed with the closing day,
How happy around the watch fire’s light,
  To chat the long hours away.
To chat the long hours away my boy
  And talk of the days to come,
Or a better still, and a purer joy,
  To think of our far off home.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We’ll chat the long hours away, my boy,
And talk of the days to come
Or a better still, and a purer joy,
To think of our far off home.

2. How many a cheek will then grow pale,
  That never felt a tear,
And many a stalwart heart will quail,
  That never quailed in fear.
And a breast that like some mighty rock,
  Amid the foaming sea,
Bore high against the battle shock,
  Now heaves like infancy.

3. And those who know each other not,
  Their hands together steal
Each thinks of some long hallowed spot,
  And all like brothers feel.
Such holy thoughts to all are given,
  The lowliest has his parts.
The love of home, like love of heaven,
  Is woven in our hearts.
