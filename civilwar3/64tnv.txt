1.
We arm by thousands strong,
To battle for the right,
And this shall be our song,
As we march into the fight;
With our country's banner o'er us,
And the traitor ranks before us,
Let Freedom be the chorus,
Of the Northern Volunteers,
Let Freedom be the chorus,
Of the Northern Volunteers.

2.
When Northern men unite,
Heart to heart and hand to hand,
For Freedom's cause to fight;
Shall wrong the right withstand!
With our country's banner o'er us
And rebels base before us,
And Liberty the chorus,
Of the Northern Volunteers
And Liberty the chorus,
Of the Northern Volunteers.

3.
God of Freedom! give Thy might,
To the spirits of Thy sons,
To their bayonets in fight,
To the death within their guns,
Make their deeds in battle holy,
Burn and brightly shine the glory
Then the world shall read the story,
Of the Northern Volunteers,
Then the world shall read the story,
Of the Northern Volunteers.
