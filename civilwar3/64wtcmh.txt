1. When this cruel war is over, 
And they all come marching home, 
We’ll have a shout of gladness 
From ev’ry heart and dome. 
[May be sung by Chorus.]
Oh! then we’ll have a jubilee. 
And shout from shore to shore, 
God bless the brave defenders, 
When this cruel war is o’er.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
When war shall cease, 
And they all come marching home, 
When war shall cease, 
And they all come marching home.

2. Their country was in danger,
And they strarted at the call,
And said the starry banner
Should yet wave over all.
[May be sung by Chorus.]
And in many a hard fought battle,
They stood their ground alone,
God bless the brave defenders,
As they come marching home!

3. Like heroes have they battled,
Like vet’rans have been true,
And though their ranks are thinner now,
And number but a few,
[May be sung by Chorus.]
Yet we’ll give them all a welcome,
As they come marching home,
And drop a tear for the loved one
That sleepeth there alone.

4. Their names will stand on record,
Like Washington of old,
And like his brave defenders,
Shine out in lines of gold.
[May be sung by Chorus.]
They left the starry banner,
Still waving o’er the dome,
That Washington erected
As he came marching home.
