1. No doubt you all have seen the CURE,
  Who always sprang so high,
But he’s gone up, so I’ve been told,
  He’s jumped into the sky.
Another sensation’s just come out,
  Who’s all upon the swerve;
So boys look out, I’m known you see
  As the chap whats got the nerve.
Oh! I’m a saucy boy you see,
  And I wish you to observe,
There’s lots of girls would marry me,
  But they hav’n’t go the nerve.

2. There’s many folks would like to get
  Their money back again,
I mean the crowd who now are struck
  With OIL upon the BRAIN,
And many too would like to buy,
  At least so I have heard,
But unless they get a flowing well
  They hav’n’t got the nerve.
Oh I’m a curious sort of being,
  But your patience pray preserve,
As the smell of ILE gives me the BILE
  And alters all my nerves.

3. Now havn’t we got fighting men
  To whom all fear’s a stranger,
When led by men like Sheridan
  They never can see danger.
And Mister Grant is up to snuff,
  But Sherman does deserve
The nation’s thanks for well he’s proved,
  That he has got the nerve
Both France and England now look on
  And speak with great reserve,
For Yankey Doodle is the Boy
  That will keep up his nerves.

4. I like to speak my mind right out,
  And therefore I will mention
This cruel war ’twixt North and South
  Should claim our attention.
I’ll bet the Pennsylvania Boys
  The Union will preserve,
And when they meet the rebel foes
  Oh ain’t they got a nerve?
Good gracious me Atlanta’s gone,
  Savanah too, observe,
And Lee would capture Washington,
  But he hasn’t got the nerve.
