1. This world’s a very funny world, 
And everybody tries 
To ride some hobby if they can, 
Regardless of his sins; 
So some are in for politics, 
For fashion, honor, gain; 
But one and all have some time had 
Love on the brain.

CHORUS [sung after verses 1-­6]
Kisses, blisses, hearts, darts, 
Arematle pain; 
Everybody’s troubled once 
With love on the brain.

2. No wonder that he gambles now, 
That bachelor forlorn. 
He’s thinking of an early vow, 
Made one bright summer’s morn; 
And how she put his feelings up, 
And sold his love for gain, 
And left the fellow pining with 
Love on the brain.

3. Each haughty monarch on his throne
Has felt love’s mighty power;
And many a titled land, for love
Has forfeted his dower.
Over soldiers on the battlefield,
And sailors on the main,
May bravely fight, but yield their arms
To love on the brain.

4. Our modern days bring out gay bells,
Before they’re in their teens;
And often Young American
Would we, but ? the ?;
And while our Romeo despairs,
Our Juliet would ?
Hopes, sing and sigh, and laugh and cry,
Love on the brain.

5. Now, when you see a maiden glance
Quite marvlously around,
Then blush, and cast her eyelids down,
As if to ? the ground;
Or when a young man taken to rhyming,
To ease his heart in vain;
You may be sure they both have got
Love on the brain.

6. And now I have a word to say
To friends, and parents too;
Don’t grumble if the boys and girls
Should follow after you;
For well you know, though now you’re old,
You really can’t complain,
For you have had, or should have had,
Love on the brain.

[ADDENDA]
7. And now, young ladies, let me give
A parting word to you—
Make all your lovers sign the pledge,
And to the cause be true;
For if they’re not true temperance men,
One fact is very plain,
They’ll very soon have some thing else
Than love on the brain.

[ADDENDA--CHORUS]
7. Kisses, blisses, hearts, darts,
Aremantle pain;
They’'ll very soon have something else
Than love on the brain.
