1. Our boys are all gone to the war—
This cruel and terrible war;
They have left us to mourn
For many dear ones
That are buried away so far.
At evening, alone we sit
’Round the fireside; praises we sing
Of the vict’rys that crown
Their battle field,
When to the dear flag they cling.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Our boys are all gone to the war—
This cruel and terrible war;
They have left us to mourn
For many dear ones
That are buried away so far.

2. To their country’s call quickly they flew,
With strong arms, and hearts ever true;
They will conquer the foe,
As onward they go;
And, if need be, we will go too.
They’ve left us in tears, alone—
In our homes that were merry with glee—
To rescue our land
From the traitor band,
That once was so hapoy and free.

3. When our boyas all come marching for home—
Their bright and their dear happy home—
Many warm hearts will great,
The brave boys they meet,
As in glory, returning, they come.
Their banners they’ll fling to the breeze,
And so proudly it ever shall wave;
All nations shall see
Our land was made free
By the boys that were true and brave.
