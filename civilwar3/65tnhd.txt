1. Hearts, like dirges low, are wailing,
For the Nation’s honored DEAD—
Banners draped and pensions trailing,
Tell how recent you had fled.
While the heavens, aglow with wonder,
Gleamed with beaconlight on high,
Tidings fell, like pealing thunder,
Echoing from  a cloudless sky.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hearts, like dirges low, are wailing,
For the Nation’s honored DEAD—
Banners draped and pennons trailing,
Tell how recent joy has fled.

2. Armies, on to vict’ry pressing,
Move with slow and measured tread;
Liberty, her hills caressing,
Folds the wing above her DEAD.
Morning in the East was breaking
When the sunset shades appear,
Anthems on our harps were waking,
Blending into dirges drear.

3. While the sorrow of a nation
Breathes in on deep, suff’’ring sigh,
Thou, O Lord, art our salvation,
Bid our stars illume the sky!
Mighty God, who draped our banner,
Raise it in thy smile again,—
May our grief, like heavenly manna,
Leave rich blessings on he plain!
