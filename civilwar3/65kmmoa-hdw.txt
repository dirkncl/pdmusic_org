  In the battle o Gettysburgh, a young and brave New England soldier, who had fearlessly
faced the leaden hail, was mortally wounded.  Thro' the dark and lonely night he lay upon the
gory field.  When found by his comrades nest morning, and ere death here his heroic spirit
to a better clime, in a half unconscious state he exclaimed, "O! my dear, dear mother! I would
that you were here beside me! my pain is almost gone, Kiss me mother once again!" After
repeating these sweet sentences with youthful ardor, his soul passed from earth as calmy as
that of an innocent cherub upon its mother's breast.

1. On a field of bloody carnage
  Where the gory wavelets swell,
Over wan and ghastly warriors,
  Who have noble fought and fell,
Lay a young and daring soldier
  Weary, wounded bleeding, fair!
But a smile o’erspread his features,
  Such as angels only wear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh he breathed the sweetest music,
For it eased his heart’s dull pain,
It was soft, and low, and gentle;
Kiss me mother once again.

2. In the pale and sickly moonlight,
  Thro’ the night, so long and drear,
Sad and lonely, Will was lying,
  With no loving comrade near;
But the morning broke in splendor,
  And the warclouds rolled away;
Then they fought our bleeding hero
  Where the wounded thickest lay.

3. There he lay in peaceful slumber,
  Like an Infant’s quiet sleep
And as warriors strewn around him,
  Breaking hearts in sorrow weep;
But sweet Liberty and Union,
  And our starry banner bright,
He had marched into the battle,
  And had fallen in the fight.

4. Smiles of sweet angelic beauty
  O’er his placed features spread.
And his eyelids slowly opened;
  Gently, softly, Willie said,
“Comrades! tell my darling mother,
  I am freed from earthly pain,
But I longed once more to see her,
  Kiss me mother once again!”

5. Like pure rays of fadeless splendor
  Seemed our brother’s features fair,
As his breath came slow and feeble,
  And he left this world of care;
But a host of happy angles
  Bore his spirit to the sky,
And we know his end was peaceful,
  He was not afraid to die!
