"LITTLE
TAD" [30 May 1865]
BALLAD
Words & Music by
J. W. TURNER.

"TAD" the pet name of President Lincoln's youngest son __ 
He was a great favorite with his father, as may be inferred 
from the fact that Mrs. Lincoln while at the bedside of her 
dying husband, exclaimed, 'O! bring our "TAD" here! for he 
loves "TAD" so well that I know he will speak to him!'

1. God bless the little orphan boy!
  A father’s darling pride,
May heaven guard his youthful form,
  And be his hope and guide;
May that pure love and honest worth
  Which fill’d his parent’s heart,
Be his inheritance in life
  The good and gen’rous part.

2. Bereft of a fond father’s love,
  And his paternal care;
Without his sacred teachings, or
  His warm devoted prayer.
O, earth must seem so dreary now
  To that dear orphan child—
How he will miss the loving one,
  That so oft on him smiled.

3. But yet there’s left a mother’s love
  To watch his youthful years,
For them, a nation’s sympathy,
  For them a nation’s tears,
Columbia never can forget
  The kindred of her Friend,
And for the little orphan boy
  E’er will her love extend.
