1. The scenes of our Childhood where many have past 
The brightest of moments, too lovely to last, 
Those scenes we remember how often when years 
Have roll’d o’er this bleak world of sorrows, and cares.
Yet tis not the scen’ry alone can impart 
A feeling of sorrow, or joy, to the heart;
Though often some valley, or some meadow gay, 
Reminds us of friends that are far, far away.

2. But oh! when we think of or gaze in the spot, 
Where friendship once bound us, will that be forgot?
Will years that endear’d us to many a friend, 
Ere long be forgotten, and thus will they end?
Oh no they will cling to our meory when 
Those friends of our youth we can ne’er meet again!
That Valley, the Village or meaow so gay 
Will dear to us be then, till life’s latest day.
