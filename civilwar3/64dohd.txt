1. Dreams of happier days,
  How they can cheer the heart,
And to the tempest toss’d
  A soothing balm impart.
Sweet thoughts of tender love,
  That comes like sunbright rays,
And wakes each tender chord.
  Dreams of happier days,
  Dreams of happier days.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dreams of happier days,
Softly o’er us stealing,
Each sunny spot of life
Unto the mind revealing.

2. Dreams of happier days
  That still unchanged remain,
Though years may pass between
  Return to us again.
The vision of the past
  Then manhood’s strength decays,
The thoughts their memory prized,
  Dreams of happier days,
  Dreams of happier days.

3. Dreams of happier days
  That come like summer dew,
Unto the drooping flowers
  And all their strength renew.
And ties that bind the heart
  Through all its changeful ways,
And golden links of life,
  Dreams of happier days,
  Dreamd of happier days.
