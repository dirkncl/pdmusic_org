1. Bear him along the fallen brave,
Bear him along the fallen brave,
Upon the hard and well worn blier,
There yawns for him a new made grave,
Beside his comrades resting here.
  Bear him along the fallen brave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Beat the drums softly, tread the earth lightly.
Bring him forth gently within his sable bed;
We bear a holy burden, the ashes of our hero,
Who perish’d for his country: do honor to the dead.

2. We’ve laid them down, yes, one by one,
Friends, fathers, brothers, kinsmen true,
Friends, fathers, brothers, kinsmen true;
The heroes of Fort Donaldson,
Of Shiloh and of Vicksburg too.
  Bear him along the fallen brave.

3. What manly form shall next repose
Upon his country’s altar slain,
Upon his country’s altar slain;
None but the God of battle knows,
Whose only right it is to reign.
  Bear him along the fallen brave.
