1. For three long years hath Desolation
  This land of Plenty made its own;
For three long years hath Desolation
  The seeds of hatred broadcast sown.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Deal gentle, Lord!
Deal mildly, Lord!
Thy name we bless,
And pow’r confess.
Deal gentle, Lord!
Dear gently,
Deal mildly, Lord!
Deal mildly,
Thy name we bless,
And pow’r confess.

2. For three long years must dire Dissention
  Columbia’s sons both kept apart;
For three long years most wild Contention
  Hath turn’d to gall the Nation’s heart.

3. For three long years hath War unholy
  Shed brother’s blood by brothers ta’an,
Brought Death to homes of high and lowly,
  And reddened Earth with countless slain.

4. Three years hath Heaven, vengeance reaping
  On Man with lust of wealth grown wild,
Filled all the land with widows weeping,
  And orphan made full many a child.
