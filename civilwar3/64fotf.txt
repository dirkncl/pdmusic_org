1. Over the Land no more,
From farthest shore to shore
Shall Slavery’s Legions pour,
Flag of the Free!
No more an angry God
Smite with His fearful rod,
For lowly ones downtrod,
Flag of the Free!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Fling out thy folds anew
Flag of the Free!
Onward Red, White and Blue,
For Liberty!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Fling out thy folds anew
Flag of the Free!
Onward Red, White and Blue,
For Liberty!

2. Where’er thy folds shall wave,
There shall the true and brave
All men from bondage save,
Flag of the Free!
Proudly thy name we breathe,
Proudly thy staff unwreathe,
Marching thy light beneath,
Flag of the Free!

3. God’s smile shall on thee rest,
Hope of the poor opprest,
A halo ever blest,
Flag of the Free!
Living, with loud acclaim,
Thy sons thy praises frame,
Dying we bless thy name,
Flag of the Free!
