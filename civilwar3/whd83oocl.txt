1. 
Once more each other greeting,
With wellcome warm and true,
The pledge of sacred friendship,
Today our hearts renew,
And now our op’ning chorus sing,
Let every voice awake
In music’s tuneful measure,
We’ll breathe our soul felt pleasure,
And send the chorus far away,
On old Chautauqua Lake.

CHORUS
On old Chautauqua Lake,
Let every voice awake,
On old Chatauqua Lake,
We’ll sacred friendship pledge. 
Beautiful Lake now 
Joyfully wake Beautiful Lake

2. 
We praise our kind Protector,
Who still our guide has been,
Whose loving hand has kept us,
And brought us here again;
Where sweetest birds and flowers,
Their summer dwellings make
And calmly gently flowing,
A mystic charm bestowing,
We hear the cool and charming waves,
Of old Chautauqua Lake.

3. 
O happy happy greeting,
Each heart with rapture thrills,
We love thy name Chautauqua,
We love thy bright green hills,
Thy shady groves and fairy dells,
Whose sleeping echoes wake
To catch its tuneful measure,
Our song of purest pleasure,
And send the chorus far away,
Along the Silver Lake.
