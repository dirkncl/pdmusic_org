1. Through all the Great Republic,
  Give thanks to God on high!
Rejoice with adoration,
  Wheree’r our Eagles fly!
Brave loyal Union Armies,
  By Providence sustain’d,
Thro’ thousand battles struggling,
  Have crowning triumph gained—
Thro’ thousand battles struggling,
  Have crowning triumph gained.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then honor to the Soldiers—
  The gallant and the true—
Brave champions of the Starry Flag—
  The Red, the White and Blue—
The Red, the White and Blue—
  The Red. the White and Blue—
Brave champions of the Starry Flag—
  The Red, the White and Blue.

2. The Lightning flashing freely
  Across our broad domain,
Proclaims the land’s REDEMPTION
  From SLAVERY’S GALLING CHAIN.
The NATION rises disenthrall’d
  From its infernal sway—
From long dark night of sorrow,
  Now gleams a brighter day.
From long dark night of sorrow,
  Now gleams a brighter day.

3. The horrors of the dungeon,
  The carnage of the field,
Our Soldiers met undaunted—
  Their blood our triumph seal’d.
The Relics of our Armies,
  Ennobled by their scars,
Deserve a NATION’S WELCOME—
  WARM WELCOME FROM THE WARS.
Deserve a NATION’S WELCOME—
  WARM WELCOME FROM THE WARS.

4. The Nation’s gallant Martyrs!
  Slain Champions of the Right!—
Their names are brightly blazon’d
  In Glory’s living light!
Throughout a grateful Nation,
  From mountain to the sea,
Their memories are hallow’d
  With blessings of the Free!
Their memories are hallow’d
  With blessings of the Free!

5. O parents, sisters, brothers,
  Whose hearts are rent by wo,
Rejoice in Freedom’s triumph—
  Tears should no longer flow:—
The Union Cause, the Starry Flag,
  For which your lov’dones fell,
By Heaven’s aid have conquer’d,
  And all’s now going well.
By Heaven’s aid have conquer’d,
  And all’s now going well.
