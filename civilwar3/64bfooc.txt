1. Bright flag of our country:
How proudly she waves,
O’er the land and the sea,
And patriot graves.
Now gallantly streaming,
She rides on the breeze,
The pride of our nation;
The queen of the seas.

CHORUS 1
Bright flag of our country!
How proudly she waves,
O’er the land and the sea
And patriot graves,
Now gallantty streaming,
She rides on the breeze,
The pride of our nation,
The queen of the seas.

2. Though foes did assail us,
In fiercest affray,
The sword of our fathers,
Hath led us the way
And yonder bright banner,
Of white, blue and red,
Still floats in sweet triumph,
From ev’ry mast head.

CHORUS 2
Though foes did assail us,
In fiercest affray,
The sword of our fathers,
Hath led us the way,
And yonder bright banner,
Of white, blue and red,
Still floats in sweet triumph,
From ev’ry mast head.

3. Bright flag of our country,
With glories unfurl’d,
Thou breakest all darkness,
To illumine the world—
Oh! may thy folds gleaming,
Unspotted still be,
And heaven desert us,
When we desert thee.

CHORUS 3
Bright flag of our country,
With glories unfurl’d,
Thou breakest all darkness
To illumine the world,
Oh! may thy folds gleaming,
Unspotted still be,
And heaven desert us,
When we desert thee.
