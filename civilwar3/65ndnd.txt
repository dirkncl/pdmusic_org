"Now Den! Now Den!" (9 Dec 1865; 6 Jul 1893)
The Freedman's Song
Song & Chorus
by Benjamin Russell Hanby, 1833-1867

Note:  The object of “Ole Shady” was to encourage the
contrabands to escape from their masters to the Union lines,
and was suggested by the correspondence between General Butler,
and the authorities of Washington, with regard to the status of
escaped slaves. The song in a very short time become known all
over the South as the “Contraband Song” and was sung by the
slaves everywhere, though very few at the North had as yet heard
it. In like manner it is hoped that this song, while furnishing
amusement in the social-circle, may subserve the further and more
important purpose of inducing the Freedmen— to return to their
homes and labor.

1. De darkies say dis many a day,
We’s far from de land ob Canaan.
Oh! whar shall we go from de white faced foe,
Oh! whar shall we find our Canaan.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Now den! Now den! into de cotten darkies.
Plow in de can till ye reach de berry bottom darkies.
Ho! we go for de rice swamp low.
Hurrah for de land ob Canaan.

2. Oh happy day de darkies say,
For at last “we’ve” found our Canaan.
Old Jordan’s flood roll’d red with blood,
But we march’d right ober into Canaan.

3. No driver’s horn calls de slave at morn.
Jordan swamp’d him crossing into Canaan.
But at break ob day we’er away, we’re away,
For to till de fertile fields ob Canaan.

4. Come ye runaway’s back dat underground track
Couldn’t neber neber lead you into Canaan.
Here your fathers sleep;. here your loved ones weep.
O come home to the happy land ob Canaan.

CHORUS: To be Sung after Chorus to last Stanza.
Oh! Canaan sweet Canaan, we’s been hunting for de land ob Canaan.
Canaan is now our happy home.
Hurrah for de land ob Canaan.
