1. On our lovers. brotjers, friends,
Our liberty depends,
Our champions are our soldiers;
Our louder songs of praise,
In their honor we will raise,
And sing to the boys of the Army.

CHORUS 1-3.
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah for the Boys of the Army,
Hurrah for the sons of their land,
No traitor can encroach,
No foe can e’er approach,
While oppos’d by the boys of the army.

2. Now this cruel was has ceas’d,
And we’ve gain’d a happy peace,
We will honor the boys of the army;
Who have fought, bled, and won,
’Neath a sultry southern sun,
Laurels for the boys of our Army.

3. Then let the girls at home,
Cheer the noble boys who roam,
Our roads, hills, and dales in the army;
For encourag’d by our smiles,
They will foil all traitors wiles,
And return happy heroes from our Army.
