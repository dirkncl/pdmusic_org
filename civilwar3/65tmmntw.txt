1. Tell my mother when you see her
That I fell amid the strife
And for freedom and my country
I have given up my life.
Tell here that I sent this message
Ere my tongue refused to speak.
And you tell her comrad wont you
Tell my mother not to weep.

CHORUS 1-3.
Comrad when you see her
Tell her not to weep.
Not to weep when you see her
Tell my mother not to weep.

2. Tell my mother how we parted
For our country and the right
How I held the starry banner
In the thickest of the fight.
Tell her how they struggled for it
And with curses loud and deep
Took my bosom for their target
But tell her not to weep.

4. Tell her I help up the banner
With the flaming shot and shell
Till the fatal leaden missle
Pierced my side and then I fell.
Tell her I was ready wailing
When my pulses ceased to beat
And I longed once more to see her
But you tell her not to weep.

LAST VERSE
4. Tell her comrad when you see her
That my battle fields are o’er
And I have gone to join an army
Where rebellion is no more.
Tell her that I hope to greet her
When together we shall meet.
In that better home in heaven
Where we never more shall weep.

CHORUS 4.
Comrad when you see her
when you see her
Tell her not to weep
Tell her so gently she may not know
Comrad scared in battle
Tell her not to weep.
