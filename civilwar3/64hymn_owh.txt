1. Father, send on earth again
Peace and good will to men;
Yet, while the weary track of life
Lends thy people through storm and strife,
Help us to walk therein.
  Help us to walk therein.

2. Guide us through the perilous path;
Teach us love that tempers wrath;
Let the fountain of mercy flow
Alike for helpless friend and foe,
  Children all of thine.
  Children all of thine.

3. God of grace, hear our call;
Bless our gifts, Giver of all;
The wounded heal, the captive restore,
And keep us a nation evermore
Faithful to Freedom and Thee!
  Faithful to Freedom and Thee!
