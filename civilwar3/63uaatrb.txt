When “Uncle Abe” took a four years lease of “Uncle Sam’s Farm”,
he found a host of rebellious boys on the trees
stealing apples,
Seeing the injury they were doing,
he most respectfully requested them
to come down;
Upon hearing his solicitations,
the saucy blockheads told him plainly
they would not.
(Spoken. Won’t you, said
“Uncle Abe?“— then I’ll
make you come down.)
So without taking off his white kid gloves, he com
menced throwing at them a quantity of
turf and grass;
This only made the rebels laugh, to think that “Uncle Abe” should
pretend to frighten them down with
grass only.
(Spoken. Well, well confound
you, said “Uncle Abe,” if
neither words nor grass will do.)
I must try what virtue there
is in stones.
So he has taken off his white kid gloves, and is going
to pelt them hertily with stones, until the rascals hasten down
from the trees and beg the
old man’s pardon.
If mild works, and gentle means,
fail to re
claim the wicked,
They must be dealt with in a more s-
e-v-e-r-e manner.
