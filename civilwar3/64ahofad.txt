1. Soft the fall winds sighing,
Thro’ the orange groves.
Fill our hearts with musings
Dreams of those we love,
What though our health restor’d us,
And every prospect fair,
At home our friends are dying,
And we, alas! not there.

2. Resting in the sunlight,
’Neath the orange flow’rs,
Clouds come stealing o’er us,
In our happier hours.
’Tis then we ask God’s blessing,
And lowly breathe a prayer,
For our lone home friends dying,
And we alas! not there.

3. Once we watch beside them,
  Soothed each bitter pang,
Bore with them the anguish,
  Words of comfort sang.
Now our hearts choicest treasures,
  So beautiful and fair,
At home alone are dying,
  And we, alas! not there.

4. There the wife and mother,
  Sister, children dear,
Bear alone their sorrow,
  Shed unchecked the tear.
’Tis there they pine in sadness,
  Beneath their pain and care,
At home they’re slowly dying,
  And we, alas! not there.

5. But the joyful meeting,
  In the brighter Home,
Cheers us in our sadness,
  Wheresoe’er we roam.
For we are coming, dear ones,
  Up to the palace fair,
And in the Glorious morning,
  We’ll meet our treasures there.
