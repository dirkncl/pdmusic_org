1.
All hail to thee, thou grand old flag,
Still floating o'er the free,
New soiled and torn by traitors' hands,
Thou'rt doubly dear to me.
When in my boyhood's early years,
I saw thee first unfurled,
I deemed thee then the pride of the earth,
The glory of the world.

CHORUS 2 times
Glorious old flag!
Dearer than ever to me,
The pride of my youth,
The emblem of truth,
The banner of all the free.

2.
And when in later years I stood,
In busy haunts of men,
And saw thee float, o'er field and flood,
Old flag, I loved thee then!
But now, when in thy glorious light
No slave need cringe or bow--
My father's and my country's flag,
I love thee better now.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
I'll bear thee up, thou dear old flag,
Of origin divine,
Until upon thy azure fold,
A hundred stars shall shine.
Float on, old flag, until thy stripes
Shall all the nations heal,
And tyrants over all the earth
Shall thy just vengence feel.

(CHORUS 2 times)
