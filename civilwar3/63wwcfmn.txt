	During one of our late battles, among many other noble
fellows that fell, was a young man who had been the only support
of an aged and sick mother for years.  Hearing the surgeon tell
those who were near him that he could not live, he placed his
hand across his forehead, and with a trembling voice said, while
burning tears ran down his fevered cheeks:  Who will care for
mother now?

1.
Why am I so weak and weary.
See how faint my heated breath,
All a-round to me seems darkness.
Tell me, comrades, is this death?
Ah! how well I know your answer;
To my fate I meekly bow.
If you'll only tell me truly
Who will care for mother now?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Soon with angels I'll be marching,
With bright laurels on my brow.
I have for my country fallen,
Who will care for mother now?

2.
Who will comfort her in sorrow?
Who will dry the falling tear,
Gently smooth her wrinkled forehead?
Who will whisper words of cheer?
Even now I think I see her
Kneeling, praying for me! how
Can I leave her in her anguish?
Who will care for moth-er now?

3.
Let this knapsack be my pillow,
And my mantle be the sky;
Hasten, comrades, to the battle,
I will like a soldier die.
Soon with angels I'll be marching,
With bright laurels on my brow,
I have for my country fallen,
Who will care for mother now?
