1. Oh send my old man back again, 
  My home is lonely now;
I  miss his dear olde freckled face,
  His smooth and shining brow
I long to hear his heavy tread;
  Oh dear! when shall I see
His noble form walk in the door,
  With a patch upon his knee?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh send him home to me.
  I pray; I’ll check the falling tear;
All dark and dreary seems the world
  Without my old man here.

2. I miss his dear and hearty kiss 
  When he comes from the shop;
With his old hat back of his head,
  With a button on the top;
And evening when we tried to sing,
  So loudly he would shout:
The dear man could not sing a note
  He always put me out.

3. He’s gone and joined the army now 
  To loose his precious life;
I wonder if he ever thinks
  Of me his lonely wife?
My heart with anguish soon would burst
  If my old man was slain:
Oh! drive such cruel thoughts away
  And send him home again.
