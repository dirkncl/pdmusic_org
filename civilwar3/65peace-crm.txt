1. Hark! in the midnight a sound of joy
  From the line of battle far away
Lift up your hearts and your flags deploy
  The soldiers of the Union have won the day.
Brave ones we miss and loving ones we mourn.
  Flowers grow above their head,
But in the Nation’s heart upborne
  Still they live the heroic dead!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hark! in the distance what sound we hear,
  ’Tis the voice of thousands as they come.
Peace victorious, Peace is near,
  Brothers let us shout a welcome Home!

2. Safe floats the Ark of our dear old Union.
  Look now abroad how the waters cease.
Welcome the dove on steady pinion
  Bearing the olive branch of peace.
Throughout the land let all rejoice.
  Once more shall peace and plenty reign.
Sing with a Nation’s heart and voice:
  Glory in the Highest, Good Will toward all men!

*"Let the Flag Be Draped in Mourning"

The preceding verses and music were written under the
inspiration of the news of Lee's surrender, for the
Amateur Concert which was to be given by Mrs. Moultin
at Mr. Jerome's Theatre for the benefit of the Woman's
Hospital. In the mean time, the Nation was thrown into
the deepest affliction by the assignation of President
Lincoln, and the following words, written for the
occasion by Mr. W. J. Hoppin, were substituted, when
the Concert took plac, for those of the original Hymn.

*1. Let the flag be draped in mourning,
  Let the funeral march be played;
He who led the hosts of Freedom,
  Falls, by the traitor hands betrayed!
Hark! the minute guns resounding,
  Bear the news from shore to shore
His great heart, so true and tender,
  For his country beats no more!

*CHORUS 1
Toll, ye bells, the mournful story!
  Speak, ye guns, from shore to shore!
His great heart, so brave and loyal,
  For his country beats no more!

*2. Lo! the war cloud torn and scattered,
  Lets a brighter vision through!
North and South, the sky is blazing,
  With the Red, the White and Blue!
Though the Leader falls, the banner
  Still in matchless glory flies;
Fot the Nation lives for ever,
  And 'tis only Treason dies!

*CHORUS 2
Let the bells ring out the tidings,
  Let the joyful cannon roar;
Truth and Right shall win the battle,
  Peace and Union reign once more!
