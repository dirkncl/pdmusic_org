"Kiss Me, Father, Ere I Die" (1865)

(An Incident of the present War.)

  An only boy, whose mother had died in infancy, was brought home
to his father's house to die from the effects of exposure in camp. On his
death bed his constant petition was whenever his father approached him,
"Kiss me father, ere I die," and down to his very last moments he clung to
this request, and finally died in his father's arms, "As a weary child going to
sleep."

1. Dearest father, I am going
To a brighter, better clime.
Soon my eyes will close forever,
Shutting out the things of time;
Raise my head upon my pillow,
Let my feel that you are nigh,
Press me to your aching bosom.
Kiss me, father, ere I die.

2. Father I have done my duty,
In the camp and ’mid the strife.
Soon I’ll seal my deep devotion
To my country with my life;
But it soothes my dying moments,
When I know that you are by,
Put your loving arms aound me.
Kiss me, father, ere I die.

3. Kiss me father, as you used to
In my childhood’s happy day,
When I nestled in your bosom,
Ere your locks had turn’d to grey;
Cast a loving glance upon me
As within yous arms I lie.
I am going, God be with you.
Kiss me, father, ere I die.
