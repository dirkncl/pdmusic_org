1. They all came home but mine again—
Why lingers he so long away?
I gaze in evˆry face in vain,
And watch thro’ all the weary day.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
No more! my darling, my boy no more will come,—
He sleeps by Rappahannock’s wave;—
Sweet birds, O sing him songs of home—
Kind angels, guard his lonely grave.

2. How sad his dying words to hear:
“Oh mother, mother, give me bread!”
To hear him ask “is mother near?—
O smooth my aching, weary head!”

3. Thro’ all the night I hear his cry:
“Oh give me bread— O take me home,—
So sad to die with no one nigh,
And to my grave no sister come.”

4. No mother’s prayer, no sister’s tear,
To soothe his dying hour so lone,—
Thus died my boy with no one near;
He sleeps in lonely grave unknown.
