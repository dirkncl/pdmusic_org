1. Our noble boys are coming,
Coming from the war,
  Give them a hearty welcome home;
Let now our songs of gladness
Echo o’er and o’er.
  Give them a hearty welcome home.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
To their homes returning,
Now the heroes come.
Swell forth the song of gladness,
Cheer them on their way.
Give them a hearty welcome home.

2. With wreaths of laurel crown them.
They have glory won;
  Give them a hearty welcome home;
Right nobly have they battled—
Now their tast is done—
  Give them a hearty welcome home.

3. To peaceful scenes returning,
Come the hero bands,
  Give them a hearty welcome home.
With greatful hearts we grasp
Their onest sun brown’d hands,
  Give them a hearty welcome home.

4. With joyous songs we cheer them,
And our tribute pay;
  Give them a hearty welcome home.
We’ll scatter sweetest garlands
In their happy way.
  Give them a hearty welcome home.
