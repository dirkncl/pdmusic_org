1. “Kiss me goodbye! my dear” he said.
When I come back we will wed, we will wed!
Crying she kiss’d him “goodbye my Ned!”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
And the soldier follow’d the drum, the drum,
The echoing, echoing drum, the drum,
The echoing, echoing drum;
Rataplan, rataplan, rataplan, follow me each true man,
Living or dying then strike while you can!
Strike while you can!

2. Proudly and firmly marched off the men,
Who had a true heart thought of her then,
Tears were coming, but brave lips smiled
When the [soldier followed the drum.]

3. One with a woman’s curl next his heart,
He felt her last smile pierce like a dart!
She thought my heartstrings will break when we part
From the [soldier who followed the drum.]
