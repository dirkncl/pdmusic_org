1. Oh dark the day, and dark the hour, 
When TREASON in her height of power, 
With all her gathered legions came, 
To waste the North with sword and flame! 
Right onward, swift exultant, proud, 
With burning wrath and curses loud, 
Upto yon chain of hills they crowd, 
The rocky hills of Gettysburg.

2. As ocean waves roll mountain high, 
Beneath the tempestblackened sky, 
And rush with fury on the shore, 
And rage, and dash with awful roar, 
So burst the foemen on that band, 
The heroes of the Fatherland, 
As firm on Freedom’s dyke they stand, 
The rocky hills of Gettysburg.

3. In vain their utmost strength is hurled 
’Mid thunders that might shake the world; 
Back from the adamantine wall 
Their broken ranks to terror fall, 
And slow retire with sullen mien, 
While slaughtered thousands strew the scene, 
The vale of death that lies between, 
The rocky hills of Gettysburg.

4. The Lord has heard his people’s prayer,
And blessed the starry banner there;
For soon as Freedom’s soil was red
With freemen’s blood in battle shed
By rebel hands— their doom was sealed;
The sacrifice to Heaven appealed,
The Altar, theat ensanguined field,
The rocky hills of Gettysburg.

5. In nameless grave the traitors sleep,
Where none shall ever come to weep;
But for her martyred sons, with tears,
A monument the nation rears,
And age to age shall pass it down,
The story of their bright renown,
And everlasting fame shall crown
The rocky hills of Gettysburg.
