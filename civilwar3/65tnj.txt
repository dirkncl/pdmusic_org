1. Fling out the nation’s starry flag
In glory on the air!
The ancient flag of freedom still:
No star is missing there.
The Lord of hosts has giv’n the word,
The people all are free:
The Jubilee hath sounded forth,
The nations liberty!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Shout! our redemption’s come!
Our nation now is free!!!
Echo the chorus wide;
Proclaim the Jubilee!

2. The dove of Peace is brooding o’er
The desolated earth;
And flow’rs are springing in the light
Of freedom’s second birth.
Then from the field of battle call
Our noble veterans home;
Sing out the joyous bells and greet,
The heroes as they come.
