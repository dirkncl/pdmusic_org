1. O search ye well the lists, dear mother,
You’ll find your darling’s name therein,
Who fighting for his Country’s honor,
Fell amid the battle’s din.
O weep not for your boy, dear mother,
No prouder death than mine could be,
I die that others may be happy,
I die for country and for thee.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh weep no for your boy, dear mother,
No prouder death than mine could be.
I  die that others may be happy—
I die for country and for thee.

2. I left thy happy home, dear mother,
Our hearts were parted with a sigh,
Yet neither thought in that sad hour,
Or dreamt that death could be so nigh.
I felt, however sad the parting,
That brave old Flag must be upheld.
And hearts, that loving well their country
Must fight, by patriot love impelled.

3. I weep to think of thee, dear mother,
’Tis sad to think thou are alone
Oh could you e’er again be happy,
I’d gladly die without a moan.
Yet mother, dear, our country’s children,
Will bless you on their bended knee.
For him who loved his country’s honor,
Who died that others might be free.
