1A. I’ve just dropp’d in, Miss Minikin,
  Quite in a quiet way, dear,
To have a chat ’bout this and that,
  And hear what you’ve to say, dear;
You’ll quite agree my dear, with me,
  You know it’s quite essential—
That what we say this quiet way,
  Is strictly confidential.

1B. Of course you’ve seen the match between
  Dear Kate and Joe is over,
I really grieve yet can’t conceive
  How he could ever love her;
Upon my word she’s quite absurd,
  So over deferential,
Mind what we say this quiet way
  Is strictly confidential.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE's A and B
except Verse 3, which sings it only the "second" [B] time]
Yes you’ll agree my dear, with me,
  You know it’s quite essential—
That what we say, this quiet way,
  Is strictly confidential.

2A. Now you shall hear a secret, dear,
  I feel quite sure he’ll offer,
I should not be surpris’d if he
  His heart and hand should proffer;
You know he’s prov’d that he has mov’d
  In circles influential;
Mind, what we say this quiet way,
  Is strictly confidential.

2B. Oh, that’s delightful news tonight!
  You think I shall not lose hime?
I’ll own, if he propos’d to me,
  I could not well refuse him.
Now, dear, you’t tell me how to quell
  My heart and be prudential,
For what you say this quiet way
  Is strictly confidential.

3A. Forgive me, dear you don’t appear
  To understand me rightly,
It is to me be seems to be
  Inclin’d to act politely;
Now throw aside your wounded pride,
  I promise, dear, you then shall
As bridesmaid go but this you know,
  Is strictly confidential.

3B. Propose to you! that’s something new!
  What’s this? a scented letter!
This morn, at eight, he wedded Kate!
  I really now feel better.
Now pray don’t swoon, so very soon,
  My dear Miss Consequential,
I promise you our interview
  Is strictly confidential.
