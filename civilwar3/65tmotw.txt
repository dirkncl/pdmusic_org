  In a speech delivered to Illinoi by Hon. John A. Logan, when
about to take the field as Colonel of the Thirty-First Regiment of
Volunteers from Illinois, that distinguished patriot and soldier
used the characteristic expression that "The men of the west would
hew their way to the Gulf, with their swords."

1.
You remember, my boys, when our Colonel first spoke,
You remember the glorious words that he said,
When the terrible storm of rebellion first broke,
When he spoke as he wav'd his bright sword o'er his head.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! the men of the west for such fighting are best,
No better there ever could be,
They deliver'd a land that was foully oppress'd,
As they hew'd thero way down to the sea.

2.
We have done as he told us, have fought the good fight,
And clear'd from our pathway the vile Cotton Lords,
As he said we would do for the Union and Right;
We have hew'd our way down to the Gulf with our swords.

3.
Now joy t us boys! for our victory's won,
We have clean'd out the nests of the traitorous hords,
Our work has been done, has been thoroughly done,
We have hew'd our way down to the Gulf with our swords.

4.
But our work is not finished: the men of the west
With Grant and with Logan, and such men to lead,
Must hew their way still without stopping to rest,
Till the whole of the land from rebellion is freed.
