1. Yes, I know thou art praying to night, Mother,
  And I feel thou art praying for me,
For it comes o’er my soul like a vision of light,
  And I know thou art praying for me.

[Refrain] and CHORUS 1-4.
In my bosom all care is at rest, Mother,
  No longer by sorrow oppressed,
O, I know thou art praying tonight, Mother,
  And I know thou art praying for me.

2. I have fought for the Union and right, Mother,
  I have stood by the flag of the free;
That Banner so fair fair, with its colors so bright,
  ’Twas the pride of our nation and thee.

3. There’s a chill on my forehead to night, Mother,
  I am dying far distant from thee;
But the star of my faith is unclouded and bright,
  For I know thou art praying for me.

4. I am going to Jesus above, Mother,
  With the pure and the blest I shall be;
But my spirit will guard thee in love, dear Mother,
  Till wafted by angels to me.
