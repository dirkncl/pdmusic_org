1. Oh! Father of all, our hearts beat with joy,
Thy mercy prevails, let naught now alloy;
Forgive us our folly and bind us in love,
Forgive us Almighty, who reigneth above.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Forgive us our folly and bind us in love,
Forgive us Almighty who reigneth above.

2. A nation we are, a nature we’ll stand!
If love be the bond that holds this fair land,
Then union and peace will forever more reign
Supreme o’er the land that now grieves for her slain.

3. We may not accuse a brother of wrong,
For God is our judge, to him we belong;
But let us endeavor forgiveness to share,
Uniting with one voice, in praises and pray’r.
