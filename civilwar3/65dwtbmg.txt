1. Now I come to thee my darling
Come to bid a fond good bye,
Ere I leave for fields of conflict,
Where our nation’s martyr’s lie,
Loudly cries their blood for vengence
Vengence on their trait’rous foe,
And I ask thy sanction loved one,
Dearest will thou bid me go?
And I ask thy sanction loved one,
Dearest will thou bid me go?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For in blood our flag to trailing,
And its stars have ceased to glow,
Shall I go and help defend it
Dearest, Dearest,
Dearest will thou bid me go!

2. Oft we’ve wandered in the moonlight
’Neath the azure arch of blue,
And beneath God’s stargemed banner
We exchanged our vows so true.
And the stars that looked upon us
With a calm and pensive light
Now look down upon our heroes,
Striving to sustain their right,
Now look down upon our heroes,
Striving to sustain their right.

3. Dearest if my blood should mingle
In the dark and purple sea,
Should the though of me bring sorrow
Shouldst thou weep, my love, for me.
Wouldst thou think of the devotion,
Of the love I gave to you,
How to thee and God and country,
I endevored to be true,
How to thee and God and country,
I endevored to be true.

4. Father, Mother, brother, sister,
All have bid their last adieu.
And I come to thee my darling
Come to ask consent of you.
Wilt thou give me thine own blessing,
Bless me ere I go awat.
Surely thou wouldst urge me forward,
No Thou wouldst not bid me stay,
Surely thou wouldst urge me forward,
No Thou wouldst no bid me stay!
