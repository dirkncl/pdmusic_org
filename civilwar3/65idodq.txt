1. Since I’ve become a soldier things have gone so very queer,
  Some say that I’m a one year some a three years volunteer
With plenty of likes and dislikes to all I have to stick
  It’s nothing but salt pork hard tack and plenty of Double Quick.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! I’m misrable! I’m misrable! to all I have to stick
The old salk horse is passable
But I’m down on Double Quick.

2. Every morn at five precisely the reveille will sound
  And then theres such a scamp’ring time you’ll have to fly around
Before you get your breakfast ’tis enough to make you sick
  To give the men an appetite they give them Double Quick.

3. You may feel rather hungry almost in a starving state
  And wish to get your dinner first all ready with your plate.
There are always others just the same waiting for their lick
  To get your grub the twentieth one just travel Double Quick.

4. And once on every sunday to church they’ll make you go.
  Your bayonet by your side for fear you’ll meet a foe.
And when the service ends ’tis called a moral trick
  To drive you back to camp at a pleasant Double Quick.

5. Each day there are twelve roll calls to keep you in the camp.
  If off three rods the bugle sounds then back you’ll have to tramp.
And if one you should chance to miss why you’re a poor gone chick,
  Fourteen bricks in your knapsack and four hours Double Quick.

6. Friends dont think that I am weary of the soldiers life I lead
  For oh I deem it happiness for the Union cause to bleed.
Young men if you will help up the rebs’ down south to lick
  To old Harry we’ll send traitors at a headlong Double Quick.
