1.
Dreams of childhood softly throw
Their genial beams a round,
And through the weary heart the glow,
And joys of youth rebound.
Though oft the through life the dreary way
Of sorrow breaks to view,
And fortune's fickle glit'ring ray,
Too often proves untrue.

[REFRAIN]
Yet dreams of childhood softly throw
Their genial beams around,
And throug the weary heart the glow,
And joys of youth rebound.

CHORUS
Happy days, happy days,
Dreams of childhood softly throw.
Happy days, happy days,
Pleasant dreams of long ago.

2.
Oh would that once again that hour,
So joyous could be seen,
That once in childhood's flow'r,
We frollicked on the green,
But faded now is ev-ery you,
Of childhood that we cherished,
And bliss so pure without alloy
With that sweet time has perished.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
Now pleasant 'mid the cares and fears
Of daily toil to look,
Thro' the vista of increasing years
To that sequestered nook,
Where in the flush of youthful glee,
Our hearts elate with pleasure,
We frolicked o'er the hill and lea,
Nor thought of sordid treasure.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
