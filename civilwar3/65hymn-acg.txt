1. There is a land where strife shall cease,
Where arms shall clash no more,
Where all is calm content and peace,
Lord bring us to that shore.

CHORUS 1­-2.
In the rough tent, in the wild tent,
In the marches by the way,
Be Thou the soldiers comforter,
His strength, his staff, his stay.

2. About the graves of good men gone
Make thou the graves to shine,
Our armies lead to vict’ry on,
And make their vict’rys thine.

3. And when we’ve done with life’s events,
When the dark shadows fall,
Help us O Lord, to strike our tents,
For the last march of all.

CHORUS 3.
To the sad tent, to the sick tent,
To the dying tent come down,
And gem the rough wood of the cross,
With blossoms of the crown.
