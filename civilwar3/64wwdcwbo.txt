1. Ob de time for de ’mancipation’s come, I’m told,
We’re all gwine for solgers soon;
We will leab our old massa’s way out in de cold,
For to mow and to hoe all alone.
Let de darkies place de Oberseer now fill,
While we shoulder up de gun;
And go gib our rebel massa’s some of Fader A’brams pills,
For de dark’s ’mancipation time has come.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dem let’s shout, shout, shout, make dem cussed traitors run,
Let em know what good Union men are we;
We will make our ole massa’s wish dis war had ne’er began,
Kaze we’ll ’mancipated be.

2. We was once all as happy as poor nig’s could be,
Down South in our good ole home;
As we work’d in de cotton fields so merrily,
Or when play’n on de ole jau bone.
But our massa’s dey went crazy mad one day,
’Twas down at Montgomeree;
Dey all declar’d de was Secessions, den de debil was to pa,y—
Says ole Jeff, “now de President I’ll be.”

3. Oh I wish dat dis bery cruel war would end
And gib us poor dark’s a rest;
But dere’s one ting dats bery sure, you may depend,
Dat de nig’s will go in for de best.
But to get us back again de neber can,
For to hoe de sugar cane;
Till our massa’s can behave demselves and mind ole Uncle Sam,
Dem we’ll go’n work de cotton fields again.
