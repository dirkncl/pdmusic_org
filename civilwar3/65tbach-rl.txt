1. A song, a song today:
  The boys so long away
Are coming home with victory:
  They bear from battle rout,
  With not a gem left out,
The starry banner of the free.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O! the boys are coming home,
The boys are coming home,
With banners torn and tattered,
With columns worn and shattered:
The battle work is done,
The victory is won.
And the flags are out, with song and shout,
For the boys are coming home.

2. From hill to briny shore,
  They sought the battle’s roar.
They conquered every rebel clan:
  And by the blood they shed—
  The living and the dead—
They purchased Liberty for Man.

3. O! sing a song today,
  For those who met the fray
At mountain crest and ocean foam,
  Who made at treason’s grave
  A land without a slave—
We greet them— “brave boys, welcome home!”
