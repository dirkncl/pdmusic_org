1. See the light now gently glowing, 
Gliding mountain top and tree;
See the morn now brightly breaking, 
On the day of Jubilee.
Hearts crush’d down by weight of sorrow;
Hearts bow’d down with grief and care;
Swell with joy, to greet the coming 
Of the day to them so dear.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Shout aloud the Hallelujah.
Shout the cry of victory.
For the morn is brightly breaking 
O’er the land forever free.

2. Now the captive’s chains are severed, 
And the handcuffs rent in twain;
Now the lash lies by unheeded, 
Never to be used again.
Shout aloud the glad Hosanna!
And let joy dispel all gloom;
Spread abroad the happy tidings, 
Slav ry has found its tomb.

3. What is that which proudly floating
In the dawning light appears?
’Tis the flag the Slave has cherished,
’Tis the flag the tyrant fears;
List! its rustling folds make music
Sweet unto the captive’s ear,
Telling of the happy future
To the bondman, drawing near.

4. Many noble hearts have perished,
And upon the battle plain,
Lie the bleaching bones of martyrs
In the cause of Freedom slain;
Heal, Oh! God, the hearts now breaking
And our earnest prayers O hear!
Comfort Thou, the suffering orphan,
Dry the weeping widow’s tear.
