1. When peace throughout Columbia’s land,
Had made the nation great
A demon rose with steelclad hand,
Who burn’d with rage and hate
And jealous of her wellearn’d fame
He raised a trait’rous band
To aid him in secesion’s name
To desolate the land
But patriots true, their falchions drew
For God and Liberty,
Liberty
Throughout the land they took their stand,
For God and Liberty.

2. Columbia rais’d in Freedom’s name
The Red and White and Blue
And we will e’er protect her fame,
Her starry banner too
No despot will we ever know
The people to enthrall
No foreign knave or native for
Shall foe obedience call
Our cry shall be, on land or sea
For God and Liberty
Liberty
Our cause is just, in Heaven we trust
For God and Liberty.

3. When all the storms of war are o’er
And peace crowns ev’ry hill
Her rainbow bright from Heav’n once more,
Shall show our colors still
Our children’s children then shall feel,
And prouder still shall tell
We saved our freedom by our steel
Though many a hero fell
As brazen throats with thunder roar’d
For God and Liberty
Liberty
Columbia’s cry shall reach the sky
For God and Liberty.
