1. Come gather round the Union flag,
Hurra! Hurra!
From hill and dale and mountain crag,
Hurra! Hurra!
United, it shall ever wave,
O’er ev’ry loyal heart and brave,
And no traitor knave,
Shall tarnish the dear old Flag,
  And no traitor knave,
  Shall tarnish the dear old Flag.

2. In days of yore our fathers bled,
Hurra, Hurra,
They bravely marched with conquering tread,
Hurra, Hurra,
They drove the foemen from the land,
A hireling host, a tyrant band,
And we’ll firmly stand,
And cherish the dear old Flag,
  And we’ll firmly stand,
  And cherish the dear old Flag.

3. What tho’ a rebel horder shall come,
Hurra, Hurra,
With a bugle blast and rolling drum,
Hurra, Hurra,
We’ll sweep them from the battle plain,
As reapers sweep the ripen’d grain
And with might and main,
We’ll stand by the dear old Flag,
  And with might and main,
  We’ll stand by the dear old Flag.

4. Then round our standard circle all,
Hurra, Hurra,
A phalanx ne’er to fear or fall,
Hurra, Hurra,
United let us ever be,
A band of brothers stout and free
And with three times three,
We’ll shout for the dear old Flag,
  And with three times three,
  We’ll shout for the dear old Flag.
