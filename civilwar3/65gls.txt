1. I never can forget the day,
Lee and his soldiers had to part,
There was many a tear to wipe away,
And many a sad and weary heart.

CHORUSES 1-4 only
For the soldier had to past with his rifle,
His trusty companion lay aside,
While his heart, felt emotions he must stifle
As he yielded up Virginia his pride.

2. Bravely and well that noble band,
On many a hard won field had stood,
Determined for their native land,
Freely to give their heart’s best blood.

3. ’Twas vain! for an unnumber’d host,
Clos’d round our small heroic band
The General saw that hope was lost,
And sadly gave up his command.

4. His desperate soldiers still fought on,
Determined they would yet be free,
Unconscious of what had been done,
By their loved leader General Lee.

5. Look! as a courier hurries on,
To still the cannon’s deafening roar,
He bids them lay their armor down,
And fight for homes and friends no more.

CHORUS 5
But the soldier would not listen to the story,
’Till their glorious old leader bid them yield,
They would follow him to sorrow or to glory
So all silently they left the battle field.
