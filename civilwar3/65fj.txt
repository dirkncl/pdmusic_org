FULL CHORUS [sung before each VERSE; 
and after last VERSE]
Hail, Freedomland! 
Hail, Freedomland!
Sing Jubilee! 
Shout Victory!

1. Nations, rejoice!
With glorious voice!
Our cannons roar,
“Slaves are no more!”

2. Our flag unfurl’d
O’er the New World;
Waves, without pall,
For humans thrall.

3. Glad Echo thrills,
Through native hills,
Where our loved Sires
Lit Freedom’s fires.

4. Trusting in God,
On bloodstained sod,
The Freeman’s son,
Freedom’s fight won.

5. Great God, in Thee!
God of the Free!
Trust we— freemen—
Ever! Amen!
