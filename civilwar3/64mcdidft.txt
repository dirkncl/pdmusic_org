1. My comrades dear, draw near to me, 
And take my parting last good bye. 
Thoult tell my sister, mother dear, 
How like a soldier I did die; 
I see her now, she’s waiting still; 
Yes, waiting for the news from me, 
Oh! tell her of my parting words, 
My Country dear, I die for thee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
My mother dear, I see thee now, 
Thou’rt waiting for the news from me, 
Oh! tell her of my parting words, 
My Country dear, I die for thee.

2. Oh, tell her that the first great charge,
In our thin ranks did havoc make,
But well you know we rallied then,
And what was lost, we did retake;
I saw my comrades falling fast,
Yes, many dying near to me,
And faintly did I hear them say
My Country dear, I die for thee.

3. Then I heard the cheer of triumph,
Over the hills so far and wide;
When a traitors shot did strike me,
And then I sank amid the tide,
But oh the joy! we won the day!
I saw some traitors die near me;
Yet none of them could proudly say,
My country dear, I die for thee.
