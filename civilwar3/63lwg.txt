1.
All things beauteous for his slumber!
  Lilies, lift your cups of love,
Brimm'd with morning's dewy nectar,
  For the tender guardian-dove!
Roses, here like benedictions
  In the breath of summer wave;
Symbol-rainbows, linger gently
  Over little Willie's grave!

2.
He was ever beauteous, gentle,
  In his ways and in his eyes,
Fill'd with a prophetic splendor
  Streaming in them from the skies;
But we did not note the warning--
  Saw not what the angels gave;
Therefore there is quenchless sorrow
  Over little Willie's grave!

3.
Shall _earth_ try to soothe that sorrow?
  For the reft ones words are vain;
Smiles awhile may wreathe the spirit,
  But the tear _will_ flow again;
Comfort only comes from _Heaven_;
  Still we hear the words He gave--
"Come unto me little children"--
  Over little Willie's grave!

4*
[* This verse may be omitted at the pleasure of the singer.]
Tender mother, glorious father,
  Keeping still our Nation true
On the Constitution's mountain,
  Hear the Nation weeps with you.
We have also lost our kindred,
  Yet the immortal amaranth wave,
Blest by His sweet consolation,
  Over little Willie's grave!
