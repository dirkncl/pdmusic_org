1. Hasten, brothers, to the battle,
  Loud the bugle sounds afar;
I am weary, wounded, dying,
  But I hear the call for war.
Hasten, brothers do not linger,
  Leave me here alone to die;
Forms seraphic hover near me,
  They will bear my soul on high.
    Forms seraphic hover near me,
    They will bear my soul on high.

CHORUS 1-3.
Oh! I see the shining angels,
In that far off world of light;
They are coming, quickly coming,
Comrades hasten to the fight!
  They are coming, quickly coming,
  Comrades hasten to the fight!


2. I am dying, surely dying,
  Do not drop the bitter tear;
I am bleeding for my country,
  For the cause I hold so dear!
How I love our starry banner!
  Comrades wave it o’er my head!
Let me see the spotless emblem
  Ere I’m numbered with the dead.
    Let me see the spotless emblem
   Ere I’m numbered with the dead.

3. Tell my mother— darling mother,
  That I love her fondly now,
That I longed for her caresses,
  Her sweet kisses on my brow!
Tell my father I have fallen,
  Yielded up my precious life,
Tell him not to mourn my absence
  Comrades, hasten to the strife.
    Tell him not to mourn my absence
    Comrades, hasten to the strife.

4. Hark! I hear the notes of angels,
  In that far off world of light,
Christ is calling— I must leave you,
  Darling brothers, nobly fight!
See! a shining angel’s coming
  To watch o’er my fleeting breath;
I am coming— gently coming,
  Comrades, ’tis heroic death!
    I am coming— gently coming,
    Comrades, ’tis heroic death!

CHORUS 4.
Gently life your fallen brother,
Soon I’ll see that world of light;
I am dying, nobly dying,
Comrades hasten to the fight!
  I am dying, nobly dying,
  Comrades hasten to the fight!
