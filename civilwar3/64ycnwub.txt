1.
You can never win us back never never!
Tho' we perish in the track of your endeavor
Tho' our cor[p]ses strew the earth that smiled upon our birth,
and blood polutes each hearth stone for ever.

2.
We have risen to a man, stern and fearless;
Of our curses and your ban we are careless;
Every hand is on its knife, every gun is primed for strife,
Every palm contains a life high and peerless.

3.
We may fall before the fire of your legions
Paid with gold's murderous hire--base allegiance;
But for every drop that's shed, we will have a mound of dead,
And vultures shall be fed in your regions.

4.
You have no such noble blood for the shedding;
In the veins of cavaliers was its heading;
You have no such stately men in your abolution den
To wade through fire and fen, nothing dreading.

5.
The battle to the strong is not given,
While the Judge of right and wrong sits in Heaven;
For the God of David still wields the pebble at His will--
There are giants yet to kill, wrongs unshriven.
