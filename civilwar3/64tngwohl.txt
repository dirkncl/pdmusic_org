1. Hark! hear ye not that solemn sound, 
That comes like the Ocean6s dying moon; 
’Tis the ling’ring strain that the angels play 
O’er the nameless graves where our heroes lay. 

REFRAIN (solo) and CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Rest, here’s rest! calmly repose, 
Safe from the reach of mortal woes; 
For we knew while we weep 
At this transient pain, 
That the loved ones part tomeet again.

2. Friends that we loved in life’s bright bloom, 
Have been born away to the warriors tomb; 
The silver card has been rent in twain, 
And the angels have gathered them home again.

3. Sad are our hearts for their light is fled,
And their treasures sleep with the nameless dead,
Her faith sleeps low on its noiseless wing,
And bids us hark! while the angels sing.

4. From the field of strife where the hero dies,
There’s a shining parhway that mounts the skies;
And the tongue that cheers our hosts along,
May swell the sweet stiring of the angels song.

5. Let us weep no more, for although we part,
There’s a ray of hope for the saddest heart;
’Tis the hope that when time and toil are o’er,
We shall meet where the loved ones part no more.
