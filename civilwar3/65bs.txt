1. When Johnny Sands his hands got loos’d, 
Folks thought he was insane, 
But ’twas his conscience that produced 
The water on the brain; 
No helpmate now his home to share, 
But thrown on his own hands, 
He all at once became aware 
How dear was Betty Sands! 
How dear was Betty Sands, 
How dear was Betty Sands. 
Now Betty as it did appear, 
Upon a bank soon stuck, 
Quoth she he call’d me oft his dear, 
But now I am his duck; 
Oh! wicked woman there I stood 
That cruel knot to tie, 
I thought a dip would do him good, 
But he left me to die, 
But he left me to die, 
But he left me to die.”

2. Then straightway to  her home she flew, 
Poor Johnny mad, almost, 
Exclaim’, “Oh! pray forgive me do!” 
He took her for a Ghost; 
No wonder, in a frightfulness, 
He knew not Misses Sands— 
Till, first of all she wrung her dress, 
And then  she wrung her hands, 
And then she wrung her hands, 
And then she wrung her hands. 
“Oh! Johnny! Johnny!” she exclaimed, 
”I’ve caught a fearful cold, 
But, now the past is all explain’d, 
I never more will scold; 
Since love has tied our hearts secure 
I’ll never tie your hands;” 
And this was the cold water cure 
Of John and Betty Sands, 
Of John and Betty Sands, 
Of John and Betty Sands.
