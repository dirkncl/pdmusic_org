1. They’re coming home! they’re coming home
From camp and battle field
Our boys are coming, with the flag
That they would never yield
To  traittor hands, and they have dared
To guard us from the foe.
They’re coming home! they’re coming home,
From us no more to go.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
They’re coming home, they’re coming home,
Our boys are coming home,
They come to cheer our weary hearts
Which longed for them to come.
They come to cheer our weary hearts
Which longed for them to come!

2. They’re coming home! they’re coming home!
Our boys are coming home
They come to cheer our weary hearts
Which longed for them to come.
The flag is over ev’ry state,
The Union now is ours,
And we must crown our soldier boys
With garlands of sweet flowers.

3. Our boys are coming home again,
They’re coming home to tell
Of deeds since country called to them
To bid their friends farewell.
They’re coming home! they’re coming home,
Our gallant volunteers.
God bless the hearts which bravely sought
To dry sweet Freedom’s tears.
