1. Almighty Father, Sov’reign Lord,
Before Thy throne we stand,
And now invoke with one accord,
A blessing on our land.
In Freedom’s cause our sires have bled,
And Freedom’s vict’ry won;
To glorious triumph they were led
By our great Washington.

2. ’Twas THOU who  served them for the fight,
For O, the cause was thine!
Thou art the source of all that’s right,
And Freedom is Divine.
It only could proceed from THEE,
The Great, the Good, the Wise,
Thou GOD, omnipotent and free,
WHO reign’st o’er earth and skies.

3. Since THOU to us this blessing lent,
Beneath it we have grown
In wealth, and power, and vast extent—
The Western World our own.
And nations wonder when they hear
How mighty we became;
But Lord, we give with heart sincere,
The Glory to THY NAME.

4. Yes ev’rywhere, on land and sea,
Our Banner is unfurled,
A glorious sign of Liberty,
To cheer a downtrod world.
Oh! may its Stars shine out before
The nations of the earth,
Directing millions to the shore
Reserved for Freedom’s birth.

5. In vain do wicked men unite
’Gainst Freedom’s heav’nborn laws;
The God of battles in His might
Shall still maintain His cause.
Our fathers in His name stood forth,
And we shall firmly stand;
Our Flag shall wave from South to North,
O’er a united land.

6. And ever down the ages hence,
Christ’s Banner shall with ours
Remain our ensign of defence,
Against all hostile powers.
The Bible shall be open kept,
That every one may read,
Till error from the land is swept,
And we are “free indeed.”
