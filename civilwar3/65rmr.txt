1. Tis finish’d! on Columbia’s head
  Doth gasping treason pour
Its seventh vial of fiendish wrath!
  Her father is no moor!
The foulest deeds of treason’s life
  Which fill’d the land with woe!
How vain beside its dying stroke,
  Which lays our chieftain low.

CHORUS 1-4.
Rest, martyr, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though murd’rous hands have still’d thy heart,
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martyr, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though murd’rous hands have still’d thy heart,
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martyr, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though murd’rous hands have still’d thy heart,
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martyr, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though murd’rous hands have still’d thy heart,
  Thy noble deeds remain. 

2. Four years as chieftain did he toil
  To free our own fair land,
And traitors all around him stood
  To grasp it from his hand;
And in our nation’s gladdest hour
  The assassin’s hand was near;
It struck our noble Lincoln down—
  Columbia’s hearts hold dear.

3. The nation’s heart o’erflow’d with joy
  To see the conflict cease,
And grim war’s bursting clouds revealed
  The angel form of peace,
The Union safe, the slave set free,
  By his kind heart and hand;
Oh! why must he, like Moses, die
  In view of Canaan’s land.

4. We should not question Providence
  Who wisely rules o’er all,
And in his tender love doth mark
  The only sparrow’s fall;
But tremble, traitors, least the wrath
  Your murd’rous act hath sown,
Leave Justice free from Mercy’s pray’rs,
  To deal with you alone.

5. Though tongues inspired would tell our woe,
  And tears in oceans roll,
Vain would they prove to paint the grief
  That wrings the nation’s soul.
We bow in silence to the storm
  By which the love divine,
Doth cleanse and cause Columbia’s stars
  With tenfold light to shine.

CHORUS 5.
Rest, martye, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though nation mourns the loss of thee—
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martye, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though nation mourns the loss of thee—
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martye, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though nation mourns the loss of thee—
  Thy noble deeds remain. Rest, martye, rest,
  From the scenes of death and pain,
Though nation mourns the loss of thee—
  Thy noble deeds remain.
