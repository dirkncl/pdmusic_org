1. Oh, talk not of daises and violets of spring. 
Of rosebuds and dewdrops or any such thing. 
For the loveliest flow’ret that grows in the dell, 
Is the dear bonnie maiden they call little Nell.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sweet little Nell you are dearer to me, 
Than dew is the rose, or the rose is the bee. 
Charming Nell, fairy Nell, happy smiling and true, 
Sweet flow’r of the hillside, I worship but you.

2. Her smile is as sweet, and her eyes are so bright, 
That she looks every star out of countenance quite, 
And the turn of her head sets my heart in a whirl, 
And I envy the breezes that play with each curl.

3. Better it would be if we never had met, 
For she never has told me she loves me as yet, 
And she smiles on the farmer that lives on the hill, 
And she smiles on the miller that works at the mill.

4. Then sweet little Nell oh take pity on me, 
All day I am watching and waiting for thee, 
While I frown on the farmer and man at the mill, 
You shall be my own true love and think of me still.
