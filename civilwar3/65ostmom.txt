1. Oh! speak to me once more,
And let thy blessing fall
Upon thy wife and child,
Who love thee more than all;—
Tell us we still are dear—
Oh! hear me, I implore,
Smile on us once again,—
Oh! speak to me once more!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Yet we shall meet again,—
Upon the golden shore,
And one, we love so well,
Shall speak to us once more!

2. Oh! speak to me once more,
Say but a single word,'
’Twill be the sweetest sound
That we have ever heard;—
’Twill be a sung of love,
No mortal heard before,
Oh! listen to my prayer,—
Oh! speak to me once more!

3. Oh! speak to me once more,—
Say, all my tears are vain,
The lips of one we love
With never speak again;—
Yet we shall meet again
Upon the golden shore,
And one, we love so well,
Shall speak to us once more!
