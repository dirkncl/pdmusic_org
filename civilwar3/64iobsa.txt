1. Is our Banner still advancing?
Hear the lloyal hosts exclaim,
While the rallying ranks of freemen
Onward dash and smoke and flame!
Onward up the fort ribbed mountain,
’Gainst the leaden hail they pressed,
’Till the grand old flag of Freedom
Waved in triumph o’er it’s crest!

CHORUS 1-3.
Still advancing,  Higher! Higher!
Shout ye Loyal! Shout ye Brave!
Tyrants! let your hopes expire,
When you see that Banner wave!

2. Is our Banner still advancing?
Gasped the soldier as he died;
While the blood his heart was yielding,
Trickled down the mountain side!
But his comrades hurried upward,
’Till the mountain top they trod,
They have scaled that dreaded mountain;
He has scaled the mount of God!

3. Is our Banner still advancing?
Rings the echo through the air;
Well may freemen swell the chorus,
All their hopes are centered there!
Bear aloft that grand old Banner,
While our rallying hosts repeat
This shall be our Nations glory,
Or our Nations winding sheet!
