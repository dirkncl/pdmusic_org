All round the country people responded to what was called "the
cotton famine" and raised money to help those affected.]

1. A thrilling sound of wail ing;
Comes from the Northern Land;
Where Labour's means are failing,
To serve the willing hand;
There stout hearts crouch in sadness,
And maidens sit and sigh,
No marvel if in madness,
They laid them down to die.

2. Oh! Let us haste in pity,
To help them in their woe;
From Hamlet, Vill and City,
Let rich compassion flow,
We but protect our Nation,
While we are shielding them;
The fruits of their salvation,
Shall deck Love's diadem.

3. Last Winter, clouds of sorrow,
Involv'd the Royal home,
And now the poor man's morrow,
Of pain and death hath come;
But whether high or humble,
We pass beneath the rod;
Victoria and her People,
Still put their trust in God.
