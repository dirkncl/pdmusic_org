1.
When the battle is o'er and the sounds of fight
Have died with the closing day,
How happy around tho' watchfire's light
To chat the long hours away;
To chat the long hours away, my boy,
And talk of the days to come,
Or a better still and purer joy,
To think of our far off home.

CHORUS (ad lib) [sung after each verse]
We'll chat the long hours away, my boy,
And talk of the days to come,
Or a better still, and a purer joy,
To think of our far off home.

2.
How many a cheek will then grow pale,
That never felt a tear,
And many a stalwart heart will quail,
That never quail'd in fear;
And a breast that like some mighty rock
Amid the foaming sea,
Bore high against the battle shock,
Now heaves like infancy.

3.
And those who know each other not
Their hands together steal,
Each thinks of some long hallow'd spot,
And all the brothers feel;
Such holy thoughts to all are giv'n,
The lowliest has his parts,
The love of home like love of heav'n
Is woven in our hearts.
