1. Oh I’m sassy Sam, a Southern nig’ as you can plainly see
I was born in the Sugarcanes, some miles from Point Conpee
My master used to wallup me, so I cut my sticks and ran
And the soldiers they got hold of me and made me contraband.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh if you listen white folks
I’ll please you if I can
For I am a bully nigger
And my name is sassy Sam.

2. I then put on a uniform and drilled at all occasions
And called myself a Corps d’Afrique and learned to cook my rations.
But soon I found it would not pay the greenbacks were not plenty
So down I went to New Orleans to deal in Cakes and Candy.

3. But soon I burst, and gave up shop and changed my advocation
And then bought out a shoeblack stand in a very fine location
Now Gents if’you need some blacking done, just come right to my stand
Three doors from the Saint Charles Hotel you’ll find me Sassy Sam.
