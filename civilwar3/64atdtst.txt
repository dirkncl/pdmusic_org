1. “Morituri te Salutant”
  Say the soldiers as they pass;
Not in uttered words they say it,
  But we feel it as they pass;
“We that are about to perish,
  We salute you as we pass!”
Gallant chiefs their swords presenting,
  Drop the points as on they pass.

2. Battle banners, torn and glorious,
  Dip saluting as they pass;
Brazen clangors shake the welkin
  As the marching columns pass;
Naught of golden pomp or glitter,
  Mark the Veterans as they pass;
Travel stained but bronzed and sinewey,
  Firmly, proudly on they pass.

3. “Morituri te Salutant”
  And we hear them as they pass
On his pawning steed the General
  Scans the waves of men that pass;
And his eyes at times are misty,
  Then are blazing as they pass;
And his breast with pride is heaving
  As the stalwart veterans pass.

4. Oh our comrades gone before us
  In the last review to pass,
Never more to earthly chieftan
  Dipping colors as ye pass.—
Heaven accord ye gentle judgement
  When before its throne ye pass,
“Morituri te Salutant”
  Angels whisper as ye pass.

5. To the souls of all our pershed
  We, who still saluting pass,
Dip the flag and trail the sabre
  As with wasted ranks we pass;
And we murmur “Morituri
  Vos Salutant” as we pass,
And we murmur “Morituri
  Vos Salutant” as we pass.
