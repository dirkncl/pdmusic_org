1. Good night comrades! beauty’s smile,
Sweet reward is for our toil;
Toil that trains us for the field
To conquer, die but ne’er to yield,
Country, home and liberty!
This our rally cry shall be;
Our trust is Heav’n defends the right;
Good night, comrades all, good night!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Home dear home and liberty!
This our rally cry shall be,
Our trust, Heav’n defends the right;
Good night Comrades all, good night.

2. Good night comrades! all, good night!
Drill is o’er and hearts are light;
Firm and true we e’er will be,
To country, home and liberty,
Home, dear home, how sweet the sound!
There life’s truest joys are found,
Homeward haste we with delight;
Good night, comrades all, good night!
