1. Our poor little Harry, is laid down to rest,
  In the shade of the green willow tree,
Where oft in the summer he loved well to roam
  With his playmates so merry and free.
He fell ’neath the banner he cherished so dear
  As to follow it far to the fray,
Where loud boomed the cannon ’mid shouts of brave men,
  And the sabres in true hands did play.

CHORUS 1-4.
Sleep on, sleep on,
  Soft be your rest,
Our pride and our joy,
  Peaceful and sweet;
Sleep on, Little Harry the drummer boy,
  Sleep on,
  Sleep on.

2. ‘Tis one month tomorrow, since Harry came home,
  And his dear form we first did espy,
Enwrapped in the banner of red, white and blue,
  With his drum sitting silently by.
His hands on his bosom were tenderly clasped,
  He had beat his last reveille call,
’Twas “down with the traitor and up with the star,”
  He was beating when fell’d by a ball.

3. He cried, “dearest mother, I’ll see thee no more,
  Nor the home I so fondly have lov’d;
Nor ne’er the green willow I planted myself,
  And beneath which I so oft have roved,
O bury me, mother, beneath that same tree,
  With the flag of the free for my shroud,
And please to remember, and pillow my head,
  With my drum of which I am so proud.”

4. And kindly ’twas granted, for where he was brought,
  Neath the willow he softly was laid,
The flag of our union around his was wrapped,
  And the drum, it was played as he said.
And now robinredbreast comes early at morn
  And so dearly it chirps o’er his tomb,
It seems to say, “Harry,” in ev’ry sweet note,
  That it sings in that green willow dome.
