  This song is founded upon a fact, and witnessed by the 
author, on board the steamer Commodore July 15, 1862, while
lying off Fortress Monroe; subject taken from a dying Soldier 
Boy's last words. "If I sleep Will Mother Come?"
  The subject this song is taken from, was a Drummer in the 
First Minnesota Reg. of only 11 years of age; he had a great de-
sire to the last to see his Mother, and it was only by the 
assurance of the nurse that, if he would go to sleep his mother 
would come and kiss him when he was asleep; this seem'd to have 
the desired effect, and he tried to sleep; the nurse left him 
but in ten minutes, returned and found him dead. His mother had 
been sent for three days before his death, but owing to some 
delay she did not get there until after he died.


1. Will they let her come to see me,
And speak a word of cheer,
They will not keep her from me,
My own loved mother dear;
O they surely will not keep her
From this one earthly joy,
No they surely can’t refuse her,
When she comes to see her boy.

CHORUS 1-4.
Come mother see thy poor sick child,
Ere he resign his breath;
His heart so pure, his face so mild,
Will soon be cloth’d in death.

2. Pray be calm, be patient darling,
Your mother’ll soon be here;
Cleer up and cease thy moaning,
Now cast aside all fear,
Angels boy will hover o’er thee,
Now you must cease to weep;
They will lead thy mother to thee,
She will kiss thee in thy sleep.


3. See an angel stands before me,
And beckons me to come;
O, lady tell me don’t decieve me,
“If I sleep, will mother come,”
’Tis thy mother watching o’er thee,
Her spirit it is here;
This God’s message sent unto thee,
Rest assured she’ll soon be here.

4. His mother came, but truly sad
The countenance she wore,
The spirit of her boy had fled
But one short hour before.
Yes her darling’s days were ended,
His sufferings were o’er,
Gone by angel bands attended,
To that Holy Heavenly shore.
