1. Hail northern men who love their land!
  Gird on your armor bright!
Go ye forth a gallant band,
  And battle for the right!
Raise your battle flag on high,
  God save our noble land,
God save our noble land!
  For her we live, for her we’ll die,
Like Sparta’s noble band!

CHORUS 1-6.
For her we live, for her we’ll die,
Like Sparta’s noble band!

2. Go ye forth with valiant arm,
  To save your happy home,
Fear ye not the bold alarm,
  Which rings from tower to dome;
Their forts, their arms, we mean to take,
  With all the rebel host,
With all the rebel host,
  And make the earth about them shake,
With thunder from our coast.

3. Dispute with them each inch of ground,
  Within our noble land,
Let your martial music sound,
  Along the southern strand;
“Strike till the last armed foe expires,”
  On each green vale and hill,
On each green vale and hill,
  “Strike for your altars and your sires,”
God shields our country still.

4. Drive from our land this cruel foe,
  That dares our flag defy,
That aims at us a dastard blow,
  And bids us yield or die.
Yield! yes with the crimson flood
  That ebbs our lives away,
That ebbs our lives away,
  For our injured country’s good
We’ll yields the lifeless clay!

5. Ne’er shall the rebel colors wave,
  In scorn on equal rights,
In the land our fathers died to save,
  From England’s belted Knights;
The Union flag shall wave above
  Our land united free,
Our land united free,
  And peace like a descending dove
Shall come with victory.

6. Then Union men that love your land
  Gird on your armor bright!
And go forth a gallant band
  To battle for the right!
Raise your banner shout your cry,
  God save our noble band,
God save our noble band,
  For her we live, for her we’ll die
Like Sparta’s noble band!
