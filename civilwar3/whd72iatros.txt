1.
I saw the brow of nature
Adorned with beauty fair,
I saw the brow of nature
Adorned with beauty fair,
The breath of summer roses
Perfumed the summer air,
Bright golden beams were playing
With every pearly rill.
And songs of joy were wafted
Along the vine land hill.

QUARTETTE or CHORUS
There comes (a low soft murmur,),
With every passing breaze.
"I am the Rose of Sharon
The Lily of the Vale."

2.
So when at peace with Jesus
We lift our thoughts above,
So when at peace with Jesus
We lift our thought above,
Reposing in his mercy
Our undivided love,
As nature smiles in beauty
When storms and clouds depart.
'Tis sunshine all around us,
'Tis summer in the heart.

(QUARTETTE or CHORUS)

3.
O then by faith directed
What heavenly scenes of view,
O then by faith directed
What heavenly scenes of view
Our souls are lost in wonder
Our songs are ever new,
Celestial rays descending
Their genial light impart.
With light our hope of glory,
'Tis summer in the heart.

(QUARTETTE or CHORUS)
