1. Toll the bell mournfully, toll the bell slow,
Toll the bell solemnly, toll  the bell low;
The Chief of the land is taken away,
The Nation in grief is mourning today.
Mantle his form with the Flag of the land,
The symbol of peace then place in his hand.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Toll the bell mournfully, toll the bell slow,
Toll the bell solemnly, toll the bell low,
The Chief of the land is taken away,
The Nation in grief is mourning today.

2. Toll the bell mournfully, toll the bell slow,
Toll the bell solemnly, toll  the bell low;
The Chief of the land is taken away,
The Nation in grief is mourning today.
Place on his breast a wreath of sweet flowers,
Gather’d with care fresh from the bowers.

3. Toll the bell mournfully, toll the bell slow,
Toll the bell solemnly, toll  the bell low;
The Chief of the land is taken away,
The Nation in grief is mourning today.
Take him with care away to his rest,
Where aught shall disturb the peace of his breast.

4. Toll the bell mournfully, toll the bell slow,
Toll the bell solemnly, toll  the bell low;
The Chief of the land is taken away,
The Nation in grief is mourning today.
High on his tomb the Banner unfold,
Sculpture his name in letters of gold.
