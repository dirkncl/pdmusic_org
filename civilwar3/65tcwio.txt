1. The cruel war is over,
And peace has come again,
The traitor has been vanquished
On evry battle plain;
The old flag now is floating,
Where oft it waved of yore,
And over all our Union
’Twill float forevermore!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The cruel war is over,
And peace has come again,
Our noble boys have won it
On ev’ry battle plain.

2. The army and the navy,
On land and on the sea,
Have made our flag triumphant,
The emblem of the free;
Our soldiers and our sailors
Have saved our mighty land
To be the home of millions
A free and happy hand.

3. The cruel war is over,
We read it in the skies,
The sunlight seems to tell us
That now oppression dies;
We welcome peace and freedom
From mountain to the shore,
And may our dear old banner
Float o’er us evermore.
