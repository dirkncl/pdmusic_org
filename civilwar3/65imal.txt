CHORUS.
Columbia weeps! 
Columbia weeps!
Her cherished son,
Who striuck her fetters to the ground,
Who saved the land of Washington,
Has passed from earth’s most distant bound;
Has passed from earth’s most distant bound;

SOPRANO SOLO.
His spirit went to realms on high,
His dust, alone, the earth could claim,
His memory will never die
While freemen live to bless his name,
His memoey will never die
While freemen live to bless his name.

SOLO QUARTET.
Columbia swears, anew, her vow
To guard the birthright of the free;
Unsheathed her sword of Justice, now
Since Mercy, since Mercy, since Mercy fell by Tyranny.

SOLO [with] CHORUS.
Our nation’s hopes and fears alike
Are with the land our fathers trod,
And while for Freedom, now, we strike,
Our future is alone with God!
And while for Freedom, now, we strike,
Our future is alone with God! alone with God!
