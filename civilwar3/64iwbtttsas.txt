[CHORUS 1A]
How can I leave thee still loving thee ever,
Leave thee my darling in sorrow and tears,
Fondly I promised to part with thee never
Living and loving, thro’ months and long years.

DUET or SOLO 1.
But over mountain and hillltop and valley,
Brave men are rushing, their country to save;

[CHORUS 1B]
Kinder the star spangled banner they rally,
Bound to defend it tho’ doom’d to the grave.
Under the star spangled banner they rally,
Bound to defend it the’ doom’d to the grave.

[CHORUS 2A]
Thus can I leave thee tho’ loving thee ever,
Here in my heart they sweet image shall live,
And tho’ we part and it may be forever,
I will be true love, this promise I give.

DUET or SOLO 2.
Duty may call me from home and from pleasure,
And I may never rerurn from the wars;

[CHORUS 2B]
But while I’m true to my heart’s dearest treasure,
I will be true to the stripes and the stars.
But while I’m true to me heart’s dearest treasure,
I will be true to the stripes and the stars.
