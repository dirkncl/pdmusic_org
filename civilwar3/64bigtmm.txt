1. Bear it gently to my mother,
Tell her that it came from me,
’Tis the little lock she cherished,
And I trust it now with thee;
Bear it to her, comrade, kindly,
For an angel soon I’ll be.
You shall share my latest blessing.
You were always kind to me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Bear it gently to my mother,
’Tis the boon I crave of thee,
(The boon I crave of thee,)
You shall share my latest blessing,
You were always kind to me.

2. If you see the maid I cherish,
Tell her that I fought and fell,
That my love shall never perish,
Though I now must say farewell;
Tell her we shall meet in heaven,
Where there is no care of pain.
Though on earth our hearts must sever,
We shall meet, yes, meet again.

3. Bear this gently to my mother,
Kiss her dear old wrinkled brow;
Kiss my sister and my brother,
Say, he is an angel now;
Kiss the little maid I cherish,
Dry her tears and smooth her hair.
Tell her soon to come and meet me,
In yon starry heavens there.
