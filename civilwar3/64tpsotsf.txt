1. I parted with my Mary,
One lovely morn in June;
The flowers were blooming brightly,
The birds sang sweet in tune.
’Twas at the gate I left her,
She sobbing sighed, farewell!
I heard the loud drums beating.
I heard the trumpets swell.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Farewell the drums are beating,
I hear the trumpets’ swell,
Huzza, there’s no retreating.
Dear Mary fare thee well.

2. In battles wild confusion,
’Mid sabre flash and ball;
We charge the hostile legions,
By drum and bugle call.
Our banners now are sweeping,
Across the ensanguined plain;
Their stars undimmed and shining,
Forever shall remain.

3. Soon cheerily returning,
From battles wild  alarms;
We’ll fear no deadly conflict,
No call to arms! to arms!
Throw out your starry banners,
Then ring the merry bells;
Our partings will be over.
We’ll breathe no more farewells.
