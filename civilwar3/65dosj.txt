[Preamble]
Columbia’s sons will mourn 
A hero dead and gone;
Who was his Soldier’s pride,
And for his country died.

1. On a bright May mourn in ’Sixty three,
And eager for the action,
On a battle field for Liberty,
Stood gallant Stonewall Jackson.
Both flesh and blood alike the same,
They strove to gain each other’s fame,
And long may hist’ry pen the name
Of gallant Stonewall Jackson

[Refrain sung after VERSEs 1 and 2]
Who was his soldier’s pride 
And for his country died.
On a bright May day in ’Sixty three
And ready for the action,
On a battle field for Liberty,
Stood gallant Stonewall Jackson.

2. A man more kind was never born,
In battle no one bolder;
His loss all noble hearts will mourn,
This gallant faithful Soldier.
For when the word was duty,
He was first to fight for victory,
Oh! may he live in history
The gallant Stonewall Jackson
Who

3. But alas his time was come
To see our promis’d Land;
His comrade’s fatal gun
Shot thru’ his arm and hand;
Th’Almighty’s will was read,
Upon his noble brow,
“My race is run,” he said,
Death has its victim now.
He was his soldier’s pride
And for his country died.
On a bright Mayday in ’Sixty three,
And ready for the action
On a battle field for Liberty,
Stood gallant Stonewall Jackson.
