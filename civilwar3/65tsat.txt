1. The Yankee boys have caught him—
The traitor, Old Jeff D!—
I wonder if they’ll hang him
To the “Sour Apple Tree!”
Don’t you think it will be right!
And justice, I declare!
To hang him up “to dry,” my boys,
And dangle in the air!

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
The Yankee boys have caught him—
The traitor, old Jeff D!—
I wonder if they’ll hang him
On the “Sour Apple Tree!”

2. O, when our Soldiers found him, 
I’ll bet he did “look rich”
With the “peticoats” around him
As he stood in the “last ditch!”
Old Jeff, he wasn’t wise
With boots on! don’t you see!
It was a splendid sight I’m sure,
Such “Southern chivalry!”

3. Now if they hang him, it will be
A moral lesson taught
To those who might in future time
Like him be evil fraught.
Some think it will be right—
Whatever it may be,
I realy think they’ll bang him
To the “Sour Apple Tree!”
