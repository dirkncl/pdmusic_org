1. Not in the battle’s strife he fell,
Nor ling’ring couch of pain,
But by an impious fiend of hell,
Shot! madly thro’ the brain.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Mourne ye afflicted people mourne,
Your shouts of joy give o’er
Sad news on passing breeze is borne,
Your Chieftan is no more.

2. Well may your sorrows brethren flow,
Your tears your cheeks bedew,
For shared he not your ev’ry woe,
And died he not for you.

3. And you ye noble patriot band,
Who stem’d rebellions tide,
’Till shouts of vict’ry fill'd the land
Weep ye! your friend is dead.

4. But not in vain shall tears be shed,
Upon the Patriots grave,
Like HIM of old, he died and bled,
A nation’s life to save.
