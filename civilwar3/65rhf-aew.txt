1. Richmond now has fallen
Hark! we hear the gun,
And the joyous echoes
Sounding loud and clear,
Give us proof of vict’ry
Now so bravely won
By those gallant heroes
Ever to us dear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
So let us shout,
One gladsome shouy,
For our brave boys on land and sea,
  One land and sea,
For now the stars and not the bars,
Will ever wave where all are free.
Hurrah!

2. Onward ever onward,
Still those brave men tramp
They are nobly fighting
For our land to save,
Soon our starry banner
They’ll in triumph plant,
Where there’s only freemen,
For there’ll be no slave.

3. Strike then for the Union,
Tide of good news swell,
Vict’ry crown our banner,
Which well ever wave
Proudly over heroes,
Where they nobly fell
Fighting for that banner,
And our land to save.
