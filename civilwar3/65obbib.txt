1. Wild blows the storm tonight, mother dear,
  Madly the waves dash the shore,
And  sighing thro the Elms with its music drear,
  The winds beat so sadly at our door;
Oh! mother, only think of the brave boys tonight,
  Our heroes valiant and true,
Who battle for the right in their strength and might,
  Let us pray for the brave boys in blue.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Our brave boys in blue,
  Our brave boys in blue,
Our heroes valiant and true;
  Oh! yes we’ll ever pray
We’ll pray for them all,
  Our bonnie boys in blue.

2. Far from their homes tonight, mother dear,
  Many a brave boy is sad,
Within the prison cell lonely sad and drear,
  With no one to cheer or make them glad;
But mother we can pray for the brave boys tonight,
  Our heroes noble and true,
That morning noon, and night, God will hear their cries,
  And will save the brave boys in blue.

3. Oh! holy One to whom all should bow
  Hear us this night in our plea!
Send sunshine to the heart of our noble boys,
  And shield them by land or on the sea;
And Father Holy One when this cruel war is o’er
  And freedom rings out anew,
When mountain, hill and crag echo back the song,
  Welcome home our brave boys in blue.
