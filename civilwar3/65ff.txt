1. The flowers I saw in the wildwood,
  Have since drop’d their beautiful leaves,
And the many dear friends of my childhood,
  Have sumber’d for years in their graves.
But the blooming of the flowers I remember,
  Tho’ their smiles I may never more see,
For the cold chilly winds of December,
  Stole my flow’rs, my companions, from me—
    For the cold chilly winds of December,
    Stole my flow’rs, my companions, from me

2. The roses may bloom on the morrow,
  And many dear friends I have won.
But my heart can part with but sorrow,
  When I think of the ones that are gone.
’Tis no wonder that I am broken hearted,
  And stricken with sorrow should be;
For we’ve met, we have loved, we have parted,
  My flow’rs, my companions, and me—
    For we’ve met, we have loved, we have parted,
    My flow’rs, my companions, and me

3. How dark looks the world and how dreary,
  When we part from the ones that we love;
But there’s rest for the faint and the weary,
  When friends meet with lost ones above.
For in heaven I can remember,
  When from earth my pround soul shall be free,
That no chilly winds of December,
  Shall steal my companions from me.
    That no chilly winds of December,
    Shall steal my companions from me.
