1. Oh the Politician crew, they don’t know wat to do
Since freedom in the South is plainly dawning,
They fear that this short night, of a little blood and fight,
Will bring us all out right in the morning.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then let us work away, and care not what they say,
For freedom in the South is plainly dawning;
With Abraham the Great, and Gen’ral Grant his mate,
They’ll bring us all out right in the morning.

2. I think Uncle Abe’s the man who another term can stand,
The Rebs and Copperheads with their scorning,
And eighteen sixty five we’ll elect him if alive,
For he’ll bring us all out right in the morning.

3. The Rebs call Uncle Abe an abolition Babe,
But I think they had better heed his warning,
For he had got more land than any other man,
And he’ll have all their niggers in the morning.

4. What a pity people can’t let alone our General Grant,
While he gathers all the Rebels ’neath his awning,
He’ll give old Jeff the chance to have a “swinging dance,”
And we’ll all “see him home” in the morning.
