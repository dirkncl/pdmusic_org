1. Sister, I am sad and weary, 
Tired of war’s long list of slain, 
Yet you always say, be cheery, 
Peace will soon return again. 
Brother fell at Lookout Valley, 
Like a hero in the fray, 
Never more can trumtet rally, 
Willie from his bed of clay!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
All the land is full of mourning, 
Weeping for the loved ones slain, 
But a brighter day is dawning, 
Peace will soon return again!

2. Still our contry calls her legions 
Forward to some Waterloo, 
And with in those rebel regions, 
Eddie soon may perish too. 
Vacant chairs to every dwelling, 
Utter tales of bygone hours, 
Whilst with grief fond hearts are telling, 
Of their kindred ’neath the flowers.

3. Look aloft! the sun is shining,
Ne’er let grief your heart enthrall;
Darkest clouds have silver lining
And above there’s peace for all!
Sister I could dance so featly,
For the tidings from afar;
Like an angel singing sweetly,
Soon will end this ruthless war.

4. Prayers ascend from every valley
From the prairie and the plain;
Heav’n be our country’s ally,
Grant us smiling peace again!
Spare, O spare our darling brothers,
Make our righteous cause thy own,
Dry the tears of Sisters, Mothers,
Bless the land of Washington.
