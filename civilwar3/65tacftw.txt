1. They are coming from the wars,
They are bringing home their scars,
They are bringing back the old flag too, in glory;
They have battled long and well,
And let after ages tell,
How they won the proudest name in song or story!
They gave broken up their camps;
They are laughing o’er their tramps;
They are joking with the girls who flock around them;
They have left the scanty fare,
They have left the fetid air,
They have dash’d to earth the prison wall that bound them. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
They are coming from the wars,
They are bringing back the old flag too, in glory;
They are bringing home their scars.
They have won the proudest name in song or story.

2. We are eager with our thanks.
We are pressing on their ranks.
We are grasping hands that held the stars unbroken,
Yet we sadly think of those
Who are sleeping with their foes.
And our trembling tongues give welcome sadly spoken,
But the long delay is past.
They have brought us peace at last.
And how proudly through our veins the blood is bounding,
As we bless our honored dead,
While the steady martial tread,
Of returning Vet’rans in our ears is sounding.
