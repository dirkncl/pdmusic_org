1. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
Say dont  you think we are putting it through
We’ll take Fort Sumpter and Char leston too
And then Dear Jeff we are coming to you!
And then Dear Jeff we are coming to you!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O Jefferson Davis! Jefferson Davis!
Jefferson Davis, how do you do?

2. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
Say how shall you feel when you are  put through
There’s pardon for great ones and little ones too
But Jeff, we have got a good halter for you!
But Jeff, we have got a good halter for you!

3. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
Now dont run away when we’re puttin you through
But let us take Richmond and Jefferson too
We’re coming on purpose Dear Jeff to see you!
We’er coming on purpose Dear Jeff to see you!

4. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
Bring your head to this halter, be putting it through
You’ve done it to others, a good many too,
And now poor Jeff it is coming to you!
And now poor Jeff it is coming to you.

5. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
The halter looks good now you’ve got your head through!
Now give a gook kick, and a hasty one too,
And Jefferson Davis there’s no more of you!
And Jefferson Davis there’s no more of you. 

6. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
I hope that Old Nick aint a putting you through
He ought to be gentle and merciful too,
On earth no poor devil obeyed him like you.
On earth no poor devil obeyed him like you.

7. O Jefferson Davis, how do you do?
Rebellion all ended, the rebels put through
The country all saved, and the Union too,
But give us an answer, Dear Jeff where are you?
But give us an answer, Dear Jeff where are you?
