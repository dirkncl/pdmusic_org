1. I’ve no mother now, I’m weeping.
She has left me here alone;
She beneath the sod is sleeping,
Now there is no joy at home.
Tears of sorrow long have started,
He bright smile no more I’ll see;
All the lov’d ones too have parted,
Where, oh where is joy for me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Weeping lonely she has left me here,
Weeping lonely for my mother dear.

2. Oh! how well do I remember,
“Take this little flow’r” said she;
And when with the dead I’m number’d,
Place it at my grave for me.
Dearest Mother, I am sighing,
On thy tomb I drop a tear;
For the little plant is dying,
Now I feel so lonely here.

3. I’ve no mother, still I’m weeping,
Tears my furrow’d cheek now lave;
Whilst a lonely watch I’m keeping,
O’er her sad and silent grave.
Soon I hope will be our meeting,
Then the gladness none can tell;
Who for me will then be weeping,
When I bid this world farewell.
