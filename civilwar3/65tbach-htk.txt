1. The bells are ringing swet and clear,
The drums are beating loud;
The air is rent with shout and cheer,
As onward moves the crowd,
The flags are out, the day is fine,
The sun is shining bright
Upon the slowly moving line,
A brave and gallant sight. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
The war is done our loved ones come
No longer hence to roam,
Our hearts are gay with joy today,
The boys are coming home,
Hurrah, hurrah,
The boys are coming home.

2. With banners torn by shot and shell,
And garments rent and worn,
It takes not long the tale to tell
Of dangers nobly borne;
Of fearful strife the land to save,
And how the foe went down!
Let beauty’s smile reward the brave
And love his life shall crown.

3. Aye, beat your drums and raise your shout,
And let us all be gay,
The rebels now are put to rout,
And treason had its day.
Oh! ring ye bells! and shout for joy,
My patient, waiting heart!
From my own gallant soldier boy
I never more shall part.
