Three Offerings to Thee,
Goddess of Liberty

  To thee fair Goddess our offerings we bring.
Accept them though humble they be.
  For gladly we trust to thy keeping the flag,
That waves o'er the brave and the free.

1. Once more noble Chieftain we hail thee so true,
  Our nation’s great hope and her pride,
You have gallantly stood by the Red, White and Blue,
  And you check’d the rebellious mad tide.
Come up to the work boys, stand firm at the wheel,
  We’ll vote for our nation’s bright star,
While our soldiers fight traitors abroad with their steel,
  We will crush them at home ’neath our car.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then rally again from the prairie and wood,
  We will fight for the land we love best,
We will stand by our Chieftain so great and so good,
  Gallant Abe! Honest Abe of the West.

2. Yes hail! noble Chieftain in honor we hail!
  Now boys we will try him again;
He is driving the Wedge in the Tyrant’s great Rail,
  And he’ll soon split Rebellion in twain.
Then fall into line boys our nation doth call,
  And Traitors at home shall soon feel
That our Chieftain shall triumph, the Dragon shall fall,
  And his head shall be crushed ’neath your heel.

3. Come up to the polls then from mountain and glen,
  Stand firm boys and work for the right,
We will show the bold Traitors we’ll triumph again,
  When we face him once more in fight;
Now forward brave boys and press hard the great Tower,
  And the foeman within shall soon see
That his dart cannot harm us, we hail the glad hour
  When the nation forever is free.
