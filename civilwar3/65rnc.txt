1. Rest, noble Chieftain, sweet by thy sleep
And over thy grave a Nation shall weep;
Thy voice may be mute and palsied thy hand,
But thy spirit still lives in the heart of the land.
The fair tree of Freedom shall flourish and bloom
When long thou hast slept enshrin’d in the tomb,
And the  songs of the free shall brighten the name
When monarchs are dead and perish’d their fame.
When monarchs are dead and perish’d their fame.

2. Rest noble Chieftain, mighty and brave!
Peaceful thy sleep and hallow’d thy grave;
No sound shall disturb thy quiet repose,
While o’er thee shall grow the myrtle and rose.
Thy mission was ended;
Heav’n call’d thee away
When over the land peace shed its sweet ray;
May joy e’er be thine in glory above,
Where naught reigns but freedom, mercy and love,
Where naught reigns but freedom, mercy and love.
