1.
The Star-spangled Cross and the pure field of white
  Is the banner we give to the breeze:
'Tis an emblem of Freedom unfurled in the right,
  O'er our homes and our lands and our seas.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We'll stand by the Cross and the pure field of white,
  While a shred's left to float in the air:
Our trust is in God, who can  help us in fight,
  And defend those who ask Him in prayer.

2. For years have we cringed to the unlifted rod,
  For years have demanded our right;
Our voice shouts defiance--our trust is in God,
  And the strong arm that gives us our might.

3. Our hills and our vales with the death-shriek may ring,
  And our forests may swarm with the foe:
But still to the breeze our proud banner we'll fling,
  And to Victory or Death we will go.
