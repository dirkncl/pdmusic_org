1. I have studied both Johnson and Walker,
And defin'd Noah Webster's whole talker,
But ne'er found so puzzling a talker,
As the short monosyllable Fix
When my friend's are all _fix'd_ in their places,
With smiles brightly _fix'd_ in their faces,
I'll sing then a few of the phrases,
Of this rare monosyllable _Fix_ 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
fix fix monosyllable fix 
fix fix monosyllable _fix_.

2. While trav'ling one day in a steamer
Of happiness more than a dreamer
As lively and gay as schemer
I forgot the sad syllable _Fix_
When lo with a rattle like thunder
Our vessel was broken asunder
I heard and with infinite wonder
A poor fellow exclaim, we are _Fix'd_!

3. The rogue who some landlord has cheated
And the plans of the bailie defeated
Exclaims as he's cosily seated
How sang the old fellow I _fix'd_
In fancied security napping
He fears not the dangers of trapping
Till some one his shoulder is tapping
Saying, "Come my dear fellow, you're _Fix'd_."

4. He perchance who has married his darling
Finds his joys turn'd to wrangling and snarling
Like Sterne's poor unfortunate starling
Is caged and for life surely _Fix'd_
If a shrew no treatment can cure her
No being with comfort endure her
No power to silence ensure her
Till in death she's eternally _Fix'd_

5. If fortune blind goddess opposes
At my song you all turn up you noses
I shall blush like a basket of roses
And feel very mournfully _Fix'd_
But should my kind good natur'd hearers
Most happily prove to be cheerers
My heart and my eyes will be tearers
For joy I'm so blissfully _Fix'd_.
