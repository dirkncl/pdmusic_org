1. O dear, O dear, I shall go mad,
My husband is so crazy,
O dear, O dear, I am so sad
Sure I shall soon grow mazy
He's right before his wooden clock,
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

2. O dear, O dear, what shall I do,
He surely does amaze me.
He does not know his daughter Sue--
His eyes are glaring glazy.
He's right before his wooden clock
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And brawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

3. The bar-man came, O Mister B--
You are wanted down below,
A German wishes you to see,
That long score to pay, you know.
But still he sat before his clock,
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

4. His wife for skilful doctors sent,
Sagarious airs, said she.
Say whats amiss, he's madly bent--
Therefore he must shaved be
O dear, O dear, before his clock--
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

5. The barber came, and bow'd polite,
Sares, vat you mean, I now do.
Go shave that madman's head outright,
Bawling like a time piece true,
He'd right before his wooden clock,
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

6. His wife was drowned deep in tears,
Lord, my husband, what a stare,
Quick Monsieur V, and take your shears,
Go and cut off all of his hair.
He's right before the wooden clock,
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

7. Vat he, before the clock, ah no,
Vat he, I see before me.
O strap him down, or I no go
He will murder me you see,
He's right before his wooden clock,
With his forefinger going,
And there he sits, the clock, to mock,
And bawls like madness growing.
Here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

8. The landlord still went on outright,
His eyes did fiery shine.
He ne'er relax'd his utmost might,
Till he heard his clock strike nine.
Down went his chair upstarted he.
I have won. I've won the chink.
And hour is gone, the bet you see,
Fifty my boys, nor e'er think,
That in a bet, I'd master'd be,
With here she goes, and there she goes.

9. Where are the men say where my dear,--
That laid the wager with me,--
What those gents, they're gone an hour clear
Then they have robbed me, you see--
And book with hundred, seven dear--
When they said plank up, I threw,
O foolish man outwitted clear,
By strangers you never knew,
With here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.

10. The doctors laugh'd, enjoy'd the joke,
The neighbors around the same,
For he was chous'd by a master stroke,
By rare wily wags of fame,
Both boys, and men his nerves now shock,
And keep the story going.
Why what a fool to mock the clock,
As plainly he was shewing,
With here she goes, and here she goes,
And there she goes.
