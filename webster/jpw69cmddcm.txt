1. 
Call me darling, darling, call me, 
  Speak it tender, ly  once more, 
As you used to when we parted 
  Nightly at my father’s door; 
Then your arms entwined  me fondly, 
  And your cheek was laid on mine; 
Oh,  my darling, call me darling, 
  Gently, as in dear ‘lang syne.’

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Through long years of silent sorrow, 
  I have loved the pet name so,
Oh, my darling, call me darling, 
  Speak it gently ere I go.

2. 
Call me darling, darling, call me, 
  Though thy love be dead and cold, 
I would hear  the fond, fond pet name, 
  Softly spoken as  of old. 
Heed my pleadings, now, oh heed them, 
  While my eyes are free from tears; 
Oh, my darling, call me darling, 
  Kindly, as in other years. 

3. 
Call me darling, darling, call me, 
  It will, love, blest hours recall— 
Tho’ for years you have not loved me, 
  I’ve been faithful thro’ them all, 
For the sake of children buried, 
  Lit tle childred, one, two, three— 
Oh, my darling, call me darling, 
  In  the accents dear to me. 

4. 
Call me darling, darling, call me,
  It will soothe the fever flame.
Could I hear thy accents lowly,
  Syllable the old pet name;
Years ago my roses faded,
  White hairs gleam the dark among,
But my darling, call me darling,
  Though I am no longer young.

5. 
Call me darling, darling, call me,
  Though tonight I’m fever flushed.
Pale will be my cheeks tomorrow,
  And my pleadings will be hushed.
Through long years of silent sorrow,
  I have loved the pet name so;
Then, my darling, call me darling,
  Speak it gently, ere I go.
