"Two on Earth, and Two in Heaven" (1858)
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Two on earth, their little feet,
Glance like sunbeams rounf the door;
Two in Heaven, whose lips repeat
Words of blessing evermore.
Two on earth, at shut of day,
Softly sink to cradled rest;
Two in Heaven, more blest than they
Slumber on an angels breast.

2.
Two with crowns of budding flowers
Dance the summer skies beneath;
Two in heaven's unfading bowers
Wear the glory like a wreath.
Two on earth whose merry call
Stirs my heart to gladness now;
Two in heaven whose kisses fall
Through the silence on my brow.

3.
Oft I gazed with tearful eye,
When the churchyard daisies blow;
Oft my prayers are only sighs
Yearning for my children so.
Yet I know an angel hand
Led them home in tender love;
Mine is sure a bless-ed hand,
Two on earth and two above.
