1. Through the green lanes of England the long summer’s day
We wander’d at will, in our youth’s merry may;
We gather’d the blooms o’er the hedgerows that hung,
Or mocked the sweet song that the Nightingale sung;
In the autumn we knew where the blackberries grew
  And the sky hazel nuts hidden deep in the shade,
Or with shouting and cheer when the Christmas drew near.
  In search of the ripe ruddy holly we strayed.

2. But the green lanes of England though dear to us then,
Were dearer by far when we grew to be men;
When the heart’s first emotions were fervent and pure,
And the world had no grief that a smile could not cure;
’Twas beneath the green leaves, in the calm summer eves,
  That we breathed the young hopes in our bosomes that burned;
Or in love’s gentle eyes, read the tender replies
  That showed the fond passion. we fondly returned.

3. Ye green lanes of England, wherever we roam
Ye are linked to our hearts, with the mem’ries of home;
With the sports of our childhood, the love of our prime,
And the pensive delights of a soberer time:
Other lands may be fair, with their balm breathing air,
  And their beauties and grandeur that charm or appall;
But to young and to old, till our hearts shall grow cold,
  Shall the green lanes of England, be dearer than all.
