"There's a Change in the Things We Love" (1843)
Words by Thomas Dunn English, 1819-1902
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
O dont you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,
  Sweet Alice with hair so brown;
Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile,
  And trembled with fear at your frown.
In the Old Church yard of the Abbey, Ben Bolt,
  In a corner obscure and alone,
They have fitted in a slab of the granite so gray,
  And Alice lies under the stone.

2.
O dont you remember the wood, Ben Bolt,
  That grew on the green sunny hill;
Where oft we have played 'neath its wide spreading shade
  And listened to Appleton's mill.
The mill has gone to decay, Ben Bolt,
  And the rafters have fallen in;
And a quiet has settled on all around
  In the place of the olden din.

3.
O dont you remember the school, Ben Bolt,
  With the master so cruel and grim;
And the quiet nook and the running brook,
  Where the school boys went to swim.
Grass grows on the master's grave, Ben Bolt,
  And the running brook is dry;
And of all the boys who were school-mates then,
  There is only you and I.

4.
There's a change in the things I love, Ben Bolt,
  A change from the old to the new;
But I feel in the core of my heart, Ben Bolt,
  There never was change in you.
Twelve-months twenty have passed Ben Bolt,
  But still with delight I hail,
Thy presence a blessing, thy friendship a truth,
  Ben Bolt of the salt sea gale.
