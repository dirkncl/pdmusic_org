Rest thee now weary one, soft be thy pillow,
  Rest thee and dream of thy dear native home;
Dream of the hearts that far o’er the billow,
  Still love you and bless you where ever you roam;
Dream of the sister; whose tender caresses
  Clung to thy form in her weeping farewell;
Dream of your meeting, your joyful embraces,
  And the stories of love each shall hasten to tell;
Dream of thy home, of its dear youthful pleasures,
  Of the sports of the field, of the river and wood,
Thy Dream of thy mother, whose prayers ever rise,
  At morning, at noon and at evening for thee;
Sweet be thy dreams of her, richer the treasure,
  A mother’s warm blessing, than wealth of the sea.

Thy heart shall remember all these with its treasures,
  And mem’ry rush over thy soul like a flood.
Rest thee now weary one, soft is thy pillow,
  Reast thee and dream of the land of thy love;
Absence nor distance, nor rude rolling billow,
  To soul meeting soul can a barrier prove.
