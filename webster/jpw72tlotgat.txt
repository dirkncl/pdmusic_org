Song
Words by Sanford Fillmore Bennett, 1836-1898
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I sat at my window one evening,
A watching the sunset's gold;
And thinking of ones I was loving
With love that can never grow old;
When an angel, descending beside me,
Seem'd watching the gold and the blue,
And she whisper'd, "Oh Teacher, pray lead them
To the love of the Good and the True."

CHORUS
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
And she whisper'd, "Oh Teacher, pray lead them
To the love of the Good and the True."

2.
Her garments were white as the snowflake
That drifts from the fields of Heav'n,
Her hair was a wonderful glory
By shafts of the summer sun riven,
And her face like a lily that opens
White heart to the touch of the dew,
As she whisper'd, "Oh Teacher, pray lead them
To the love of the Good and the True."

CHORUS
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
As she whisper'd, "Oh Teacher, pray lead them
To the love of the Good and the True."

3.
Then I thought of the young hearts about me,
The young eyes that look'd in mine,
And queried if seeds I had planted
Would blossom in flowers divine;
Then I bended my head to the easement,
I prayed for Love's guidance anew,
And I promised the angel to lead them
To the love of the Good and the True.

CHORUS
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
And I promised the angel to lead them
To the love of the Good and the True.

4.
Since then, though I see not, the angel
I know at my side doth stand,
And cheers me when doubting by touches
Of love from her heavenly hand;
A whisper of love ever strengthens;
My faith that is weak I renew,
And I strive with the angel to lead them
To the love of the Good and the True.

CHORUS
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
To the love of the Good and True, (Good and True,)
And I strive with the angel to lead them
To the love of the Good and the True.
