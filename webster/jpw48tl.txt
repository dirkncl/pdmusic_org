1. 
Tread lightly tread lightly dis turb not his sleep 
From his pains he’s released tho’ friends o’er him weep 
Speak softly speak softly for he whom we love 
Has gone to the regions of glory above. 

2. 
Tread lightly tread lightly move softly around 
’Tis a friend that now sleepeth oh breath not a sound 
The low muffled drum and the martial array 
In friendship do gather to bare him away. 

3. 
Companion beloved thy memory shall twine 
as close round our heart  as some evergreen vine 
For sweetly and gent ly thou sand to thy rest 
A spirit by Deity call’d to the blast. 

4. 
Tread lightly tread lightly in silence all keep 
His pains are all o’er let Wa trous now sleep 
No sound can awake him tho’ the bosom may swell 
Friend christian companion we bid thee farewell.
