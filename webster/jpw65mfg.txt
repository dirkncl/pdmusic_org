"My Father's Grave" (1865)
Song & Chorus
With profound respect and esteem
this little Song is inscribed to his friend
MRS. E. B. DEWING,
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
As evening shadows wrap me round,
And whipperwill resumes her song,
I tread that consecrated ground
Where sleep in death a vanish'd throng:
Once more I come with homage true
For one whose life love could not save,
Here may I weep and flowers strew
Upon my honored Father's grave.
CHORUS
Breath soft and low, O gentle wind,
Fair flowers cast your sweets around,
Flow pent-up tears; a Father kind,
'Sleeps well' beneath this grassy mound.

2.
How oft in childhood's thoughtless hours
I've stood upon this hallowed spot,
With merry playmates plucking flowers --
The daisy and forget-me-not;
Or, in the dear old orchard there,
My heart with happiness aglow --
With Father walked 'neath branches rare
Where golden fruits wet bending low.

(CHORUS)

3.
And later, when more youthful joys
On Time's relentless wings had flown,
'Mid all these scenes my Father's voice
Still cheered and bless'd me woman grown;
Around our board kind friends did meet,
And welcome friend with homely cheer,
O, God was good, and life was sweet,
When this was home, and Father here.

(CHORUS)

4.
But Father dear, you may not know
The cruel change that Time hath wrought;
A stranger's hand now guides the plow
Through fields with dearest mem'ries fraught;
The friends of other days are gone --
Or lost beneath affliction's wave --
And I, a pilgrim and lone,
Fine welcome only at your grave.

(CHORUS)
