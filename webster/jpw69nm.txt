1. Good health to yez, Nora MacRae. 
Long life to y’r swate little brither. 
A health to them all who came over wid ye. 
Ah Nora dear, how’s ye ould mither; 
Good ’cess to the darlin ould ship. 
That bro’t yez across the big water, 
Och, Nora ’tis a pleasure to moisten my lips, 
Wid a toast to y’r ould mither’s dar’ter.

2. Good health to yez, Nora MacRae. 
It’s long I’ve been sighin’ and waitin’, 
An’ sitin’ and watchin’ each swell of the say, 
The heart of me swellin’ and baitin’; 
But now yez have come I’ll forget, 
That ever I tho’t of self slaughter, 
Ah, Nora excuse me, I’ll take summat wet, 
To me darlint, y’r ould mither’s daughter.

3. Good health to yez, Nora MacRae. 
It’s happy I am to behold yez, 
In me sorrow I dhrank siv’ral times of the day, 
An’ sure ’tis the truth as I’ve told yez; 
But now I am that full of joy, 
Me mouth is beginin’ to wather, 
Ah, Nora me darlint, Mike Rourke is the boy, 
That ’ud dhrink to y’r ould mither’s daughter.

4. Good health to yez, Nota MacRae. 
Let us find the good Father McFarden. 
I’ve a beautiful cottage, dear, down by the say, 
And a dacint white pig in the garden; 
One flesh will be made right away, 
Nor wait for one thing or anither, 
And thin Nora dear, darling, Nora MacRae, 
We’ll take a wee dhrop to each ither.
