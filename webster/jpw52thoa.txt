1. 
Wake Lady wake— the bright stars are shining,
And Zephy’s dance gaily o’er the posy deck’d lea.
The minstrel of love, thy young heart beguiling,
Strikes the harp of affection to love and to thee.
The harp, that so long hath lain pensive and silent,
Sends forth its soft tones in a sweet melody;
And the birds of the morrow, in notes of enchantment,
Will join in glad chorus to love and to thee.

2. 
The pale moonbeams glancing— the winds in their softness—
The stars that sit twinkling o’er heaven’s deep sea.
All, all in their brightness, and beauty and freshness,
Are shining and sighing to love and to thee.
The moss rose is weeping— the dewdrop is stealing
A down her bright cheek and a sigh is set free.
From her bosom of beauty, while night music pealing,
Ascends in its gladness to love and to thee.
