1. The better day brightly is dawning,
  Dismayed is all error and sin;
All hail to the beautiful morning;
  Millennium ushering in.
Farewell to election corruptions,
  Of which the whole world has ta’en note;
Let ev’ry man mind his own buttons,
  For woman is going to vote.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
She lectures and doctors, and preaches;
  And notes the new cut of a coat;
She’ll mend our political breaches,
  And renovate all with her vote.

2. For ages the lords of creation,
  Have managed things all their own way;
Law makers, executives, judges,
  Their genius has always had play.
Claiming ever to be democratic,
  All species of caste have they smote;
But won’t there be many wry faces
  When woman shall walk up to vote?

3. There’ll have to be diff’rent arrangements,
  When ever election comes round;
No chewing, nor smoking, nor swearing,
  At the polls shall hereafter be found;
Nor yet shall there be any drinking,
  Nor betting, not even a groat;
And men will please take off their beavers,
  When woman shall put in her vote.

4. We’ll have the whole thing reconstructed,
  It’s wrong, from beginning to end;
We’re cut, and we’re made, and we’re fitted,
  Indeed we all know how to mend;
We’re exercised far greater talents,
  In keeping our husbands afloat.
Come Harry, Tom, Dick, mind the cradle,
  We women are going to vote.
