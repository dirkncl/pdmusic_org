1. My Lily’s fairer than the flow’rs
  That bless the sunny hills;
I  hear her voice in summer winds,
  And in the laughing rills;
Her dimpled cheek the rose would shame,
  Her eyes the violets blue,
Her fair brow pales the lily’s white,
  Her loving heart is true.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Sweet love crown thee, gentle Lily,
  Angel guide thy tender feet,
In the paths of love when waking,
  Guarding thee in slumber sweet.

2. My Lily’s fairer than the stars,
  And sweeter than the May,
Her voice glides thro’ the music bars,
  And charms my heart away;
But all the brightness of the skies,
  Her sweet eyes can outshine,
When then in maiden trustfulness
  Look lovingly in mine.

3. Than all the fairest things of earth
  My Lily fairer seems;
Far sweeter to her voice to me
  Than music heard in dreams;
And by and by her smile shall bless,
  That little cot of mine,
Where falls the sunlight at the door,
  And climbs the fragrant vine.
