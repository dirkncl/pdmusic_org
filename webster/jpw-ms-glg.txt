Beautiful child, with golden hair, 
Sweet little girl, so young, so fair, 
With your smiling face and your eyes so blue, 
Say, “Whose little girl are you?” 

[CHORUS]
A lovelier child was never born, 
She was going to Sundayschool that morn.
When I asked, “Whose little girl are you?” 
She said: “I’m Dod’s ’itle dirl— ’at’s ’oo.”
