1.
How sweet to sing thy praise,
Our Father and our King!
To thee our choral thanks to raise,
And tuneful off'rings bring.

2.
Thou lovest Zion's throngs,
When gathered in thy praise,
And hearest when our greatful song,
To thee we humbly raise.

3.
So sings the angel band
Before thy throne of light,
And praises fill the heavenly land,
Made blessed in thy sight.

4.
Lord, bend a list'ning ear
While we our off'rings bring!
O, let thy loving spirit here
Inspire us while we sing!
