1. O give to me the water cold,
That bubbles from the spring!
To cheeks of snow that grateful draught
The rose of health will bring!
In gleams at morning in the dew,
It falls in gentle rain,
Grows up again in sweetest flow’rs,
And waving fileds of grain. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
O that is the drink for me, 
O that is the drink for me, 
shining as bright as the light of the morning.
Oh, that is the drink for me.

2. The rivulets leap from the hills,
Like children in their play,
Run smiling to the meadpws gree,
And sing along the way.
The ruby wine give not to me
Though temptingly do shine!
In every place the limped cup
Fom Nature’s spring be mine!
