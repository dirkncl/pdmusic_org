1. The birds sing praises unto God,
In dell and leafy grove:
From rosy morn to dewy eve,
They sing the song of love.

2. Ere man has risen from his couch
To bend the knee to prayer,
Each warbler tunes his songful throat
And charms the morning air.

3. Learn of the birds to sweetly sing--
Thy teachers let them be,
To lift above the grateful song,
In tuneful melody.

4. And He shall hear thy morning song,
Who taught the birds to sing,
And water thine aspiring heart,
From Love's perpetual spring.
