1. O, clouds that hang o’er thee today
Full of darkest sorrow,
Wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
To suffer not that tear
Adown thy cheek to stray,
Nor let they heart so drear
To idle grief give way
For morrow,
Tomorrow,
Tomorrow,
Wave by wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
Tomorrow.


2. Then clouds that hang o’er thee today
Full of darkest sorrow,
Wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
To let no dewy tear
Upon thy lashes rest;
Nor anxious thought, nor fear,
Find shelter in thy breast
For morrow,
Tomorrow,
Tomorrow,
Wave by wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
Tomorrow.


3. Dear clouds that hang o’er thee today
Full of darkest sorrow,
Wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
To [me, was cares for] all,
Most surely cares for thee,
Who marks the sparrow’s fall
Will watch o’er you and me
For morrow,
Tomorrow,
Tomorrow,
Wave by wave by wave shall float away
And let sunshine in
Tomorrow.
