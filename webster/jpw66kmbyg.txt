1. While your path lies over the hillside,
  Away in the rain and the sleet,
Or out in the world’s wildest turmoil,
  Where business and pleasure may meet—
I linger around the dear fireside
  Where fanciful embers will glow
With lifelife and flickering motion—
  Kiss me before you go.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Kiss me,
Kiss me,
Kiss me before you go.

2. And my quiet way still be haunted
  With visions to other can see—
With glances more precious than diamonds,
  And smiles full of meaning to me;
With sounds of an e’er welcome footstep—
  A whisper so thrillingly low—
Ah! Thought will clasp Memory closely—
  Kiss me before you go.

3. For life has a thousand mischances,
  And one of these chances may fall;
We two, ne’er again by the firelight,
  May one shadow make on the wall;
Then here in the shadow of parting—
  Since cruel fate orders it so—
O leave me a fond benediction—
  Kiss me before you go.
