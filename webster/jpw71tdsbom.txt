"The Dear Sweet Bells of Memory" (3 Apr. 1871)
Words by Margaret Bothwell Stewart
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Sweet mem'ry bells! their witching chimes
Have charms as dear as olden rhymes;
We hear them oft at twilight hour
When sets the sun and shuts the flower.

CHORUS
O happy bells, O chiming bells,
The dear, sweet bells of memory,
O happy bells, O chiming bells,
The dear, sweet bells of memory,
O happy bells, O chiming bells,
The dear, sweet bells of memory.

2.
When Luna's mystic silver light
Bathes hill and dale at noon of night,
Then voices ring with magic strain,
Breaking the calm with sweet refrain.

(CHORUS)

3.
Telling of childhood's joyous lays,
And hopes and fears of bygone days;
Of bridal vows and farewells said,
And solemn dirges for the dead.

(CHORUS)

4.
Soon, soon our weary feet shall tread
That land where no sad tears are shed;
Soon we shall clasp the hand of friends,
Where with the song song no discord blends.

(CHORUS)
