1. I love to sing of the Cottage home
Where dwells my Jennie Maud,
Where yellow roses sweetly bloom,
O’er winddows low and broad;
And winging to the locust shade,
The wild  bird warbling loud,
To hear the music sweetly made,
The song of Jennie Maud.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Up with earnest rosy morn,
Claiming wild birds with her song,
Rounding o’er the hills so green,
Like some little fairy queen.

2. Now to the market she quickly hies,
With basket rich and rare,
The bloom upon her cheek outvies;
The luscious fruit she bears;
The bright light in her blue eye tells,
A mind so free from cloud,
And soon her choicest fruit she sells,
The bonnie Jennie Maud.

3. She looks so charming, pure and bright,
With dancing curls of brown,
With gypsy hat and dress of white,
And face that knows no frown;
She teaches roses where to twine,
She gives the white doves food,
The honeysuckle wreaths its vine,
For my sweet Jennie Maud.

4. Her wee brown hands the showy cloth
Now sprouts with charming grace,
Her springing footstep is not loth
To aid in ev’ry place;
Her sweetest voice has whisper’d me,
The vow of which I’m proud,
That at some future day to be,
My bride, my Jennie Maud.,
