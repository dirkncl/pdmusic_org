"Oh God, Hear Their Cry!" (1878)
A Beautiful Song suggested by the terrible
Yellow Fever Sufferings in the south.
A melody by Jospeh Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875
Written & Adapted by Mrs. Clara Richie

1.
From the fair sunny south, where winds whisper low
And birds sing the livelong day;
Where bright flowers nod, in the sun's golden glow,
And Autumn is fair as may --
Where all thro' the day, roses burst in to bloom,
And the reaper doth bind every sheaf --
There comes now a wall, of sorrow and gloom,
From Kinsmen nigh weighed down with grief.

CHORUS
Father hear, hear our prayer,
Save our brothers, from sorrow and pain;
Take a way the dark clouds that hang over them there --
Show them thy mercy again.

2.
The father with kind words, for each and all,
The mother with sweet, gentle grace,
The child's silv'ry laugh, ringing out thro' the ha;;,
The maiden with bright sunny face --
All, all are gone, and over that fair land,
Where joy filled the vine-trimmed home --
A blow dealt by an unseen hand --
In silence and shadow hath come.

(CHORUS)

3.
For the grief-stricken ones who have bowed o'er the bier,
For mothers now childless and lone;
For Orphans, who never have known aught to care;
For fathers whose loved ones are gone.
We now send forth a heart felt prayer
That their trials and sorrows are o'er;
Oh, God! heed their tears, show thy mercy, there,
And spare them forever more.

(CHORUS)
