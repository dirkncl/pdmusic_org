1. I am waiting for the shadows,
  To be lifted from my path,
Till the clouds shall cease to gather,
  And the storm has spent its wrath;
I am toiling till my burden
  Shall be loosed and I am free,
Till my trials all have ended,
  And, has dawned eternity.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[with overlapping voices]
[S]
I am waiting, only waiting,
  Till this weary life is o’er,
When beyond the misty river,
  I shall rest forever more.
When beyond the misty river,
  I shall rest forever more.
[ATB]
I am waiting, waiting, waiting,
  only waiting, waiting, waiting,
Till this weary, weary, weary,
  life is o’er, life is o’er,
When beyond, beyond the cold and stormy
  dark and misty river,
I shall rest forever, rest forever
  more, ever more,
When beyond, beyond the cold and stormy
  dark and misty river,
I shall rest, rest, rest forever more.

2. I am praying till my Master,
  Rending from His great, white throne,
Calling me, shall say, “my servant
  Faithfull thou hast been, well done,”
I am fighting till the battle
  Shall be won, and by my side
I have laid my battered armour,
  By the river’s swelling tide.
