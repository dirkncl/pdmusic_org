1.
The wood was in its summer leaf, Margaret, my Margaret;
And golden grain was in the sheaf, Margaret, my Margaret;
The birds that filled the air with song,
Sweet summer time did still prolong,
When last we wound these banks along, Margaret, my Margaret.

2.
How bright was then the sunset's gleam, Margaret, my Margaret;
How gently flowed the rippling stream, Margaret, my Margaret;
But brighter far than gleam of sun,
And smoother than the brooklet's run,
Seemed life to us-- its glory won-- Margaret, my Margaret.

3.
With joyful hearts we rambled on, Margaret, my Margaret;
Nor noted we when day had gone, Margaret, my Margaret;
The sunset's gleam was in your eye,
The zephyr's sweetness in your sigh,
And still the laughing stream went by, Margaret, my Margaret.

4.
Gone now are birds and summer leaves, Margaret, my Margaret;
Old Time has garnered many sheaves, Margaret, my Margaret;
The winding brooklet murmurs still
The songs which did our young hearts thrill,
But we are passing down the hill, Margaret, my Margaret.
