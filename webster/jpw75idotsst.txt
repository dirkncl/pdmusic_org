To Rev. P. S. Van Nest.
"I'm Dreaming of the Sweet Spring Time" (1875)
Words Rev. Mrs. Van Nest
Music Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I'm dreaming of the sweet spring time
When life's young dreams were new,
When visions of the bright new years
Were clad in richest hue;
And stars with purest radiance shone
On silver streams while gliding on
Farewell old home, dear home, sweet home,
Farewell for evermore.

CHORUS
Farewell old home, dear home, sweet home,
On silver streams while gliding on
Farewell old home farewell, farewell,
Farewell forevermore.
On silver streams while gliding on
Farewell forevermore.

2.
I'm dreaming of a bridal scene
Within a vine clad cot
Before faith on the altar laid
The true forgetmenot.
And tearfully as loved ones smiled
The mother gave away her child
Farewell sweet morn by her beguiled
Farewell forevermore.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'm dreaming of the autumn morn
When rainbow hues are spread
Like daily mercies from above
Across the path we tread.
And music from the old plain hill
Through mem'ries chambers wildly still
Ring out my darling's home farewell
Farewell forevermore.

(CHORUS)
