For President Ulysses Grant.
"A Smoking His Cigar" (24 May 1868)
Words by Ason O'Fagun
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
At Donelson the rebel horde
Had gathered in their might,
Determined there with fire and sword
To make a dreadful fight.
But gallant Foote, with his command
Wept "in" by water route,
While Grant besieged upon the land,
And smoked the rebels "out."

CHORUS
Where volleyed thunder loudest pealed,
Along the front of war,
The Gen'ral calmly viewed the field,
A smoking his cigar.

2.
And Beauregard did swear, methinks,
Upon his bended knee,
That his good horse should have some drinks,
All from the Tennessee;
But oh! a "dip twixt cup and lip"
That sweet illusion broke;
For Grant just [smote?] 'em thigh and hip,
And made the rebels smoke.

(CHORUS)
