Sung at Kelly & Leon's Academy of Music.
Song & Chorus.
Words by E. B. Dewing
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
While old Uncle Sam was busy--
  Not so very long ago--
With his dear rebellious children,
  There crept into Mexico
From across the bright blue water,
  Under "Naps'" imerial wing,
A young scion of the Hapsburgs,
  Who was spoiling to be King.

CHORUS
Oh, poor Max, there's no use talking--
  So pack up your kit and go,
For the Universal Nation says,
  "Get out of Mexico!
|: Get out of Mexico!
  Get out of Mexico!"
For the Universal Nation says,
  "Get out of Mexico!" :|

2.
Now political tradition,
  Since the time of James Monroe,
Had prevented interference
  In affairs of Mexico,
By the crowned heads of Europe,
  Until just the moment when
Uncle Sam had both his hands full
  With some desp'rate naughty men.

(CHORUS)

3.
"Nappy" thought the Great Republic
  So by war and faction torn,
That no more in pride and triumph
  Would the starry flag be borne;
But in spite of British cruisers,
  Notwithstanding French intrique,
Proudly floats that tri-hued banner
  Over every native league.

(CHORUS)

4.
Now our "cruel war is over,"
  We're united all once more,
Universal peace and freedom
  Haply reign from shore to shore--
Uncle Sam has thirty million
  Loyal hearts, who want to know
If the vagrant, Maximillian,
  Won't get out of Mexico.

(CHORUS)
