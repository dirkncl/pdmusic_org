  During the Battle of Gettysburg, the heroic girl who
is the subject of the following song, was making bread
for our soldiers in a house between the two armies,
and exposed to the fire of both, although repeatedly
urged, she would not desist from her labors, and fell
victim to her patriotism.

1. 
Rear high the monumental pile
Of marble pure and white.
A life which gladdened earth erewhile
Has passed to realms of light.
Rear high the monumental pile
To one who hated wrong;
And tearful bards her fame the while
Perpetuate in song.

CHORUS [sung after verses 1 thru 3 only]
In the quiet churchyard sleeping
With our bravest fitly laid,
Moan the winds thro’ willows weeping,
O’er the grave of Jenny Wade.

2. 
When man has done some gallant deed,
We yield a wild acclaim,
And booming cannons speak the mead
Bestowed upon his name.
If death on battlefield he braved,
And served his country well,
We wrap him in the flag that waved
Above him when he fell.

3. 
When to the north wind rebels threw
Their noisome traitor rag,
The courage of a woman true,
Upheld the dear old flag.
Where ere that starty flag shall wave,
’Mid clouds or on the plain;
Remember’d be thy hallow’d grave,
For home and country stain.

4. 
Thy bright example still shall nerve
Our soldiers in the fight.
Tho’ dead thy spirit yet shall serve
Free men defending right.
Thy death a nation long shall mourn.
Thy deeds embellish arts.
Thy name on breeze and billow bourne,
Thy mem’ry in our hearts.

CHORUS [sung after the last verse only]
Fare thee well sweet spirit! never
Shall thy wreath of laurel fade;
Fragrant flow’rs shall bloom forever
O’er the grave of Jenny Wade.
