1. The little seed long laid to rest
Upon earth's cold and pulseless breast,
Warmed by the sun, grows up to be
A flower that cheers and blesses thee.
A seed of truth sown in the heart,
Warmed by God's love, will sometimes start,
And growing in its beauty there,
Full bud, and leaf, and flower bear.

2. Have faith to sow the gospel seed!
More earnest workers God doth need,
And one, longing for the true, 
Turns for instruction's voice to you.
Be not discouraged, though the field
More weed than flowers seems to yield,
For God will stoop from Heaven on high,
And give the blessing by and by.
