1. Oh! weep no more beloved one!
  My pinions heavy with thy tears,
Droop low when I would wing them out,
  Among the calm and shining spheres.

CHORUS 1-3.
Doest thou not feel the smiles I shed?
  Canst thou not hear me when I call—
Lift up thy lov’d and weary head
  And feel the balm of healing fall.

2. I come to thee when eve hath brought,
  Her solemn splendor to the sky;
I come to bless each holy thought,
  With benediction from on high.

3. Be patient for these few short years,
  Thro’ paths of faithful duty come;
A tender hand shall wipe thy tears,
  A faithful heart receive thee home.
