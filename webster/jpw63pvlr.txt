1.
The years are creeping slowly by, dear Paul,
The winters come and go;
The winds weep past with mournful cry, dear Paul,
And pelt my face with snow;
But there's none upon the heart, dear Paul,
'Tis summer always there;
Those early loves throw sunshine over all,
And sweeten mem'ries dear.

2.
I thought it easy to forget, dear Paul,
Life glowed with youthful hope;
The glorious future gleamed yet, dear Paul,
And bade us clamber up;
_They_ frowning said, "It must not cannot be;
Break now, the hopeless bands!"
And Paul, you know how well that bitter day,
I bent to their commands.

3.
I've kept you ever in my heart, dear Paul,
Tho' years of good and ill;
Our _souls_ could not be torn apart, dear Paul,
They're bound together still.
I never knew how dear your were to me
'Till I was left alone;
I thought my poor, poor heart would break the day
They told me you was gone.

4.
Perhaps we'll never, never meet, dear Paul,
Upon this earth again;
But _there_, where happy angels greet, dear Paul,
You'll meet Lorena there.
Together up the ever shining way,
We'll press with hoping heart--
Together through the bright eternal day,
And never more to part.
