1.
Freemen! from your slumbers wake!
Freemen! from your thraldom break!
Let the hills and valleys quake
"'Neath your rallying tread!"
Wrong is trampling now on Right,
Men of youth are men of Might!
Sons of Liberty unite!
Or your hopes are dead!

2.
Shall the blood of brothers slain,
Crying from the ground in vain,
Longer unavenged remain
For a single day?
Shall the land your fathers swore
Should be "free forevermore"
Reek with murder'd patriots gore,
Sons of Freemen say!

3.
Hear your foes their triumph tell!
Hear them swear your souls to quell!
Blacker than the gates of hell,
See their banner wave!
Hear their cruel battle cry,
See the demon in their eye!
Freemen! you who fear to die,
Are tomorrow, slaves!

4.
Scorn the lying traitors charms!
Fired with Feedoms loud alarms,
Haste ye with your strong right arms
Bared for victory!
Like the wild tornadaoes stride,
Like the oceans mighty tide,
Rolling deep and rolling wide,
Let your onset lie!
