1. Home is sad without a mother,
Gloom and darkness hover there;
Eyes of childhood wet with weeping,
Speak of darkness and despair.
Kiss me sister; love me brother—
Home is sad without a mother.
  Kiss me sister; love me brother—
  Home is sad without a mother.

2. Home is sad without a mother,
Mouldering yonder in the tomb;
Hands we often felt caressing
Silken curls in childhood’s home.
Kiss me sister; love me brother—
Home is sad without a mother.
  Kiss me sister; love me brother—
  Home is sad without a mother.

3. Home is sad without a mother—
Vacant is the old arm chair;
Lips of love are cold and silent,
Silent in the churchyard there.
Kiss me sister; love me brother—
Home is sad without a mother.
  Kiss me sister; love me brother—
  Home is sad without a mother.

4. Home is sad without a mother—
Up there in that spirit land,
Father, mother, sister, borther,
Form a circle, hand in hand.
Kiss me sister; love me brother—
Home is sad without a mother.
  Kiss me sister; love me brother—
  Home is sad without a mother.
