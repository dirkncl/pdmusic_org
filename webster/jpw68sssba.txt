1. Summer’s fragrant blooms are dead;
  Summer’s birds have flown away;
Summer loves, whose sweetness shed
  Gladness through the sunny day;
And my life is stripped and bare,
  Frozen in the wintry air;
And my heart lies cold and low
  In its grave beneath the snow.
Surely winter’s spite is vain;
  Summer sweets shall bloom again—

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[overlapping voices]
[SA]
Bloom again, bloom again,
  Summer’s sweets shall bloom again;
Bloom again, bloom again,
  Summer’s sweets shall bloom again.
[TB]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
  Summer’s sweets shall bloom again;
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
  Summer’s sweets shall bloom again;

2. Summer’s fragrant rose shall blow
  Sweeter in the early year;
And the joys of long ago
  By and by shall reappear;
Hope return on blither wing,
  With the happy birds of spring;
And my heart, now cold and low,
  Leave its grave beneath the snow.
Surely winter’s spite is rain;
  Summer sweets still bloom again—

3. Let the dead past hide its tombs
  Under winter’s veiling snows;
But the sweetest of life’s blooms,
  Like frail summer’s dewy rose,
Shall unclose, more fresh and fair
  In the blossom scented air,
When my heart, so cold and low,
  Leaves its grave beneath the snow.
Surely winter‘s spite is vain;
  Summer sweets shall bloom again—
