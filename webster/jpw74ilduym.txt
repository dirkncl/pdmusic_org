"I'm Looking Down Upon You Mother" (1874)
Words by Rev. J. W. Carhart
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I'm looking down upon you, mother,
Said a sweet and laughing voice;
And a chubby face hung o'er her,
Youngest born, the mother's choice.
I'm looking down upon you, mother,
Now good night, a kiss I throw;
I shall see you in the morning,
Mother dear, I love you so!
I shall see you in the morning,
Mother dear I love you so!

2.
From the holy lights above us,
Where the stars their vigils keep,
Cherub eyes look down upon us,
As we watch, and wait, and weep,
I'm looking down upon you, mother,
Hear the angel voices say;
And I kiss you in the zephyr,
Or with evening's farewell ray,
And I kiss you in the zephyr,
Or with evening's farewell ray.

3.
Clouds of witnesses behold us,
As we run life's weary race;
They are waiting to receive us,
In a fond and long embrace.
Then look up, ye pilgrims weary;
See bright faces in the skies,
See the beckoning hands beyond you,
Where the domes of glory rise,
See the beckoning hands beyond you,
Where the domes of glory rise.
