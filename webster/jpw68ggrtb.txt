1.
Gather gently round the bier!
One we loved is sleeping here!
Soft and rev'rent be our tread,
In the presence of the dead.

2.
Angels called the little one,
Ere life's work had scarce begun,
To the blessed heavenly shore,
There to sing forevermore.

3.
Well we know our little friend
Walks where pleasures never end,
And will meet us on that shore,
When we walk the earth no more.

4.
We shall press no more his hand,
We shall miss him in our band,
Search in vain his wonted place,
For the radiance of his face.

5.
Blessed Father help us all
To be waiting for thy call,
Fearing not in thee to die,
And ascend to thee on high.
