"Our Own" (1869)
Words by Luke Collin
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Other lands may be enchanting,
Other airs may be more bland,
Other valleys more alluring,
Other steeps more wildly grand;
But we have a deeper feeling,
Warmer, kindlier far in tone.
For the dear familiar feature,
Of the land we call our own.

CHORUS
Other hearts (may throb) may throb (may throb) with pleasure,
Sweet as meadows, (meadows,) newly mown. (newly mown.)
But they may (not, may) not know the meas- (-ure, meas-) -ure,
Of the joys (, the joys) we call our own.

2.
Other homes may be more lovly,
Other fields more fair to view,
Other groves perchance more leafy,
Othe skies a brighter blue;
But wherever fancy wanders,
Naught whereon the sun has shone,
Kindless in our hearts such rapture,
As the scenes we call our own.

(CHORUS)

3.
Other friends may be as charming,
Other children passing fair,
Other wives and husbands constant,
Other lovers strangely rare;
Still no realm no home pleasant,
Over which the wind has blown,
No fond hearts so sweetly perfect,
As the darlings called our own.

(CHORUS)
