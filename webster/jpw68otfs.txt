1. On the further shore, on the further shore,
Where the ills of life shall beset no more,
Where the tired hand rests, where our strivings cease,
And our wounds are healed by the balm of peace,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We shall meet again, we shall meet again,
In the blessed byandby, we shall meet again.

2. On the further shore, on the further shore,
Are the friends who crossed in the days before;
In an our when faith shall be lost to sight,
We shall clasp their hands in the World of light—

3. On the further shore, on the further shore,
There is bliss untold for for the good in store,
And the heavenly bells with a golden chime
Shall the glad our thrill in that happy time,

4. On the further shore, on the further shore,
Do the angels sing and the Lord adore;
We shall join the chang of the Angel band,
And around the throne of the Father stand,
