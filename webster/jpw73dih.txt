"Drifting Into Harbor;
or, I Can See the Shining Shore" (1873)
Words by Rev. J. W. Carhart
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

Miss Mary Howland when dying said: "I am drifting from the earth
and the shore is rocky, Ma; But I shall have a pleasant home
with Jesus, I can see the shining shore!"

1.
I am drifting, drifting Mother
From the earth so rocky here,
But I'm going home sweet mother
Where is neither storm or fear.
Oh I'm going home to Jesus,
'Tis so bright on yonder shore
And the Boatman waits the bidding,
He will bear me safely o'er,
And the Boatman waits the bidding,
He will bear me safely o'er.

REFRAIN/Chorus
I am drifting into harbor,
I can see the "Shining shore,"
I am drifing into harbor,
Weep, oh, weep for me no more,
We are drifting into harbor,
We are drifting into harbor,
We are drifting into harbor,
We are on the "Shining shore,"
On the "Shining shore."

2.
I am drifting from the sorrow,
From the weeping and the woe;
I am drifting through the valley
Where the weary pilgrims go.
I am drifting from the darkness
From the mist across the sea
Oh, the day is breaking brightly,
And the angels beckon me,
Oh, the day is breaking brightly,
And the angels beckon me.

(REFRAIN/Chorus)

3.
I am drifting into harbor!
And I see the domes of gold!
And I'm list'ning to the angels
While the pearly gates unfold!
Cease your weeping darling loved ones
Swell with me the angels song
Lo! the Savior! Oh! the Savior!
Unto Him our songs be long,
Lo! the Savior! Oh! the Savior!
Unto Him our songs belong.

(REFRAIN/Chorus)
