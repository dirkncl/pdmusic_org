1.
O sing to me as when of old
I listened by your chair,
And envied e'en the sunset gold,
That nestled in your hair.
Sing softly, love; five golden years
Have dawned since those sweet hours:
The path we entered on with fears,
Has proved a walk of flowers.

QUARTETTE
Sing softly, love, sing softly,
Sweet are the hours that fly
While you and I together sit
As in the days gone by.

2.
I gaze into your earnest eyes,
The lovelight slumbers there,
As in an angel's bosom lies
The yet unuttered prayer.
My soul is kneeling as of old
A pilgrim at love's shrine;
To thee I tell the tale oft told
By lovers' lips ere mine.

(QUARTETTE)

3.
The south wind softly hastens by,
A murmur, as of prayer,
Seems wafting from the sunny sky,
And fills the slumbrous air;
I know the hand that rests in mine
Shall lead me hence for aye,
As in our merry marriage time,
It led my heart away.

(QUARTETTE)
