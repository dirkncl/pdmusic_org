"The Old Door Step" (1880)
Ballad
Poetry by "Orlie"
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I'm sitting on the old door-step
  Where we so oft have sat,
And pass'd the happy hours of youth
  In gay and social chat;
And tho' the thought now bringeth tears
  Of sorrow deep and sad,
Yet still is mingled with those drops
  Some feelings bright and glad.
Yet still is mingled with those drops
  Some feelings bright and glad.

2.
We oft have sat at twilight's hour,
  And wished the future near,
And deemed within our guileless hearts,
  That future bright and clear.
But sadder thoughts were there in store,
  And though we knew it not,
We've drained the cup since then, dear friend,
  With disapointment fraught.
We've drained the cup since then, dear friend,
  With disapointment fraught.

3.
And though we prayed that life might prove
  A path of roses, free
From cares and trials that beset,
  Poor, frail mortality.
We've found that pathway, dark and drear,
  The roses faded lay;
And we no more in love shall meet
  Upon that old door-way.
And we no more in love shall meet
  Upon that old door-way.
