1. Children do you love the Savior,
He who died that you might live?
You will find it sweetest pleasure,
All your heart to Him to give.
He has loved you, loved you ever.
Guards you in the night and day,
And will cease to love you never,
If to Him you humbly pray.

2. Love Him in your life's fresh morning,
Ere the noontide heats shall come,
Or the falling gloom of eveining
Tells you that life's day is done.
From the land of light and glory,
Lo! He bends a listening ear
Waiting for love's blessed story,
Breathing through each heartfelt prayer.

3. Children do you love the Savior?
He will gently lead you on,
Out of fear and out of danger,
To a bright and heavenly home,
Where the angel bands will meet you,
And will love you evermore,
Striking harps of gold to meet you,
Mid the glories of the shore.
