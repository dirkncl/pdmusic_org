1. Close her eyelids— press them gently
O’er the dead and leadon eyes,
For the soul that made them lovely,
Hath rerurn’d unto the skies,
Wave the death damps from her forehead,
Sever this dear little tress,
Fold her icy hands all meekly,
Smooth her little snowy dress;
Scatter flowers o’er her pillow,
Gentle flowers, so pure and white—
Lay the bud upon her bosom,
Then, now softly say, Goodnight.

2. Tho’ our tears flow fast and faster,
Yet we “would not call her back,”
We are glad her feet no longer,
Tread life’s rough and stormy truck;
We are gkad our Heav’nly Father
Took her whilr her heart was puire,
We are glad He did not leave her
All life’s trials to endure,
We are glad— and yet the teardrop
Falleth; for alas we know
That our foreside will be lonely,
We shall miss our darling so.

3. While the twilight shadows gather,
We shall wail in vain to find
Little arms, all white and fimpled,
Round our neck so softly steal;
Our wet cheek shall miss the pressure
Of sweet lips so warm and red,
And our bosom sadly, sadly,
Miss that darling little hand
Which was wont to rest there sweetly;
And those radiant eyes so bright,
We shall miss their loving glances,
We shall miss their soft Good night.

4. When the morrow’s sun is shining
They will take this cherished form,
They will bear it to the churchyard,
And consign it to the storm;
Well— what matter? It is only
The day dress our darling wore;
God hath robed her as an angel,
She hath need of this no more;
Fold her hands and o’er her pillow
Scatter fllowers all pure and white,
Kiss the marble brow and whisper,
Once again, a last Good night.
