1. Did you ever see our baby?
  Little Tot,
With her eyes so sparkling bright,
And her skin so lily white,
Lips and cheeks of rosy light—
  Tell you what;
She is just the sweetest baby
  In the lot.

2. Ah! she is our only darling
  And to me,
All her little ways are witty;
When she sings her little ditty
Ev’ry word is just as pretty
  As can be—
Not another in the city
  Sweet as she.

3. You don’t think so— you ne’er saw her!
  Wish you could
See her with her playthings clattering,
Hear her little tongue a chattering—
Little dancing feet come pattering—
  Think you would
Love her just as well as I do—
  If you could!

4. Ev’ry mother’s only darling,
  I suppose,
Is as sweet and bright a blossom,
Is a treasure to her bosom,
Is as cheering and endearing
  As my rose—
Heavenly Father, spare them to us
  Till life’s close.
