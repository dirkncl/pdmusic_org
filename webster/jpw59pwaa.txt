1. When night around the slumb’ring earth,
  Had drawn his curtain gray;
Then lowly by a new made grave,
  A young child kneeled to pray:
A sweet young child with golden head,
  Bent as bows the lily fair,
Beneath its weight of pearly dew
  Upon the cold and there.

2. His hands upon his sinless breast,
  Childlike were folded meek;
Whilst sorrow’s bitter burning tears
  Fell o‘er his tender cheek:
“Dear Father, God,” the sweet child said,
  Poor Willie’s all alone;
Oh! Father take Thy little one
  Where dear mama is gone.

3. There’s none to love poor Willie now;
  The night is damp and chill;
Oh! send my mama for her child,
  Down from the shiny hill.
Poor Willie ne’er can find the path,
  Among the stars to heaven;
For oh! it is a long way off,
  Above the clouds of eve’n

4. There was a cleaving of the air
  By something gleaming white;
A halo from a radiant one
  Lit up the dusky night,
Dear mama! you have come at last!
  Oh! fold me to your breast;
And on the Angel’s bosom laid,
  Poor Willie sank to rest.
