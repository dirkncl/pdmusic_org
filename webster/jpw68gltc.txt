1. God loves the children, we are taught,
He hold the weakest hand,
And helps each little foot to walk
Toward the Heavenly land.
He prompts the infant heart to ask
For money and for love;
He lendeth strength for ev'ry task,
That bars the way above.

2. He sometimes ope's the starry gates,
To gardens of the blest,
And takes the little one that waits
For loving and for rest.
Let children love the Holy One,
Who gives such gentle care,
Remembering who wears the crown,
The cross as well must bear.
