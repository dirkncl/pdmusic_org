"That's So; or, The Union Cause is Gaining Ground" (1863)
Words by Lowell Call
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
The Union Cause is gaining ground,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
And fusion to the traitor-crew,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
Our Vicksburg fight has passed to fame,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
And fusion to the traitor-crew,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.

2.
What made that victory so sublime,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
We Granted them a little time,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
We often Granted them before,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
And we expect to 'Grant' them more,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.

3.
Port Hudson too for Union ranks,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
Although the South don't like our Banks,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
Our Banks don't dear in worthless trash,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
But issue balls instead of cash,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.

4.
The traitors west will soon accede,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
But in the East they've got the 'Meade,'
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
And that's what's putting them to route,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
They'll were the Meade till they're worn out,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.

5.
'Tis true the South has got a Bragg,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
But Rosencrans will never lag,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
And while the South asserts their creed,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
They've got the Bragg but we the Meade,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.

6.
We've got a Hunter on their track,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
And we expect to bring them back,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
And when their hosts are put to route,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so,
The traitors north will played out,
  Ha! ha! ha! that's so too.
