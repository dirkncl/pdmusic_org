1. 
Sublime among the nations thou, 
Native  Land, my native Land, 
Dost stand God’s seal upon thy brow, 
Gracious Land, my native Land! 
God’s seal of Truth and Law and Right— 
And Freedom’s, set in starry light 
On the broad falchion of thy might,

CHORUS [sung after verses 1,2,4 only] 
Columbia, Columbia, Columbia, my native Land! 
Columbia, Columbia, Columbia, my native Land!

CHORUS [sung after verse 3 only]
Mighty Land, mighty Land, mighty Land, my native Land! 
Columbia, Columbia, Columbia, my native Land!

2. 
Curst by the cause with blood and strife, 
Native Land, my native Land, 
Wither the arm, and waste the life; 
Blood-bought Land, my native Land! 
Beneath thine eyes of scornful flame, 
That dares to lift the brand of shame 
Against the glory of thy of thy name,

3. 
With bared right arm and burning heart, 
Glorious  Land, my native Land, 
From their old graves thy heroes start, 
Bleeding Land, my native Land! 
Where’re thy starry standard flies 
Embattled legions shake the skies, 
With thunder-fronted victories,

4. 
Far as the golden-fruited years, 
Sunny Land, my native Land, 
Roll thro’ the summer’s purple spheres, 
Smiling Land, my native Land! 
Thy sacred shore shall be the shrine, 
By pilgrim ages made divine 
With offerings of blood and wine!
