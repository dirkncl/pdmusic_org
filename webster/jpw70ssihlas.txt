1. She shines in honor like a star,
  That glows serene thro’ muddy skies,
And sends a shining trail afar
  On all the troubled waves that rise;
By that mild light my life I steer,—
  As some lone pilot on the deep
Knows, by one star, his harbor near,
  And safely on his course may keep.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[with overlapping voices]
[SA]
She shines in honor like a star,
  That glows serene thro’ murky skies,
And sends a shining trail afar
  On all the troubled waves that rise.
[TB]
She shines, she shines in honor like a star, like a star,
  That glows, that glows serene thro’ murky skies, murky skies,
And sends, and sends a shining trail afar, trail afar
  On all the troubled, troubled waves that rise.


2. She shines in honor like the day,
  Serenely just, and calmly bright;
And all things evil shrink away
  From her pure presence, as from light:
And, white as winter’s virgin fleece,
  In innocence her spirits move:
The atmosphere she breathes is peace;
  And all her steps are ruled by love.

3. She shines in honor like the brave
  Made white by an heroic death,
Whose glorirous deeds survive the grave,
  And live in fame’s exulting breath:
So pure, so tender and so bright,
  No trembling chill, to blush or frown,—
Her virture glows with mellow light,
  Mild and secure as old renown.
