1. 
I knew by the light of his deep dark eye,
When he heard the roll of the must’ring drum,
That he never would fold his arms, and sigh
Over the evils that were to come;
I knew that the blood of a patriot sire,
Coursed thro’ his veins like a stream of fire,
So I took his hand and bade him go,
But he never dreamed that it grieved me so.

2. 
Two fair hair’d babes he left for me,
Who lisp his name at even tide—
The very hour, when on his knee
He used to fondle his pet and pride.
Alas! they may never again be blest,
With a father's care in his old home rest;
And he never again may hear the tones,
Or kiss the lips of his little ones.

3. 
I know he has gone to his country’s call,
That his breast is bared to a high command;
But my heart will break I know if he fall
In the battle front, by a traitor’s hand;
Yet I murmer not tho’ my tearwet eyes
Attest the worth of the sacrifice;
’Tis a wife’s free gift,— two lives in one,
In the name of GOD and Washington.

4. 
Perhaps when the maple leaves turn red,
And the golden glories of the harvest, come,
I shall wake some morning and hear his tread
And give him a warm heart’s welcome
To kneel with him in fervent prayer,
Thanking our GOD for his watchful care,
In shielding his heart from the rebel band,
Who honor’d the flag of his cherish’d laid.
