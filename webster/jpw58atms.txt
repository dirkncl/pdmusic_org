[N. B. The fourth verse was handwritten in an unknown hand; 
however, it was included in the original sheet music copy from
Webster's home music library, and can thus can reasonably be
assumed to be either written by Dyer or Webster.] 

1. Though they may lay beneath the ground
The form of Allie dear, 
I know his spirit hovers round, 
And mingles with us here. 
His home may be in heaven above; 
Yet oft to us below 
He will return to breathe his love,- 
For the angels told me so.

2. His form reposed upon the bier 
In sweet cherubic rest, 
When others come to shed the tear, 
And ease the aching breast; 
But Willie felt no throbbing pain, 
As he repeats, "I know 
Dear Allie will come back again,- 
For the angels told me so."

3. And as he gazed his eyes grew bright,
And joy o'erspread his brow,
As he exclaims, in rapt delight,
"O, there is Allie now!
I knew he would return to see
Those he so loved below,
And be a brother still to me,-
For the angels told me so!"

[Handwitten Verse]
4. Oh the dear and happy moments
That will never more return,
Tho' they're gone alas forever,
We will not forever morn.
There's a better world beyond us
Thus a better life to come.
Let's be happy while [we live it?]
For this world is still our home.
