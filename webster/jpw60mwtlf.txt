1. Mother, watch the little feet
Climbing o’er the garden wall,
Bounding through the busy street,
Ranging cellar, shed and hall;
Never count the moments lost,
Never mind the time it cost,
Little feet will go asstray,—
Guide them, mother, while you may.

SATB CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[for S,A,T]
Mother, watch those happy children,
Watch, and bless them, while you may;
Childhood’s dear and happy hours
Are passing fast away.
[for B only]
Mother, watch those happy children,
Watch, and bless them, while you may;
Father dear and happy hours of childhood,
For these dear and happy hours
will soon forever pass away.

2. Mother, watch the little hand
Picking berries by the way,
Making houses in the sand,
Tossing on the fragrant hay.
Never dare the question ask,
“Why to me this weary task?”
These same little hands may prove
Messengers of light and love.

3. Mother, watch the little tongue
Prattling, eloquent and wild;
What is said and what is sung
By the happy, joyous child.
Catch the word while yet unspoken,
Stop the vow before tis broken!
This same tongue may yet proclaim
Blessings in a Saviour’s name.

4. Mother, watch the little heart
Beating soft and warm for you;
Wholesome lessons now impart,—
Keep; oh keep that young heart true;
Estricating ev’ry weed,
Sowing good and precious seed;
Harvest rich you then may see,
Ripening for eternity.
