1. On Jordan’s strand we’re waiting
To take our passage o’er!
Though high the waves are breaking,
Fear not! we’ll reach the shore!
Our loving Lord hath promised
For those who follow Him,
To his eternal city,
A happy entrance in.

CNORUS [sung after each verse]
We will cross over Jordan!
We will cross over Jordan!
We will cross over Jordan!
To Canaan’s happy land!
We will cross over Jordan!
We will cross over Jordan!
We will cross over Jordan!
To Canaan’s happy land!

2. By Jordan’s strand the waters
Are flowing dark and cold,
But Christ will guide us over,
And help us as of old!
The golden Land of Promise
Is lying just before,
And faith almost discloses
The glory of that shore!

3. If life is dull and dreary,
And full of toil and care,
If often we are weary,
And heavy burdens bear,
Our hope or spirits cheering,
Shall bless us evermore—
The Land of Rest is nearing!
We almost see the shore!

4. Come brother! come my sister!
And walk the way with me,
To Jordan’s stormy water
Which shuts that land from thee!
For God will shortly call thee,
And lead with gentle hand
Across the rolling billows,
Unto the Promised Land!
