1. Softly blow sweet scented zephyr,
  Round the grave where Jennie lies;
Gently waft ye waving breezes,
  Daylight’s glory from the skies.
Drink pale flower, drink the dew drops,
  Twilight sprinkles round her rest,
Night winds lower o’er my Jennie,
  O’er my Jennie doubly blest.

2. Dark and lonely is her dwelling,
  Like a star among the clouds;
Yes her spirit never waning,
  Wingeth to the bright abodes.
There sweet idol, there I’ll join you,
  When my night of toil is o’er;
There we’ll dwell in holy rapture,
  Singing praises evermore.
