1. Happy Land! To thee I’m going,
Where the skies are evver bright,
Where the crystal streams are flowing,
And the hills are bathed on light!
Happy Land! Happy Land! 
Happy Land! Happy Land! 
Where the crystal streams are flowing,
And the hills are bathed on light!


2. Love eteral, like a river,
Waters all that happy land!
God the Author, God the Giver,
Rules it with a gentle hand!
Happy Land! Happy Land!
Happy Land! Happy Land!
God the Author, God the Giver,
Rules it with a gentle hand!

3. Flowers immortal there are growing
In the heavenly land of rest,
And the Saviour, love bestowing,
Fills with peace the wearied breast.
Happy Land! Happy Land!
Happy Land! Happy Land!
And the Saviour, love bestowing,
Fills with peace the wearied breast.

4. Sweet the songs we’ll sing together,
When we reach that blessed shore,
Walking in the light forever,
Knowing earthly sin no more.
Happy Land! Happy Land!
Happy Land! Happy Land!
Walking in the light forever,
Knowing earthly sin no more!
