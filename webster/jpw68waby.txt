1. We are but young, yet we can wield
The sword of truth in life's broad field,
So gird we armor ev'ry one,
To aid the work that must be done.
No hand so small that may not sow
The seed of love and truth below;
No little child has voice so weak
That words of goodness may not speak.

2. We've joined the Army of the Lord,
And, guided by His precious word,
Walk even in the narrow way,
That leadeth into perfect day.
While Jesus Christ our leader is
We will obey each word of His,
And follow where he leadeth on,
Until the fight of faith is won.
