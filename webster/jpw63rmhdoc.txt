1. Away o’er mem’rys cloudless track
Oh! how I love to roam;
Where life’s young morn so bright and fair
Fell on my childhood’s home,
Where rosy hearts would spring from sleep
With plumage bathed in dew,
And lift their wings in joyous song
Upon the welkin blue.

2. The eglantine all loving crept
In fragrance o’er the door;
And laughing sunbeams sported there
Upon the ashen floor.
How happy ’neath its roof so low,
Were pass’d those halcyon days;
How gaily joined the forest birds
In young life’s rouudelays.

3. And on the lawn so fresh and green
I’ve many an hour beguiled,
With skipping rope and trundling hoop
A happy sportive child.
In thought I roam the orchard path,
Where golden fruits hang low;
And o'er me seems to shine once more
The light of long ago.

4. And now I see the grapevine hang,
From off the garden wall,
The deep rich clusters tempting swing,
Or in the basket fall.
And sound of voices, full of glee,
Come on my list’ning ear;
And now I hear my mother’s voice
In music soft and clear.

5. She sweetly sings a song of old,
And oh! a smile so sweet
E’er rests upon my mother’s face
Which mem’ry loves to greet.
Those brightest hours  have long since fled,
But oh! there is a thrill—
A joyous thought, as fancy brings
That cottage ’neath the hill.
