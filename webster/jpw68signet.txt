(from "The Signet Ring" pp. 3-4)
Words and Music
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Take my heart and seal it, Lord,
With the signet of thy love!
Let thy truth be stamped ther-on,
Stains of sin, O Lord remove!
Life the Signet Ring of truth,
Let thy grace around me shine,
Teaching me to render up
All the praise that should be thine.

REFRAIN
Take my heart, Oh! Lord and seal it,
Seal it Lord, forever thine;
Love is thine, O Lord reveal it
To this asking heart of mine!

2.
Take my heart and tune it, Lord,
All thy wondrous love to sing,
Of-rings glad of sacred song!
To thy throne of grace to bring!
Voice and heart to sweet accord
With the music of the skies,
Daily may my heart's free gift
On the wings of faith arise!

(REFRAIN)

3.
Truthful beat my youthful heart,
In its sacred love for thee!
Truthful keep my youthful lips,
Truthful let my actions be!
Seal me with thy signet, Lord,
Let my heart with truth be sealed!
Let in me the perfect work
Of thy mercy be revealed,

(REFRAIN)
