1.
Life is fleeting, life is fleeting!
Happy hours must pass away.
E'ry morning has its eve'ning;
Darkness closest brightest day;
Let us labor, let us labor,
While the light and sunshine last,
Wrestling from the hour its favor,
Working ere the day past.

2.
Life is fleeting, life is fleeting!
Let us labor with a will!
Full of hope our hearts are beating,
Honor's measure we may fill;
Working makes our spirit brightest,
And our lives more noble, grand,
And it makes life's burderns lighter,
Working with the heart and hand.

3.
Life is fleeting, life is fleeting!
Let us do what good we can,
Have for all a kindly greeting,
In love's army lead the van,
Hoping ev'ry seed that falleth
May grow up in flowers of love,
Till the gracious master calleth
All his children home above.
