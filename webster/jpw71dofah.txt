1. 
I meet with kind friends dear to me, 
Wheree’er I chance to roam, 
But dearer dearer still are they, 
Those dear old friends, 
Those dear old friends at home; 
Their counsels ev  er guide my steps   
Along life’s troubled way 
And tho’ far distant from them now 
I heed sweet mem’ry’s lay, 
And tho’ far distant from them now 
I heed sweet mem’ry’s lay.

2. 
I see their smiles in visions bright, 
So gentle and so kind, 
And hear again the dear old songs, 
Which mem’ry brings, 
Which mem’ry brings to mind; 
I kneel with them at eventide, 
When thickly shadows come, 
And pray for all those absent from 
The dear old friends  at home, 
And pray for all those absent from 
The dear old friends at home.

3. 
Ere life’s brief journey shall be o’er, 
I hope to meet them all, 
To join the household band again, 
And bygone scenes, 
And bygone scenes recall; 
But if death’s hand should softly fall 
Upon me as I roam, 
May love ones lay me down to rest 
Near by the friends at home, 
May loved ones lay me down to rest 
Near by the friends at home.
