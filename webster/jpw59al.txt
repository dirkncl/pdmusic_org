1. Softly steals the evening shadow 
Down the meadow by the hill; 
Softly sleeps the mellow moonlight 
On the wavelets near the mill; 
O’er my voiceful leaves in music 
Murmer soft her name to me, 
Whom adown death’s silent river, 
Angels wooed away from me. 

CHORUS 1
Allie Lennon, Allie Lennon, 
Whom the angels wooed from me; 
Allie Lennon, Allie Lennon, 
Whom the angels wooed from me.

2. Twice has Spring her leaves and flowers 
Hung in garlands on this tree, 
Since the envious stars beheld her 
Seated there at eve with me; 
Now they kiss a carved marble, 
Pure and white as drifted snow; 
And above a mound low drooping 
Violets and lilies grow! 

CHORUS 2
Allie Lennon, Allie Lennon, 
Sleepeth where those lilies blow; 
Allie Lennon, Allie Lennon, 
Sleepeth where those lilies blow.
