1. 
Oh, fallen hero, noble friend,
’Tis not the friend I mourn in thee,
Though called, in nid career to end
Thy shining course of victory,
I dare not grieve for friendship’s sake,
To know thy soldier’s knell is rung—
That shame or glory ne’er shall wake
The silver trumpet of thy tongue.

2. 
That dim the eye whose lightning seared
The traitor, through his brazen mail;
That lips, whose smile of sweetness cheered
Our darkest day are cold and pale.
No selfish sorrow fits thee now,
And we who loved thee stand aside
While she our Mother, veils her brow,
And in her grief forgets her pride.

3. 
When half the stars of honor fade
That gemmed her banner’s morning sky,
She sees them triumph, who betrayed,
And he, their truest chieftan, die!
Now when ambition rules the land,
And patriots play the traitor’s part,
We ill can spare his open hand,
We ill can spare his honest heart. 

4. 
When timid lips proclaim their doubt,
To chill the ardor of the brave,
We miss his dauntles battle shout,
That never truce to treason gave.
When Freedom’s base apostles preach
Dishonor in the sacred name
Of peace his grand indignant speech
No more shall smite the cowering shame! 

5. 
Oh, fallen hero, noble friend,
’Tis not the friend, I mourn in thee,
Though called in mid career to end
Thy shining course of victory.
God! Thou hast sheathed the sword he drew;
We bow before Thy dark decree:
But give the the arms that build anew
Our Nation’s temple, strength from Thee!
