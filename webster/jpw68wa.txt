1. Work away, work away,
Work in earnest every day!
For the good, for the true,
You must up and do!
When the ills of life you meet,
Face the storm with willing feet,
Marching on, marching on,
Till the prize is won.

2. Work away, work away,
And with earnest spirit pray
For the light, for the light,
Guiding all aright.
He will ev’ry step attend,
Who on earth the children’s friend
Came to be, came to be,
Bringing mercy free.

3. Work away, work away,
Work is better far than play,
When it brings, when it brings,
Good from meanest things.
And you life will then accord
With the precepts of the Lord,
Who can find, who can find,
Work for all mankind.

4. Work away, work away,
Comrades till the better day
Usher in, usher in,
Blessing and no sin.
Then dear children hand in hand,
We will walk the blessed strand,
Singing praise, singing praise,
Through eternal days.
