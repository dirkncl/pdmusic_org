[Boys]
1. Why sing the birds so merrily
When spring-tide comes?
Why through the scale so cheerily
Their their music runs?
[Girls]
The birds are thankful, and they sing
Because their hearts are glad,
In praise of Him who brings the spring,
All leaf and flower clad.

[Boys]
2. The children, too, sing merrily,
And why they sing,
Than even birds more cheerily,
At opening day?
[Girls]
Each child is thankful, and they sing
Because their hearts are glad,
In praise to Him who brings the spring,
All leaf and flower clad.

[Boys]
3. Why sing we all so merrily,
This gladsome time,
Our voices making harmony
Almost divine?
[Gilrs]
We all are thankful, and we sing
Because our hearts are glad,
In praise of Him who brings the spring,
All leaf and flower clad.
