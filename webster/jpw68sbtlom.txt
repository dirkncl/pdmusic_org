1.
Softly breaks the light of Morning,
Tinting all the eastern sky,
With a glorious crown adorning
Stately tree and hilltop high,
Waking cheerful songs of pleasure
Through the vale and leafy grove,
Where the birds in tuneful measure,
Warble out their notes of love.

2.
Let us join the birds in singing,
For our hearts are thankful too,
And there is a joy in bringing
Gifts of song from spirits true,
To the Lord who watches o'er us
With a kind and loving care,
Making all the world before us
Bright as morning blushes are.
