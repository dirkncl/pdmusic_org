1. Death has torn her from my bosom,
One I loved so well;
Oh how dark the world will be now
Without Hattie Bell.
When the summer winds are sighing
Through a lonely dell,
They have lain my spirit’s idol,
Dearest Hattie Bell.

CHORUS 1 [overlapping voices]
[SA]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
They have lain my spirit’s idol,
Dearest Hattie Bell!
[TB]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
When the summer winds are sighing
Thro’ a lonely dell,
They have lain my spirit’s idol,
Dearest Hattie Bell!

2. Gloom is ’round the little cottage
Where she used to dwell;
Ev’ry leaflet seems to whisper,
Where is Hattie Bell?
Down amongst the twilight shadows,
In a lonely dell,
Sweetly bloom the wildwood flowers
Over Hattie Bell.

CHORUS 2 [overlapping voices]
[SA]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Sweetly bloom the wildwood flowers
Over Hattie Bell.
[TB]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Down amongst the twilight shadows,
In a lonely dell,
Sweetly bloom the wildwood flowers
Over Hattie Bell.

3. Underneath the weeping willow,
By the river side,
I am waiting where we parted,
For my angel bride.
And the winds that now are sighing
Through that lonely dell,
Tell me that I soon shall slumber
With my Hattie Bell.

CHORUS 3
[SA]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Tell me that I soon shall slumber
With my Hattie Bell.
[TB]
Dearest Hattie Bell!
Dearest Hattie Bell!
And the winds that now are sighing
Through that lonely dell,
Tell me that I soon shall slumber
With my Hattie Bell.
