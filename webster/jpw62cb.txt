In this fearful struggle between North and South
there are hundreds of cases in which fathers are
arrayed against sons, and brothers against brothers.

[1.]
“Now Rifleman, shoot me a rare fancy shot 
And straight at the heart of that prowling vidette; 
Ring me a ball in that glittering spot 
That so shines on his breast like a bright amulet! 
Ah, Captain! here goes like a finely drawn head, 
There’s music around when my barrel’s in tune!” 
Then crack went the rifle the messenger sped, 
And dead from his horse fell the ranging dragoon. 

[2.] 
Now Rifleman, steal thro’ the bushes and snatch 
From your victim some trinket to handsel first blood, 
A button, a loop, or that luminous patch, 
That gleams in the moon like a brilliant diamond stud. 

[3.] 
Oh! Captain! I staggered and sunk on my track, 
When I gazed on the face of the fallen vidette, 
For he looked so like you as he lay on his back, 
That my heart rose upon me and masters me yet. 
But I snatched off the trinket— this locket of gold 
An inch from the center my lead broke its way, 
Scarce grazing the picture, so fair to behold, 
Of a beautiful lady in bridal array. 
Of a beautiful lady in bridal array. 

[4.] 
Ha! Rifleman, fling me the locket! ’tis she, 
My brother6s young bride— and the fallen dragoon 
Was her husband! hush! soldier, ’twas heaven’s decree; 
We must bury him there, by the light of the moon! 

[5.] 
But, hark! the far bugles their warnings unite; 
War is a virtue— and weakness a sin; 
There’s a lurking and loping around us tonight; 
Load again, Rifleman; keep your hand in!
