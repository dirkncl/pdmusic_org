1. Sit down by my side as of old, Mary dear;
  I will leave you in sorrow no more.
And want that has preyed on your cheek, Mary dear,
  Shall never return to our door.
I know I’ve been wrong, very wrong, Mary dear,
  In tarrying long at the wine,
But help me to mend if you can Mary dear,
  For no loving can save me but thine.

2. You know I was kind in the past, Mary dear,
  Ere drinking had made me insane,
And never in those happy days, Mary dear,
  Your pleadings were uttered in vain;
God helping, the light of those days, Mary dear,
  Shall shine on your pathway again,
And happines gladden your heart, Mary dear,
  As fully and truly as then.

3. I know of the nights you have watched, Mary dear,
  And cared for the children alone,
While I have been away with drink, Mary dear,
  Forgetting the blessings of home.
I’ll watch by your side from this hour, Mary dear,
  I’ll share ev’ry sorrow and pain,
And make you believe that your love, Mary dear,
  Has not all been wasted in vain.

4. Forgive me for wronging your love, Mary dear,
  And bringing the children to shame;
I’ll try and atone for the past, Mary dear,
  And wash out its record of blame,
Do you think they will love me again, Mary dear,
  And watch for my coming at eve,
And be glad when I smile at their ways, Mary dear,
  And be sad in their love when I grieve?

5. In the lone little yard by the church, Mary dear,
  Sweet Willie is taking his rest;
We think of his dear absent face, Mary dear,
  Forgetting our baby is blest;
Yet how can I smother the wish, Mary dear,
  That he might be with us tonight,
And witness the promise I make, Mary dear,
  To try once again to do right?

6. The teardrops are wetting your cheeks, Mary dear,
  Let me kiss them away as of old,
When tears, if they fell from your eyes, Mary dear,
  Were glad ones, and precious as gold.
The lovelight that gleamed in your eyes, Mary dear,
  In the hours of the glad long ago,
Beams tenderly now on my face, Mary dear,
  And I am forgiven I know.
