1. When I lie dreaming,—
  Dreaming, sweet love, of thee,—
Pain is not seeming,
  Nor happy life a thing that cannot be;
Fair freedom is not far
  From all the things that are,
A wild, bright, mocking star,
  Through distant gleaming:
Love rules the earth and sky,
  And heaven is nearer by,
When I lie dreaming,

When I lie dreaming.
  Love rules the earth and sky,
And heav’n is nearer by,
  When I lie dreaming, nearer by,


2. When I lie dreaming,—
  Dreaming of joy past speech,—
Faith, sweetly beaming,
  Brings perfect peace within our human reach;
And earth is vexed no more
  With greed, and lies, and war,
Love heals the sick and sore,
  With pity beaming;
The new earth, clad in day,
  Rolls freedom’s radiant way,
While I lie dreaming.

While I lie dreaming.
The new earth, clad in day,
  Rolls freedom’s radiant way,
While I lie dreaming.

3. When I lie dreaming,—
  Dreaming of thee, my best,—
There is no scheming
  Nor aching heart in any mortal breast;
For the world mirrors thee,—
  Pure, guileless, loving, free,
And wise as truth may be
  In beauty beaming,
For my soul’s yearning arms
  Clasp nothing but thy shame,
When I lie dreaming.

When I lie dreaming,
  For my soul’s yearning arms
Clasp nothing but thy shame,
  When I lie dreaming.
