1.
An Elm tree of old stood lonely and cold, 
Where wintry winds blew high; 
And looking below he saw in the snow: 
The Ivy wand’ring nigh. 
And he said come twine with those tendrils of thine 
My scathed and frozen form, 
For heart and hand together we’ll stand; 
And mock at the baffled storm, 

[CHORUS repeat after each verse]
Ha ha! together we are bold and strong, 
together we are right when the world goes wrong; 
Ha ha together we will live and die 
Ha ha still together when the ocean’s dry. 

2.
And so when grief is with’r ring the leaf 
And checking hopes young flow’r 
And frosts do bite with their teeth so white 
In sorrow's lonely hour. 
Tho’ it might o’erwhelm either Ivy or Elm, 
If alone each stood the strife, 
But heart and hand together we’ll stand; 
And laugh at the troubles of life.
