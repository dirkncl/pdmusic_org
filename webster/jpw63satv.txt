An old and crippled veteran to the War Department came,
He sought the Chief who led him, on many a field of fame--
The Chief who shouted "Forward!" where e'er his banner rose,
And bore its stars in triumph behind the flying foes.
"Have you forgotten, General," the battered soldier cried
The days of eighteen hundred twelve, when I was at your side?
Have you forgotten Johnson, that fought at Lundy's Land?
'Tis true I'm old and pensioned, but I want to fight again.
