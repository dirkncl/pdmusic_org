1. A wailing sound doth haunt the winds tonight,
  And blackest clouds shut out the silver stars,
That else had shone on earth so chilly white,
  Like the cold clay upon the coffin’d bier,
    Under the snow, under the snow.

2. The woodbine tops upon the window pane,
  When the low moaning voice sweeps ling’ring by;
I listen for a voice I shall now hear again,
  From lips that mute within the church yard lie,
    Under the snow, under the snow.

3. I think in sorrow of that grave they made.
  On the green hill side where the woods gave sear;
And the pale face that from our sight they laid,
  That now lies sleeping in the midnight drear,
    Under the snow, under the snow.

4. And yet I know he cannot hear the blast,
  That blows so chilly over his low bed;
Cold is the bosom that has throbbed its last,
  And grave yard dust lies on the lily lids—
    Under the snow, under the snow.

5. Under the snow how many a hope is laid,
  And hearts beat faster in this winter night,
Thinking of graves that only late were made,
  Now shrouded up in chilly, chlly white
    Under the snow, under the snow.

6. Earth’s fairest flowers black with frost lie low,
  Covered with mold and dark, and damp decay;
The summer brook hushed in its fairy flow,
  Sleeping in the darkness with our flowers that lay
    Under the snow, under the snow.
