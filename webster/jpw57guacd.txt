"Going Up & Coming Down" (1857)
Ballad.
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875
from "Prairie Flowers", No. 2

[Allegretto.]
1.
This is a simple song, 'tis true
  And songs like this are never nice;
And yet we'll try and scatter through
  A pinch or two of good advice.
Then listen pompous friend and learn
  Never to boast of much renown;
For fortune's wheel is on the turn,
  And some go up, and some come down.
For forune's wheel is on the turn,
  And some go up, and some come down.

2.
We know a vast amount of stocks
  A vast amount of pride insurance
But it has picked so many [?]
  We wouldn't like to warrant yours.
Remember, then, and never spurn
  The one whose hand is hard and brown;
For he is likely to go up,
  And you are likely to come down,
For he is likely to go up,
  And you are likely to come down.

3.
Another thing you will agree,
  The truth may be as well confessed,
That "Codfish Aristocracy"
  Is but a _scaly_ thing at best;
And though the fishes large and strong
  May seek the little ones to drown,
Yet fishes all both large and small,
  Are going up and coming down.

4.
Our lives are full of chance and change,
  And _chance_, you know, is neversure;
And 'twere a doctrine new and strange
  That places high are most secure,
And though the fickle god may smile,
  And yield the sceptre and the crown,
'Tis only for a little while;
  Then B goes up and A comes down.

5.
This world for you and me, my friend,
  Hath something more than pounds and pence;
Then let me humbly recommend
  A little use of common sense.
Thus lay all pride of place aside,
  And have a care on when you frown,
For fear you'll see him going up,
  When you are only coming down.
