1. Hark! the voice of Mary, bending from the skies—
See the deepened azure, borrowed from her eyes—
There she standeth waiting at the golden dome,
WIth her arms entwining those who went before!
  O! the voice of Mary linger with us yet;—
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!

2. Sleeping on her pillow, sweetly Mary lay,
When the angels whispered— Sister, come away!
Timidly she lifted those ever loving eyes,
For the angel presence filled her with surprise.
  O, the thought of Mary lingers with us yet;—
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!

3. Angels at the portals beckoned Mary in,
Through the crystal river cleansing all her sin;
Robed her there in garmets whiter far than snow,
Gems forev’ry virtue sparkling in their glow.
  O, the love of Mary lingers with us yet,—
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!
  Who that’s loved a Mary ever can forget!

4. We yet list and linger ’neath the blue above,
For her voice of music, for her eyes of love;
Envy we the angels who enticed away,
Mary, gentle sunbeam, from our earthly day.
  But her soul of music hovers o’er us yet,—
  We our angel Mary never can forget!
  We our angel Mary never can forget!
