1. Thank God for the sunshine that blesses us all,
Dispensing its beams on the great and the small,
Reviving and cheering like infinte love,
That shines from the throne of the Father above!

2. It calls in the springtime, the flowers to life,
And makes ev'ry hillside with blossoming rife;
It carpets the meadow in emerald sheen,
And dresses the hills in their vesture of green.

3. It loads the glad air with the hum of the bees,
And festoons with emerald jewels the trees;
It makes kind and thankful the flocks and the herds,
And fills all the land with the music of birds.

4. Thank God for the sunshine that cheers us today,
With glory and beauty surrounding our way,
So may He surround us from heaven above,
With sunshine of mercy and infinite love.
