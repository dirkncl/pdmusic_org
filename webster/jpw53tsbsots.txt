"The Sailor Boy's Song of the Sea" (1853)
from "Songs and Quartettes of the Alleghanians", No. 1
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Oh! the sea the sea
is the place for me,
With its billows blue and bright;
I love its roar as it breaks on the shore
And its danger to me is delight.

CHORUS
Then hurra
Then hurra for the brave.
For the ever ever free,
For the ever ever free,
Hurra for the Glorious sea.

2.
I love the wave
And the sailor brave,
Who often meets his dream:
Oh the ocean vast he sleeps his last
In a shell or coral tomb.

(CHORUS)

3.
And oh in the night,
When the moon's soft light;
Smiles sweet on the sparkling wave,
And many a star as it twinkles afar,
Seems to rise from a wat'ry grave.

(CHORUS)

4.
When life is o're
And I sail no more,
O're the ocean I cease to roam,
Safe down below 'mid the coral of snow,
May the sailor boy find a home.

(CHORUS)
