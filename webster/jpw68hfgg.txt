Dedicated to the Convention that nominated
General Grant for the presidency at

"Hurrah for General Grant!" (1867)
Words by Luke Collin
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Hurrah! Hurrah! the Boys in Blue
Are coming in their might.
In solid columns firm and true,
To ballot for the Right:
Brave boys are they, and well they know,
The country's chief, mid want.
The air resounds, where-e'er they go,
With cheers for Gen'ral Grant.

CHORUS
Hurrah! Hurrah! mislead the Boys you can't;
Forever true they wave the Blue and followed Gen'ral Grant.
Hurrah! Hurrah! deceive them now you can't;
The Boys in Blue forever true, will vote for Gen'ral Grant.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!!!

2.
When sorely? pressed, in time of war --
Its spirit burried with grief --
The Nation sought both near and far
For means of quick relief;
Of men and money, ships and guns,
We had the best extant;
But win the efforts of our sons,
Till led by Gen'ral Grant.

3.
The People! they are moving too!
From hilly rockbound Maine.
The ball is rolling through and through
To farthest western plain.
No boasting now of Southern rights --
No Puritanic rant,
North, South, East, West -- the world unites
In praise of Gen'ral Grant.

4.
All hail! the chief -- the people's choice;
His name is Nation's shield!
Who now obeys the common voice
As when he took the field.
Our cause is just; our banner bright
Oh Freedom's hills we plant;
Our cry shall be, GOD SPEED THE RIGHT --
HURRAY! FOR GEN'RAL GRANT.
