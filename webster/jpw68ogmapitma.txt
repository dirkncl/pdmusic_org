1. O give me a place in the mansions above--
The work of Our Father, the gift of His love!
'Tis crowned with the glory that shines from His throne,
Awaiting the time when his children come home.

2. The angels are waiting to welcome us there;
They weave the bright crowns that our spirits shall wear;
And, when we are freee from the earth and its sin,
The songs they are singing shall welcome us in.

3. O Father in Heaven, be near us each day,
And guide our young feet in love's beautiful way!
O lead to the land that is blessed by Thy love,
And crown us with joy in the mansions above!
