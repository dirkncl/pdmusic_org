1.
Oh be kind to one another,
Children all, children all,
Be it sister, be it brother,
Love them all, love them all,
Gentle words and loving glances
Lighten even life's mischances,
Love each bliss of life enhances;
Be kind, be kind to all.

2.
Oh be kind to one another,
Children all, children all,
Be it sister, be it brother,
Love them all, love them all,
Choosing good is best of choices
Kindness ev'ry heart rejoices,
Full of music are your voices
When kind accents fall.

3.
Oh be kind to one another,
Children all, children all,
Be it sister, be it brother,
Love them all, love them all,
Kindly acts are richest treasure,
Bringing loving without measure,
Filling all you hearts with pleasure;
Kindly be to all.
