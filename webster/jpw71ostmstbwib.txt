"Oh Say to My Spirit Thy Bride Will I Be" (10 Feb 1871)
Song and Chorus.
Words by C. Ernst Fahnestock.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875.

1.
Though far from thy presence,
An exile I rove,
My heart to thee trembles,
The star of my love;
And wherever my pathway,
Through forest or glen,
A halo encircles
Our meeting again,
A halo encircles
Our meeting again.

CHORUS
The stars of the Heaven,
Have brides on the sea,
Oh say to my spirit,
Thy bride will I be,
Oh say to my spirit,
Thy bride will I be.

2.
The blossoms and sunshine
Are dearer to me,
Because of their daily
Communion with thee;
Like the music of fountains,
Or warbling of birds,
Is the delicate flow
Of thine eloquent words,
Is the delicate flow
Of thine eloquent words.

(CHORUS)

3.
My soul is a mirror,
Where fondly I trace,
The smiles, that illumine
Thy beautiful face.
For the thoughts of thy bosom
Were born in the skies,
And angels might covet
The wealth of thine eyes,
And angels might covet
The wealth of thine eyes.

(CHORUS)
