1. Oh scorn not thy brother
  ’Tho poor he may be,
He’s bound to another,
  A bright world with thee.
Should sorrow assail him
  Give heed to his sighs,
Should strength ever fail him,
  Oh! help him to rise.

2. The pathway we’re roaming
  ’Mid flowers may lie,
But soon will life’s gloaming,
  Come darkning our sky;
Then seek not to smother
  Kind feelings in thee,
Oh scorn not thy brother,
  Tho’ poor he may be.

3. Go cheer those who languish
  Their dead hopes among,
In whose hearts stearn anguish,
  Their harps have unstrung;
They may soon in another
  Bright land roam with thee,
Then scorn not thy brother,
  Tho’ poor he may be.
