1.
The Lord hath redeemed and preserved us a nation;
Hath healed all our wounds with the balm of salvation;
The pillar of fire he hath lighted before us,
And builded the cloud like a canopy o'er us.

CHORUS
Hallelujah to the Lord! (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah amen. (halle, hallelujah to the Lord,)
hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah, amen,
Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah, amen.

2.
He cleft the Red sea of our civil commotion;
He turned back the wave of the War's crimson hued ocean;
Like Israel of old, in the desert he fed us,
And safe out of bondage his mercy led us.

(CHORUS)

3.
Then glory to God who hath blessed what was founded
In labor and yearning and peril unbounded
And willed that we keep what the fathers confided---
A banner unstained, and a state undivided.

(CHORUS)
