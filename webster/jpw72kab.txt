1. As Kitty was walking one morning so early,
When over the meadows came whistling Ben
She lifted her head with its brown hair so curly,
And what do you think pretty Kitty did then?
Why out of her eye came glances so shy,
Coquetted with Ben as he slowly pass’d by.
He lifted his cap, his heart beating the while,
And greeted her thus with a bow and a smile.

2. Good morning Miss Kitty, ’tis airly yer walkin’,
The sun is outhrivaled indade be yer eyes!
“’Tis you that can flather have done with yer talkin’
And tind to yer whistling!” sweet Kitty replied.
“Mavourneen!” said he— “Be aisy!” said she—
Indade if you’ll let me— I will that,” said he.
She toss’d he bright head and ne’er deign’d him a glance.
Thought he, “oh! for wooing, I’ve mighty small chance!”

3. But out on the meadow that morning so early
He ceased not from teasing— and Kitty gave in.
“’Tis only to kape ye from being so surly,”
Said she, “tho’ I vow in my heart it’s a sin.
For some time ago, believe it of me,
I yielded my heart to a good looking beau.
I vow’d in my soul that to him I’d be thrue
And why shoul I break that same vow sir with You?”

4. Bedad thin, Mavourneed, that vow I’ll not hinder.
I don’t won’t the heart that is not all my own!
But I will be bound he will not be more tender
Than I, tho’ yer sending me off sad and lone!”
”Come back Ben!” said she— “What for thin,” said he.
“Because I meant you all the time sir,” said she.
“Then here goes a kiss for the bargain” he cries.
“Tho’ I know ye meant me by the look in yer eyes!"
