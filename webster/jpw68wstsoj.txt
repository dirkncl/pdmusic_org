1.
We sing the song of Jesus,
With happy heart and voice!
Come join our tuneful numbers,
With us may you rejoice!

CHORUS 2 times
We sing, (we sing,) we sing, (we sing,)
we sing, the song of Jesus,
We sing, (we sing,) we sing, (we sing,)
we sing, the song of love.

2.
For us the Savior suffered,
For us the Savior died,
And healing streams of mercy
Flowed from his wounded side.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
For he waits in glory,
Upon the further shore,
Where sin and all transgression
Shall live and harm no more.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
We know our upward journey
Is only just begun,
But fear not tell toil or danger
While Jesus leads us on.

(CHORUS 2 times)

5.
Come wait, with us the pathway
That leads unto the skies,
And let your tuneful voices
With ours in anthems rise.

(CHORUS 2 times)
