1. When the ties of earth are parted,
  And the soul, revealed and known,
Lonely here, or broken hearted,
  Finds, at last, and claims its own,
There, where love, in full completeness,
  Free from jealousy and pride,
Fills the eternal life with sweetness,
  I shall meet my angel bride,
  I shall meet my angel bride.

2. Here, O love! thy tender story,
  Sways with incomplete control.
What shall be thy perfect glory,
  There, where soul is blent with soul,
To one radiant being blended,
  From earth’s falsehood purified?
When my loneliness is ended,
  Who shall be my angel bride?
  Who shall be my angel bride?

3. Dreams of sweet, etherial splendor,
  Floating thro’ the poet’s brain.
Visioned loves, devoutly tender,
  Do ye haunt our souls in vain?
Is there somewhere perfect union,
  Crown’d with peace, and glorified,
Where to sweet, supreme communion,
  I shall clasp my angel bride,
  I shall clasp my angel bride?

4. Is there love unmix’d with sorrow,
  Life without the ills of this,
Peaceful, pointless, each tomorrow
  Fall of undiminished bliss,
Where, in joy’s eternal haven,
  Beauty, Faith and Love abide?
And, when I attain this heaven,
  Who shall be my angel bride,
  Who shall be my angel bride?
