"Evelyn" (1872)
Song
Words by Sanford Fillmore Bennett, 1836-1898
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
One morning in Heaven the angels
Kept watch on the bright golden shore,
For a herald had come at the even
And this was the message she bore ...
"Sweet Evelyn waiteth to welcome
The angels to bear her away ...
From the storms and the darkness of earth life
To the beatiful mansions of day."

CHORUS
There was welcome sweet welcome in Heaven,
To Eveyln, darkeyed and fair,
And we almost caught strains of tthe music
That welcomed our little one there.

2.
They spoke, in the language of Heaven,
Of bliss for the sweet babe in store,
And they waited, impatient and loving,
To welcome her barque to the shore ...
Where white-hearted lilies are breathing
Sweet incense from odorous bells, ...
And the violets kneel in their beauty
At the feet of the sweet imortelles.

(CHORUS)

3.
And when, o'er the river a sailing,
Her barque near'd the silvery [?]rand,
She was welcom'd with Heaven's own greeting,
And led by the beateous band ...
To Mary, dear Mother of Jesus,
Who folded the babe to her breast, ...
With a kiss that was holy and tender,
And the tired little heart was at rest.

(CHORUS)
