1. 
Oh! Annie Gray, Old Annie Gray, 
Back from the distant main. 
To meet thee ’neath the old oak tree, 
I’ve come tonight again. 
The air is filled with grateful balms, 
The night is filled with stars, 
For twice ten thousand glitter bright 
Along the azure bars.

CHORUS (sung twice after each verse)
Lost (Lost, lost, lost,)
Annie Gray, (darling Annie Gray,
Lost (Lost, lost, lost,)
Annie Gray; (darling Annie Gray;)
For evermore my tears shall flow 
For thee last Annie Gray. 

2. 
You said you’d meet me Annie Gray! 
When I came back again, 
From wand’ring in the stranger’s land 
Beyond the stormy main. 
You said you’d watch; oh, Annie Gray! 
Throughout each weary year, 
And when I come again at length 
That you would meet me here.

3. 
Thou’rt sleeping dearest Annie Gray! 
Thy long eternal sleep: 
And I beside thy grave tonight 
My lonely vigil keep. 
I’m watching, Annie, by thy tomb, 
Beneath our trysting tree; 
Tomorrow, I will go again 
Upon the stormy sea.

4. 
But when my wanderings are o’er, 
On life’s dark tossing main, 
I’ll then come back to this old tree 
And meet with thee again— 
I’ll meet thee here again at eve 
When all the starlamps shine, 
And mingle ’neath the “old oak tree” 
My earthly dust with thine.
