1. Beneath the same zephry swayed branches,
  Where we sat in days that are gone,
Ere another bore off my own darling,
  And left me in grief to live on,
I dream o’er the past and its pleasures,
  And wonder if all love is vain,
Or muse in the sorrowful present,
  And sigh for my lost Lomie Laine.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The soft winds are evermore sighing,
  Above me the same sad refrain,
My weary heart evermore crying,
  Lost, darling Lomie Laine.

2. The green meadows open before me,
  Unfolding the treasures of spring,
The glad season comes in its beauty,
  But joy it nevermore can bring;
For she who was brighter than sunshine,
  And sweeter than breath of the plain,
And dearer than hopes of the future,
  Is now, alas! lost Lomie Laine.

3. Friends said, as they gazed on thy beauty,
  That joy and contentment were thine,
But I saw the lily hand tremble,
  Which erst rested calmly in mine;
The bridal and floating about thee,
  Concealed from the world weary pain.
Thy hand was bestowed on another,
  Thy heart was still mine, Lomie Laine.

4. I joined the gay throng at thy nuptials,
  And “wished thee much joy,” with a smile,
And feigned calm indif’frence at parting,
  My heart nearly breaking the while,
But now when the drama is finished,
  And thou art gone far o’er the main,
I come where fond memories linger,
  Of thee, my loved, lost, Lomie Laine.
