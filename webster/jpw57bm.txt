1. On a fair happy morning in the month of June, 
When the little birds were carroling gay, 
When the rye was to blossom and the flowers in bloom; 
Then I first beheld my bonnie Bell Maie. 
Oh! the bonnie,  bonnie dell, but I’ll never tell you where, 
Or how lovingly she smiled upon me 
But her cheeks were all blushes and her glossy fair hair, 
Fell in golden curls around her blue e’e.

2. And as blythe as the morning, she went gaily on
And her song was as merry as the day;
And oh! could I see the lassie going alone,
When I know it was my bonnie Bell Maie.
When the sun was sinking west in his gold and crimson vest,
I was leading her so happy and gay;
When we talked of the flowers, but my throbbing breast,
Told how much I loved my bonnie Bell Maie.

3. Then I kissed her rosy lips, and oh! need I tell why,
As her lovelit eyes were bending on me;
And she said when the hay was all gathered, and the rye;
Then my bonnie true wife she’d be.
When the corn was all in, and the colder winds blew,
And the village bells were ringing one day,
We made the sacred vows to be faithful and true,
And now she is no longer Bell Maie.
