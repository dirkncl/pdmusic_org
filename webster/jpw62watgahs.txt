1. 
We’re the boys that’s gay and happy,
Happy in the tented field;
With our nation’s banner o’er us
And its honor for our shield.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So let the cannons boom as they will,
We’ll be gay and happy still;
Gay and happy,
(We’ll be gay and happy, happy,) 
Gay and happy,
(We’ll be gay and happy, happy,)
We’ll be gay and happy, (happy) still.
Gay and happy,
(We’ll be gay and happy, happy,) 
Gay and happy,
(We’ll be gay and happy, happy,)
We’ll be gay and happy, (happy) still.

2. 
Friends at home, be gay and happy,
Never blush to speak our name;
Should our comrades fall in battle,
They shall share a soldier’s fame.

3. 
Colonel Stewart, gay and happy,
Holds the post with his command;
Seldom has a soldier’s honor
Ever graced a better man.

4. 
We’re the gay and happy Suckers,
From the State of Illinois;
Waiting till our Colonel orders
Us to flog the Rebel boys.

5. 
Rebels are not gay and happy,
For their serissh they cannot eat;
Some like birds we keep in cages,
Dining on hard stack and meat.

6. 
Girls at home be gay and happy,
Show that you have woman pride;
Never wed a homesick coward—
Wait and be a solder’s bride.

7. 
Gay and happy, sweet they answer,
None but fools will marry now;
Valliant men have all enlisted;
Unto cowards we’ll not bow.

8. 
We’re the girls that’s gay and happy,
Waiting for the end of strife;
Rather share a solder’s rations
Than to be a coward’s wife.

9. 
For the gay and for the happy,
We’re as constant as the dove;
But the man who dares not soldier,
Never can obtain our love.
