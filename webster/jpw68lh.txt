1. Give me a loving heart,
And merciful, and kind,
And strong to do its part,
Whate’er the work it find.

2. A loving heart bestow,
For love is all divine,
And from the fountains flow,
Sweet mercy’s all and wine.

3. Love, with a gentle hand,
Points to the starry sky,
And whispers of that land,
Where pleasures never die.

4. May He who rules by love
Take me to his dear side,
And bear me safe above
Where ill can ne’er betide.
