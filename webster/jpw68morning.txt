1. Rise from thy slumber, the morning is near!
Eastward its dawning begins to appear,
Tinting the rim of the blue bended sky,
Gilding the crown of the mountain top high.
Softly its rays up the steep azure climb,
Limning that blue with a pencil divine,
Back swing the silvery gales of the sky!
Proudly day's monarch ascended on high!

2. Out from the grove floats a coral so sweet,
Charmed are the senses its cadence to greet,
For, the glad birds from their musical throats,
Blend in that choral their welcoming notes.
Daisies and buttercups open their eyes,
Greeting the morn with a gladdened surprise
Violets gently and daffodils gay,
Censors of perfume are off'ring the day.

3. Brighter the flush that the rose petal tips,
Sweeter the breath from her odorous lips,
And the fair lilly's pure heart of the snow,
Thrills for the moment with sunlight aglow.
Down at the foot of the emerald hill,
Rises the rhythmical song of the rill,
And where the meadows are stretching away,
Visions of summer clouds loomingly lay.

4. Amethyst hills in the far distance lies,
Cutting the line 'twixt the earth and the sky:
Hulls of the crystal and crytaline shrouds,
Steal through the azure the ships of the clouds.
Rise from thy slumber, the morning is near!
Glory and beauty are calling thee here!
Join in the anthem that nature doth sing!
Trustful and joyful thy offering bring!
