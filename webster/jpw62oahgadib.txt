Now I tell you, by de way,

In Missouri, where de bellion was so strong,
Dat de nigger must be free,
But Abe didn't jes agree,
So he "modify," an' dat we tink was wrong.

When de hound was on our track,
An' de Lord stan' by him ebry time he plan.

But MeClellan tho't de way,

Diggin' trenches for de rebels, in de sun,
While de Yankee sojers work,
With de shovel and de dirt,
When dey ought to use de saber an' de gun.

Dat de Government depend
On de nigger with his pick-axe an' his spade;
Dat de Yankee boys could fight,
But dey nebbertink it right,
For to take up diggin' ditches as a trade.

For to teach de niggers how to write an' read;
But dat Stanley, Linkum send,
To de people did contend,
Dat ob such a ting we niggers hab no need.

O, de niggers like to tell,
Massa Halleck, mighty well,
When de rebels dere at Corinth run away,
But ob course dat couldn't be,
When his "order number tree,"
Dribe de niggers out beyon' de lines to stay.

O, ye niggers, let us sing

Dat de Lord may bless de Yankee sogers brave!
O, I tink I hear dey'r song,
As dey proudly march along,
To redeem de poor an' broken-hearted slave.

An' our eyes, dat look in tears
Through de long an' bitter years,
