1.
In Bethlehem was Jesus born,
The Son of God Supreme;
And wise men from the eastward came,
Whose eyes his star had seen.
When Herod sent them on their way,
Afar to Bethlehem,
A light to guide their steps a-right,
That star preceded them.

2.
And as their longing eyes beheld
Its clear and gentle rays,
How swelled their hearts with untold joy!
How warmed their lips with praise!
If we so seek to find the way
To loving Jesus' feet,
Faith's guiding star, with gentle light,
Our longing eyes shall greet.

3.
And we may bear our gifts of gold,
And myrrh, and frankincense,
The off'rings of a comtrite heart,
That sinning, yet repents.
And he who pities sinful man
Those gifts of love shall bear,
And place them near the Father's throne,
To be our witness there.
