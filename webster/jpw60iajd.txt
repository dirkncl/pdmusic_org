1. Oh a sunny summer morning,
Early  as the dew was dry,
Up the hill I went a berrying;
Need I, need I,— tell you why?
Farmer Davis had a daughter,
And it happen’d that I knew;
On each sunny morning Jenny,
Up the hill went berrying too.

2. Lonely work is picking berries,
So I join’d her on the hill;
“Jenny dear,” said I, “your basket’s
Quite too large for one to fill;”—
So we staid— we two— to fill it,
Jenny talking— I was still—
Leading where the hill was steepest,
Picking berries up the hill.

3. “This is up hill work,” said Jenny;
“So is life,” said I, shall we
Climb it up alone, or Jenny
Will you come and climb with me?
Redder than the blushing berries
Jenny’s cheeks a moment grew,
While without delay she answer’d,
“I will come and climb with you."
