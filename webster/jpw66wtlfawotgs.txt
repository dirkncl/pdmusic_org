1.
Put away the little dresses,
  That the darling used to wear,
She will need them on earth never,--
  She has climbed the golden stair;
She is with the happy angels,
  And I long for her sweet kiss,
Where here little feet are waiting
  In the real of perfect bliss.

CHORUS
Angels whisper that our darling
  Is in lands of love, so fair,
That her little feet are waiting,
  Close behind the golden stair.

2.
Lay aside her little playthings
  Wet with mother's pearly tears,--
How we shall miss little Nellie
  All the coming, weary years!--
Fold the dainty, little dresses
  That she never more will wear
For her little feat are waiting
  Up above the golden stair.

(CHORUS)

3.
Kiss the little curly tresses,
  Cut from her bright, golden hair,--
Do the angels kiss our darling
  In the realm so bright and fair?
Oh! we pray to meet out darling
  For a long, long sweet embrace
Where the little feet are waiting--
  And we meet her face to face.

(CHORUS)
