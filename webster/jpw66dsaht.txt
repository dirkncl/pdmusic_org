1. 
O, the happy, bygone moments 
That so quickly o’er me flew, 
In the time so well remembered 
When our marriage life was new; 
Then the hours pass’d unnoted, 
Then affection’s glow was bright, 
Then no shadows came between us— 
Husband, stay with me tonight. 

[Refrain sung after each verse]
Darling stay with me tonight; 
Oh, do not go abroad tonight; 
Dearest husband, stay at home tonight.

2. 
Dearest one, have you forgotten 
All the joys of long ago— 
How we used to sit together 
In the firelight’s cheerful glow? 
Then you told me that you lov’d me, 
Then my heart was ever light— 
Come, dear husband, sit beside me, 
Do not go abroad tonight.

3. 
Ah! I know the spell that’s bound you 
In a worse than bondman’s chains; 
Waiting, list ’ning for you footsteps, 
Oft I kear the wild refrains; 
I have seen the gay carousal 
In the embers’ flickring light, 
Heard in winds the glasses rattle— 
Husband do not go tonight.

4. 
Little Willie often asks me,
Ere he kneels to evening prayer,
“Mama why does Papa leave us— 
Are there scenes for him more fair?”
Oh, I cannot tell our darling
All that breaks upon my sight,
So I tell him “Papa’s coming”—
Stay, oh! stay at home tonight.

5. 
Hark! the storm is roaring wildly,
Think, how lonely I shall be—
Little Willie, sleeping calmly,
Dreams, perchance, that you’re with me;
Bless him, Father, while he slumbers,
Shield him with Thy arms of might,
Save, oh, save him from the tempter—
Husband, stay at home to night.

6. 
Nay, frown not my dearest husband,
I would never seem to chide;
Would that I could e’er seem cheerful,
Would my sorrows I could hide;
But, sometimes, my heart seems breaking—
Father, help me to do right—
Oh, my darling, pity— love me;
Do not go abroad tonight.
