1. 
Sweet Mary, me darling,
The war clouds are looming,
And traitors are plotting,
To fetter the land!
I go on the morrow,
Where cannon are booming,
To join in the battle,
With liberty’s band.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Fare thee well sweet Mary Mavourneen,
It grieves me to leave thee, dear bride of my soul;
Fare thee well sweet Mary Mavourneen,
It grieves me to leave thee, dear bride of my soul.

2. 
The land that has bless’d us
With love and protection,
Is smitten with peril,
Beleaguer’d with foes;
The brave and true hearted,
With loyal affection,
Must march wher the banner
Of liberty goes.

3. 
With tearmoistened eyelids,
I look through the gloaming,
And think of the pleasures
That blessed us of old!
It’s breaking me heart is,
Sweet Mary Maloning,
With sorrow to leave ye,
Dear bride of me soul.

4. 
The Emerold Island
Away in the ocean,
With white breakers kissing
Its murmuring shore,
America’s armor
Will some day be needing,
That British oppression
May curse her no more.

5. 
I go, but remember,
Sweet Mary, me darling,
In camp or in marching,
To ye I am true!
And if ye should listen 
In vain my returning,
I fall ’neath our banner—
The stars and the blue.
