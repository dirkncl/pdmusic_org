1. I rambled one morning at earliest dawning,
  Along the green banks of the sweet river Nore;
The skylarks were singing, from heavenward flinging
  The pure liquid notes from their wonderful score.
I halted to harken where shadows did darken
  The path winding on by the sweet river Nore;
When forth from her hiding, in nature confiding,
  Trip’d lightly the maiden called Floraline Shore.

2. The skylarks were singing, still joyfully flinging
  Their matin songs over the sweet river Nore;
The waters were flowing, the soft air was blowing,
  And flowers were blooming, as never before;
But there in the dawning of roseate morning
  Whose beauties envisioned the sweet river Nore;
Where all was elysian, the lovliest vision,
  Was she whom the muses named Floraline Shore.

3. The waters were flowing, the moist breezes blowing,
  And morn again dawned on the sweet river Nore;
The skylarks were winging, and heavenward winging,
  The songs that they sung in the springtime of yore;
And there the old story renewed on its glory;
  Was whisper’d again by the sweet river Nore;
And O! may I never forget that sweet river,
  Or cease to be charmed with its Floraline Shore.
