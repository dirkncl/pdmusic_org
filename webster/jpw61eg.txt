1. What was that you talked about
  Elsie Grey, Elsie Grey,
Coming through the clover field
  That sweet summer day?
What was it he whispered you,
  That took so long to say?
’Twas evening when he saw you home,
  Little Elsie Grey.

2. Back you came all rosy red,
  Elsie Grey, Elsie Grey,
Must have been sweet words he said
  To make you smile so gay.
Was it of the birds and flowers,
  The busy labouring bees,
The murmur of the brooklet’s tide,
  Or the wind among the trees?

3. Very happy then you looked,
  Elsie Grey, Elsie Grey,
Never blither looks the fawn
  In its woodland play.
But your lip trembled though it wore
  A deeper richer hue,
And on your cheek a tiny tear
  Lay like a drop of dew.

4. Child, I guess what he had said
  To thee, dear Elsie Grey;
Guess’d the soft sweet tale of love
  Revealed that summer day.
Ah! beware! for sweetest joys
  Are shortest in their stay,
And lose it not the joy it seems
  To thee sweet Elsie Grey.
