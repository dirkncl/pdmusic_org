1. I have a little winsome friend
That lives across the way,
Whose snapping eyes and bonnie smile
My unresisting heart beguile,
And make me often say,
I love my own, but of the rest
There’s none so sweet as Katie West.

CHORUS [overlapping voices, sung after each VERSE]
[SAT]
Oh! Katie, Darling Katie,
Oh! Katie, loving little Katie West.
[B]
Charming little, darling little Katie,
Darling little loving Katie West;
Oh! Katie, loving little Katie West.


2. I’ve seen her trip along the street,
With a wee pail in her hand,
“To get some milk;” she gaily said,
With a voice so sweet, as on she sped,
Like a queen in fairy land;
And then I said, they’re surely blest,
Whose hearts are cheer’d by Katie West.

3. She’s a little lady, that I know,
With a twinkle to of pride,
That makes her bloom like any rose,
Where e’er the sunlight comes and goes,
From morn til ev’entide—
Thus may she bloom, while they are blest
Whose hearts are cheer’d by Katie West.

4. And He who sees the sparrow fall,
Will watch her day and night;
While parents dear, by deed and word,
Will wisdom’s lessons teach their bird,
And guide her steps aright—
And time will make them more than blest,
With the faithful love of Katie West.
