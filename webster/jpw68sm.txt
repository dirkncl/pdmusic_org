1. 
Sabbath morning, bright and balmy, 
Comes to greet us, with a smile! 
Holy church bells full of music, 
Call us from our cares awhile; 
Day of all the week the dearest, 
Day of sweet and sacred rest; 
Thou dost bring the wine of gladness! 
Balm to soothe the troubled breast.

2. 
Blessed rest from anxious labor! 
Cease thy working, weary hand! 
Let the toiling mind cease toiling! 
Love divine this day hath planned. 
Cast the busy world behind thee, 
With its clamer and its din! 
Open wide thy heart of gladness! 
Let the Sabbath influence in.
