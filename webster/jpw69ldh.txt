1. Pretty little dimpled hands,
  Busy, busy all the day,
With their tips of pink and pearl,
  Into mischief ev’ry way;
Sinless little dimpled hands,
  Busy, busy all the day,
Helping Maggie with her work,
  Turning Maggie’s work to play.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Pretty little dimpled hands,
  Busy, busy all the day,
With their tips of pink and pearl,
  Turning Maggie’s work to play.

2. Pretty little dimpled hands,
  Smoothing papa’s face and hair,
Helping papa read and write,
  Oh! so busy eve’rywhere;
Dainty little dimpled hands,
  Making oh! such happy days,
Throwing kisses warm and sweet,
  In such winsome, loving ways.

3. Darling little dimpled hands,
  Now so busy everyway,
When they’re larger, stronger grown,
  Will they work instead of play;
Pretty little dimpled hands,
  When the day of labor comes
Will they feed the hungry poor,
  Will they help the fallen ones?

4. Pretty little dimpled hands,
  Will they work where orphans dwell,
Will they soothe the aching head,
  Will they serve the Master well;
Precious little dimpled hands,
  Now so busy with their play,
Work enough there’ll be to do,
  In the coming after day.
