1. The Better Day has dawned at last,
  The night of error passed away,
The gloom of strife has fully passed,
  And Peace assumes imperial sway;
The forest blossoms as the rose,
  All men are brothers and content,
The “Union” subjugates her foes,
  And binds with steel a continent.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then hail the welcome day, of rest
  With “peace, with peace on earth, on earth, good will to man,”
The Star of Empire’s in the west,
  And bands, and bands bands of steel the earth shall span.

2. No more shall sound war’s wild alarm,
  No more shall brothers grasp the sword,
No more be seen a world in arms,
  For potent now the Holy Word;
God’s will is wrought thro’ feeble man,
  His ways thro’ us are made to show,
To Him the glory of the plan
  Whereby we have the iron bow.

3. From farthest shores of rock bound Maine,
  Thro’ all New England hills and dales,
Across an Empire’s wide champaign,
  And o’er the fruitful central vales;
O’er waters rushing to the sea,
  Through mountains tow’ring to the sky,
On, on, and on, where deserts be,
  The care of progress still doth fly.

4. And farther where the snowcapped hills
  Look down upon the plains below,
And mountains pour their icy rills
  Along the banks where flowers grow.
Through far Sierra’s rough defiles,
  Tow’r’d California’s golden strand,
O’er what was once the weary miles,
  Now stretches forth the shining hand.

5. Let God be praised for wonders wrought,
  And man be praised for labor done,
All hail the golden age of Thought,
  Hurrah for victory Peace hath won!
The forest hoar shall melt away,
  The savage torch shall wane and pale,
The West shall greet the rising Day,
  And all the world shall go by rail.
