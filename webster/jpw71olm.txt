"Only Love Me" (22 July 1871)
Song & Chorus
Words by Alfred Sully, Esq.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
What to me are gems and jewels,
All the fairest things of earth;
If my soul is filled with sadness,
If my soul is but a dearth;
What is hope without fruition,
What is love linked with condition;
All I ask below above me,
Is to love me, only love me.

CHORUS
If you'd only love me, (When the happy stars of heaven,)
If you'd only love me, (Fill the vaulted dome above me,)
If you'd only love me, (Then my soul cries in its craving,)
(Love me, only love me,)
If you'd only love love me.

2.
You have filled my hands with treasures,
You have blessed me with your smile,
You have lavished on my weakness,
All that could my soul beguile;
But I crave a greater blessing,
And I pine for your carressing;
I'd envy not the stars above me,
If you'd love me, only love me.

(CHORUS)

3.
Let the world and all it's treasures,
Pass from my for evermore;
Let your love with mighty pinions,
Lift me up to heaven's door;
Well I know the very angels,
Earthward bound with glad evangels;
Could but envy though above me,
If you'd love me, only love me.

(CHORUS)
