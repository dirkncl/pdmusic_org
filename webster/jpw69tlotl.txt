1. I’m wearing awa’, Jean,
  Like snaw when its thaw, Jean,
I’m wearing awa’, Jean,
  To the land o’ the leal;
There’s nae sorrow there, Jean,
  There’s nae cauld nor care, Jean,
The day is aye fair, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The lost we shall find, Jean,
  The dear an’s sae kind, Jean,
In days o’ langsyne, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal;
Then farewell, my sin Jean,
  This warld’s care is vain, Jean,
We’ll meet and be fain, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal.


2. Ye were aye leal and true, Jean,
  Your task’s ended noo’, Jean,
And I’ll welcome you, Jean,
  To the land o’ the leal;
Our bonnie bairn’s there, Jean,
  She was baith guide an’ fair, Jean,
We grudg’d her right sair, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal.

3. Then dry that fu’e’e, Jean,
  My soul would be free, Jean,
And angels wait me, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal;
Now, farewell, my ain Jean,
  This warld’s care is vain, Jean,
We’ll meet and be fain, Jean,
  In the land o’ the leal.
