Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Ah, don't be sorrowful, darling,
And don't be sorrowful pray,
Taking the year together, my dear,
There isn't more night than day!
'Tis rainy weather, my darling,
Time's waves, they heavily run.
But taking the year together my dear;
There isn't more cloud than sun!

CHORUS
Then, don't be sorrowful, darling,
Don't be sorrowful pray;
For taking the year together, my dear,
There isn't more night than day.

2.
We are old folks now, my darling,
Our heads they are growing gray,
But taking the year around, my dear,
You will always find th' May!
We have had our May, my darling,
And our roses, long ago,
And th' time of year is coming,
For th' silent night and th' snow!

(CHORUS)

3.
And God is God, my darling --
Of night as well as of day,
And we feel and know that we can go
Wherever he leads the way,
As God of the night, my darling,
Of the night of death, so grim;
The gate that heads out of life, good wife,
Is th' gate that heads to Him.

(CHORUS)
