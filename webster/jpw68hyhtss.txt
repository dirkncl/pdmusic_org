1. (Teachers.)
Have you heard the sweet story, how Jesus came down
From the mansions of glory above,
With the crown of redemption his children to crown,
And the gift of his bounteous love?

2. (Children.)
We have heard how the Saviour from Paradise came,
And with blessing made all the world glad;
How he pitied each sinner who called on his name,
And with pardon made weeping hearts glad.

3. (All together.)
Let us all love the Saviour so gentle and kind,
Let us love one another as well,
Till the beautiful haven of rest we shall find,
And with him in that bright haven dwell.
