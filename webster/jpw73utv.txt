"Under the Violets" (1873)
Words by Hope Ardor
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Sleeping where the sunbeams linger--
Longert, o'er the silent breast,
Where the violets and daisies,
Watch together, o'er the rest.
When the birds sing softest music,
O'er the dear head lying low,
And the summers sweetest breezes
Wander gently to and fro.

CHORUS
Daisy, Daisy, O! my Daisy, (Daisy, darling Daisy,)
Neath the violets laid to rest, (laid to rest,)
Where the sunbeams longest linger, (linger, longerst linger,)
O're my darling's quiet breast (quiet breast).

2.
Earth seemed purer, brighter, true,
While she dwelt amongst us here,
Lives were better for her presence
Now a heart but held her dear.
Heaven hath gain'd an angel brighter,
Earth has lost a golden gem,
She hath yielded earthly treasures,
For a heav'nly diadem.

(CHORUS)
