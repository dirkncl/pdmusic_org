1.
Under the beautiful stars tonight,
Happy are they who may sleep,
Under the tenderly floating light,
Hunger and wretchedness creep;
Many a weary heart sadly beats,
Many a loving one coldness meets,
Many a sorrow the soft wind greets,
Under the beautiful stars,
Under the beautiful stars.

2.
Under the beautiful stars tonight,
Fortune still gathers her own,
Under the quivering doubtful light,
Walketh a wanderer lone;
Lost to her feet are the pleasant ways,
Gone from her soul are the homelit rays,
Life is a burden, for death she prays,
Under the beautiful stars,
Under the beautiful stars.

3.
Under the beautiful stars tonight,
Laughter goes merrily on,
Under the tremulous lambent light,
Grieve we for cherished ones gone;
Dearest ones who in the valley sleep,
Erring ones, loving nor care could keep,
Hopes that are buried shall make us weep,
Under the beautiful stars,
Under the beautiful stars.

4.
Under the beautiful stars tonight,
Many a pleasure is known.
Under the wavering fitful light,
Misery claimeth her own;
So through the rolling and changeful years
Ever recurring are hopes and fears,
Blessings and curses, and smiles and tears,
Under the beautiful stars,
Under the beautiful stars.
