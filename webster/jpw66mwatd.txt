1. Long, long years ago, when childhood
  Wore its sweet and mystic spell,
O’er the happy hours of pleasure
  That we now remember well—
When the hue of daylight faded
  And the darkness gather’d o’er—
For her little staying children
Mother waited at the door.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Mother’s waiting at the door,
Waiting for her childhood ever—
Where no parting comes to sever,
Mother’s waiting, Mother’s waiting,
Mother’s waiting at the door.

2. When in after years, came changes,
  Sickness and the hand of death,
When we saw beloved ones dying—
  Listened for their parting breath;—
Then came she who dearly loved them,
  Like an angel on life’s shore,
And, while guiding them in heaven
  Mother waited at the door.

3. Now we know our darling mother,
  Waits for us, as in those days,
Yet she waits above in heaven,
  Now amid earth’s changeful way;—
Where no sorrow comes to sadden,
  On the heavenly, golden shore,
Where there comes angelic welcome,
  Mother’s waiting at the door.
