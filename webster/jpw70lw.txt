1. Never to wait and listen again
  For the sound of thy coming feet;
Never to see in your eyes again,
  The look that I used to meet;
Never to hope, or love again,
  Thro’ the long, long years to be;
And this is the bitter, bitter end
  Of the love you gave to me!

2. Only to think in the coming years,
  Of my wasted love and truth;
Only to see, through blinding tears,
  The ghost of my murdered youth;
Only to pray to my Heavenly Friend,
  That the weary years be few,
And this is the bitter, bitter end
  Of the love I gave to you!

3. We shall meet no more; o’r the sunny skies,
  There darkness this dread eclipse;
Never to look in my darling’s eyes,
  Or to touch those faithless lips,
I clasped your hand for the last, last time,
  Ere the dreams of my lifetime fell;
And now on the wings of this idle rhyme,
  I send you my last farewell!
