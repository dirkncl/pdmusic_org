"The Olive of Love" (17 July 1871)
Words by J. O. Barrett
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
The morning impearled in the dewdrops of night,
  Baptizes the world in her reseate light,
And prints on the undulate lips of the sea,
  The kisses that dance from the main to the lea.

CHORUS
But sweeter in love is the soft cooing dove,
That brings with her kisses the Olive of love.


2.
From purity's bosom is blossoming now,
  The buds of a wreath for a innocent brow,
Whose odorous sphere is an echoing bell,
  Entrenching the soul in a magical spell.

CHORUS
But sweeter in love from the eden above,
Is the bloom in my heart of the Olive of love.

3.
Reposing in beauty beneath the watch stars
  That lift us aloft in their fiery cars,
Are islands celestial by sainted ones trod
  Arrayed in the peace of the glory of God.

CHORUS
But the islands above are not equal my dove,
To the beautiful leaves of the Olive of love.

4.
To Heaven I gaze through thy soul speaking eyes
  And see where the holiest paradise lies,
I feel thy heart beat with a musical flow
  With constancy true as the angels e'er know.

CHORUS
While the play of its love, like the fountain above,
Refreshes the branch of the Olive of love.
