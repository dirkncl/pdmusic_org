1. Let no bell toll when I am gone,
  No solemn pageant throng the street,
No weeds of mourning be put on,
  No sable crape the sunlight greet;
For but a year, or month, or day,
  May I life’s pleasant paths pursue,
All present forms shall melt away,
  In earth’s superb dessolving view.

2. Two blades of grass spring fresh and green,
  Together woo the summer sun,
Anon where both were bending seen,
  The wand’ring zephyr finds but one;
Fair Nature still with joyful mien,
  As bright by smiles at morning’s dawn,
Nor drops her jewel tears at e’en.
  For one green spray forever gone.

3. Twin roses blush at morning tide,
  Among the rosetree’s dewy leaves,
And shed their fragrance side by side,
  Bebeath the vineclad cottage eaves;
But ere the shadows fall at night,
  One decks the breast of maiden fair,
The other, in the  moon’s pale light
  Alone, still blossoms in beauty there.

4. God’s law each creature must obey,
  The brightest flowers bloom and fall,
And Nature keeps her even way,
  Nor spreads o’er them a sombre all;
So, when shall come my turn to die,
  Let but the veil be quickly drawn,
I would that not a tear or sigh,
  Should stir one heart when I am gone.
