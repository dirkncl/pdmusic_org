"I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets" (1860)
No. 57.
Words by Maud Irving
Music Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I'll twine 'mid the ringlets
  Of my raven black hair,
The lilies so pale
  And the roses so fair,
|: The myrtle so bright
  With an emerald hue,
And the pale aronatus
  With eyes of bright blue. :|

2.
I'll sing and I'll dance,
  My laugh shall be gay;
I'll cease this wild weeping --
  Drive sorrow away,
|: Tho' my heart is now breaking,
  He never shall know
That _his_ name made me tremble
  And my pale cheeks to glow. :|

3.
I'll think of him never --
  I'll be wildly gay,
I'll charm ev'ry heart,
  And the crowd I will sway,
|: I'll live yet to see him,
  Regret the dark hour
When he won, then neglected,
  The frail wildwood flower. :|

4.
He told me he loved me,
  And promis'd to love,
Trough ill and misfortune,
  All others above,
|: Another has won him;
  Ah, misery to tell;
He left me in silence --
  no word of farewell. :|

5.
He taught me to love him,
  He call'd me his flower
That blossom'd for him
  All the brighter each hour;
|: But I woke from my dreaming,
  My idol was clay;
My visions of love
  Have _all_ faded away. :|
