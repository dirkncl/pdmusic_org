To Mrs. J. W. Carhart, Racine, Wis.
"Bury Me in the Garden, Mother" (1873)
Words by J. W. Carhart, D. D.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Bury me in the garden, mother,
Where the roses bloom so fair;
Bury me where the blue birds warble,
And sweet odors fill the air,
Bury me 'neath the yellow Jessamine,
Where the honeysuckles twine,
Bury me where you love to linger
Where the dewdrops round you shine.

2.
Bury me in the garden, mother,
Where the sunshine and the showers
Shall perfume and paint with beauty
All the sweet and tender flowers
Bury me in the garden, mother
Where the angels love to stay;
I will come with them and greet you,
As they lead the shining way.

3.
Bury me in the pensive twilight,
While the zephyrs softly play;
You may sing to me your "Goodnight."
I shall wake to endless day.
I will come, and bending o'er you;
Catch the fragrance of the flowers;
I will with your falling teardrops
And beguile your lonely hours.
