From Webster's Western Gems
"Zula Zong" (1860)
Song and Chorus.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875.
Words by C. M. Ballard.

1.
I have loved thee, Zula Zong,
For thy life was all a song;
It was all a cheerful smile,
It was sunshine all the while;
It was all a dream of love,
Brought by angels from above,
It was like some fairy tale,
Told within a silvan vale.

CHORUS
Oh! Zula, mould'ring Zula,
Silent is thy silver song;
Oh! Zula, darling Zula,
Dear departed Zula Zong.

2.
I have miss'd thee, Zula Zong,
And the days are sad and long,
When the winter sifts in snow,
When the normal blossoms blow,
When the sheaves of wheat are bright,
And when swallows take their flight---
Night and morning all the while,
Zula Zong, I miss thy smile.

(CHORUS)

3.
Sleepeth now my zula zong,
Ended is her silver song,
Empty is the desert well,
Broken is the mystic spell;
There's no sunshine on the main,
There's no shadow on the plain,
There's no footfall at the door,
As there was in days of yore.

(CHORUS)

4.
As a rose born out of time,
As a bell struck from a chime
As the key note of a song
Was my gentle zula zong.
As the water to the sea,
So was zula zong to me,
As the blue to yonder sky,
Thus to zula zong was I.

(CHORUS)

5.
I shall meet thee, zula zong,
I shall hear, again, thy song,
Where the old is ever new,
Where the skies are ever blue.
I shall greet thy golden smiles,
In the sunset amber isles,
In the land of light and song,
E'en in heaven, zula zong.

(CHORUS)
