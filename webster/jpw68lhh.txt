1. Little Hattie Harvey, child of golden hair,
  A merry, merry Christmas, and a New Year bright and fair;
May the sweet May blossoms woo your tiny feet,
  And bird notes mingle music with your gentle voice so sweet. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Hattie dear, Hattie darling one,
  Sprightly as a fairy and as lightsome as the sun;
Hattie dear, child of light and love,
  Angels smile upon thee from that better world above.

2. Little Hattie Harvey, child of hazel eyes,
  Which gleam like stars of silver set in deepest azure skies;
May the unknown future break for thee as bright,
  As holy summer morning with its flood of golden light.

3. Little Hattie Harvey, child of wondrous mirth,
  There’s not a fairer flower budding on the gladsome earth;
May each wingéd zephyr bear for thee along,
  A breath of choicest perfume from the sweetest flower of song.
