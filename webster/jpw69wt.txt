1. Awhile the dazzling scenes of earth,
  Awhile the whirl its pleasing mirth;
Elate with joy, oppressed with fears,
  A few short years ’mid smiles and tears,

CHORUS [overlapping voices, sung after each VERSE]
But Oh! my soul what then?
What then? What then?
But Oh! my soul what then?

2. Awhile the weary toil and strife,
  Awhile the restless throbbing life,
A little while the stinging pain,
  A little share of worldly gain,

3. What though we gain a glorious name,
  And all the world repeat our fame,
’Tis but the fantom’s wav’ring light,
  Which soon must pass from mortal sight,

4. For us who live, a narrow bed,
  With all the long forgotten mirth,
A shroud, a coffin, and a pall,
  A couch wherein there’s room for all,
