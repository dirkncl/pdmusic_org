To Mrs. E. R. S. Dyer.
"Nelly Gordon" (1854)
Song.
Written by Sidney Dyer.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875.

1.
I have loved thee, Nelly Gordon,
  Till my heart now cleaves to thine,
As devoted Nelly Gordon,
  As the tendril to the vine.
Ah, to me thy smile is brighter
  Than the blush of vernal hours,
And thy fairy footsteps lighter
  Than the down of summer flowers;

[REFRAIN]
Oh, then tell me, Nelly Gordon,
  If thy spirit turns to me,
As devoted Nelly Gordon,
  As mine ever cleaves to thee.

2.
I will love thee, Nelly Gordon
  When the false and vain deceive.
I will shield thee, Nelly Gordon,
  When, forsaker, thall shall grieve;
And though time may shade thy beauty,
  I will never change my vow,
To a cold and formal duty,
  But will love thee then as now.

(REFRAIN]
