1. There’s a land that is fairer that day,
And by faith we may see it afar,
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[with overlapping parts]
[SA]
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore!
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore!
[TB]
In the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, by and by
In the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

2. We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more—
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

3. To our beautiful Father above
We will offer the tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of his love,
And the blessings that hallow our days!
