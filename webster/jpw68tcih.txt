1.
A little child who loves to play,
And read his Bible too,
Shall rise above the sky one day,
And sing as angels do.

CHORUS [overlapping voices]
[Soprano and Alto]
Shall live in heaven, that world above,
Where all is joy and peace and love.
[Tenor and Bass]
Shall live in heaven, shall live in heaven,
that bright and glorious world above,
Where all is joy, where all is joy,
Where all is peace and love.

2.
Look up, dear children! See that star
Which shines so brightly there!
But you shall brighter shine by far,
When in that world so fair.

CHORUS [overlapping voices]
[Soprano and Alto]
A harp of gold you each shall have,
And sing the power of Christ to save.
[Tenor and Bass]
A harp of gold, a harp of gold
you each shall have, you each shall have,
And sing the power, and sing the power
of loving Christ to save.
