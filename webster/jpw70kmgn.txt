1. O, darling lay your hand in mine,
While slowly, slowly, slowly going,
We watch the early morn decline,
And note how dark the night is growing;
I feel the pressure of your hand,
Your tender face no longer seeing,
And wait to hear love’s last command,
While the last ling’ring light is fleeing.
Now lean one moment on my heart,
No one can see in this dim light,
Lift your dear face and ’ere we part,
Kiss me good night, kiss me good night.

2. Nay, darling, while you hold my hand,
I cannot, cannot, cannot hear you:
You bid me go, with soft command,
But, ah, your clasp still keeps me near you.
And yet our hour is over past;
I cannot stay another minute;
This time our good night is the last,
And all my soul goes to you in it.
So lean one moment on my heart,
No one can see in this dim light,
Lift your dear face, and ’ere we part,
Kiss me good night, kiss me good night.

3. Why, darling, call my back again,
So softly, softly, softly sighing?
You did not? then ’tis very plain
I must have heard my own heart crying.
And now, to cheer my lonely way
(I know how very late ’tis growing)
Say that you love me, darling, say;
And then, indeed I must be going,
So lean one moment on my heart,
No one can see in this dim light,
Lift your dear face, and ’ere we part,
Kiss me good night, kiss me good night.
