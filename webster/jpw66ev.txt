1. Dear Evelyn Vere was the joy of my childhood,
The light of life’s morning, the dream of my youth,
Ne’er flowers bloomed fairer in garden or wildwood—
A marvel of beauty, of love, and of truth;
Together we roamed o’er the green grassy meadows,
And chased the bright moments of many a year;
But cruel death came with one closing dayts shadows
And snatched from my side darling Evellyn Vere.

CHORUS 1-3.
The flowers she loved are now blooming above her,
The murmuring river flows
[words missing from orginal source]

2. The made her a bed ’neath the old weeping willow,
Near murmuring “Hoosae,” where oft we had roved;
And gentle hands hold her fiar head on the pillow,
And garlanded round it the flowers she loved.
I heard the bell toll on that funeral morning,
While grief stricken friends sadly wept o’er her bier,—
I knew her pure spirit was heaven adorning,
But my heart was buried with Evelyn Vere.

3. Ah! long years have passed since I knew this great sorrow;
I’ve wandered afar over mountain and sea,
And tried to forget— but with each coming morrow
Comes back to its beauty the lost life to me,
I cannot forget the fair valley of “Hoosae,”
Whose daisydecked bosom holds all I hold dear,
Where birds are still working the oldentime music—
The songs that I sang with sweet Evelyn Vere.
