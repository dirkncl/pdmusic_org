1. Have a kind word for those
  Whose misfortunes and woes
Have darkened their pathway in life;
  And with words of good cheer
  Make the earth to appear
A realm that is free from all strife;
  Have a kind word for those
  Whose misfortunes and woes
Have darkened their pathway in life;
  Have a kind word for all
  And let smiles of love fall
Though sorrows and dangers are rife.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Have a kind word for them all,
  Who may meet you on life’s shore,
Heeding not the frowns that fall.
Have a kind word for them all.

2. Have a kind word for one
  Who has battled and won
In conflicts that mortals must fight;
  Have a kind smile in store
  For the pour at your door,
Who struggle thro’d sorrow’s dark night;
  Have a kind word for one
  Who has battled and won
In conflicts that mortals must fight,
  Have a kind word for all
  Till the reaper’s last call
Is heard from the blest land of light!
