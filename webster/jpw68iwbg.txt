1. I wil be good today— Brother will you?
Cheerful and gentle, and loving and true,
Keeping my heart in my study and play,
Fresh as the morning, and bright as the day.

2. I will be good today— Sister will you?
Trying my best some good action to do.
So when the night, with the shadows shall come,
I may be glad for the work I have done.

3. I will be glad today— Comrades will you?
Try for the right to do battle anew;
Swift are the moments with rich blessings fraught!
Shall we misuse them, or use them for naught!?

4. If we are glad today, what shall we find?
Happiness ever, and sweet peace of mind.
Flowers of love in our young hearts shall grow,
And his rich blessing— the Lord shall bestow.
