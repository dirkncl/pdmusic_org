"The Patriot Mother's Prayer 'Protect My Boy'" (1863)
Chant
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Father of love, Infinite God
Supremest Ruler over all
"Thou hearest the young raven's cry,
And noteth ev'ry sparrow's fall,"
I trust him to Thee! my heart's last joy;
Protect him, Father, bless my boy!

2.
He is my pride, I've wonder'd oft
What off'ring I could bring to Thee;
And when his eyes, with love dews soft,
Were raised in prayer for him or me,
I did not dream that war's alloy,
Could come to us, my darling boy!

REFRAIN
Bless my boy, oh! bless my boy!
Protect him, Father! bless my boy!

3.
My nation's flag, Liberty's shrine,
Vile traitor's hands have now defiled,
For Freedom's, take this gift of mine,
I have naught else--oh, take my child.
Oh! Father, forbid them to destroy,
Our country, but protect my boy!

(REFRAIN)

4.
But if--oh! God, spare me that woe--
He ne'er should tell of vict'ry won,
His cold form on the field lay low--
I'll say, "Thy will, and mine, be done;"
Then with those souls in endless joy.

(REFRAIN)
