1. 
Be of good cheer my darling— 
  We will together go 
Adown the journey of life, my dear, 
  Blest in the love we know; 
And though the winds are moaning, love, 
  And storms are in the sky, 
We’ll keep our hearts in the light, my dear, 
  Till the shadows have all gone by.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Be of good cheer, be of good cheer, 
be of good cheer my darling; 
Fear  not, my love, that the way be lone, 
For hand in hand we will journey on, 
To the land where the love have waited long,  
To bid us a dear “good morning”("good morning") 
A dear kind welcome home, (welcome home, welcome home).

2. 
Be of good cheer my darling—
  Love is in store for you:
Thou life hath often a stormy day,
  Sunshine will glimmer through;
So rest your head upon my breast,
  It ne’er has been untrue,
But ev’ry throb of this heart, my dear,
  In its love has throbbed for you.

3. 
Be of good cheer my darling—
  Only a little way,
And we shall step to the further shore,
  Blessing the perfect day;
And there, as here, thy hand shall clasp
  In love this hand of mine,
And each in each shall be blest, my dear,
  In the land of love divine.
