"I Stand Beside a Lonely Grave" (16 Mar 1871)
Song & Chorus.
Words by Annie (Anna) M. Curtis.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I stand beside a lonely grave,
Where dewy lilies scent the air,
I hear a whisper soft and low,
That stirs my spirit like a prayer,
Alas that we were doomed to part,
Alas that any life should lose
The soothing sunshine of a heart,
Whose love is like the summer dews.

CHORUS
The angels claimed her all too soon,
And called her home to yonder clime;
I still have kept her mem'ry sweet,
She loved me in the summer time.

2.
'Neath yonder maple in the lane,
By trembling winds at twilight stirred;
Her tender lips caressed my cheek,
My heart was like a happy bird;
And tho' since then these aching feet,
Have strayed amid earth's dust and grime;
I still have kept her memory sweet,
She loved me in the summer time.

(CHORUS)

3.
I look for peace and rest in vain,
Where Autumn walks in sober gray;
For years and years of toil and pain,
Have stole the bloom from life away;
And now these eyes through shine and storm,
Are looking to yonder clime;
Where angels guard the gentle form,
Whose love was mine in summer time.

(CHORUS)
