"Our Country's in Danger and Calls for You Now" (1862)
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Come with your sabres and
Come with your guns,
Our country's in danger
and calls for her sons;
Stay not for the harvest,
Turn back from the plough,
Our Country's in danger
And calls for you now.

CHORUS 2 times
We're coming, (coming, coming,)
We are coming, (coming,  coming,)
We hear the loud cry
We'll rescue our Country
We'll save her or die.

2.
The flag of our Country's
Insulted and scorn'd,
Her laws are dishonor'd,
Her fair fame is wrong'd;
For dear mother land,
Oh! who would not die,
'Neath Freedom's proud banner,
And "Justice" the cry.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Oh! let us rekindle
The patriot fires,
That glow'd in the hearts
Of our brave old sires,
Our watchword is "freedom,"
And so we will fight,
For God and our Country,
The _truth_ and the _right_.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
Then come from the mountain
And come from the glen;
We'll drive the rebellion
Far back to its den;
Nay more, we'll destroy it,
That naught shall remain,
T'endanger the peace
Of our Country again.

(CHORUS 2 times)
