1. 
Bury them up in the silent years— 
Hopes that are dead, in their shroud of tears! 
Lay them away in the tender past, 
Where the sweet light of their life was cast: 
Tenderly bear them adown the way, 
Out of the light of the blessed day! 
Dear buried hopes of the days gone by! 
Dewed with our tears, let the darlings lie!

2. 
Loving we walked in the olden time, 
Thinking the way was a path divine, 
Dream ing the dreams of an Edenmorn, 
Blessing the love to our twin hearts born: 
You are still walking the golden way; 
Mine is a path through a bitter day; 
You through a beuutiful world of light, 
I through  the darkness and into night!

3. 
O, can there be for the aching heart,
Gleamings of hope that will ease its smart?
O is there light, and a better day
Ready to break on the darkened way?
Bury them tenderly— dear hopes dead!
They are enshrined in the tears we shed,
And o’er the spot where they softly sleep,
Lilies of love shall their odors weep.
