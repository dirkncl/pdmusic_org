1. It is not as it used to be
When you and I were young;
When round each elm and maple tree
The honeysuckles cling;
But still I love the cottage where
I passed my early years,
Though not a single face is there
That memory endears.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
But still I love the cottage where
I passed my early years,
Thought not a single face is there
That memory endears.

2. It is not as it used to be,
The moss is on the roof,
And from their nests beneath the eaves
The swallows keep aloof.
The robins— how they used to sing
When you and I were young;
And how did flit the wild bee’s wing
The opening flowers among!

3. It is not as it used to be;
The voices loved of yore,
The forms that we were wont to see,
We see and bear no more.
No more! Alas we look in vain,
For those to whom we clung
And loved as we can love but once,
When you and I were young.
