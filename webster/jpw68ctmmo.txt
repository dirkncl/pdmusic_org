1. 
Come to me memories olden, 
Out from the beautiful past! 
Show me the mysteries golden 
Locked in thy treasuries fast! 
Give me the gems in thy keeping, 
Let my heart wear them tonight! 
Long hath it walked in the darkness, 
Long hath it looked for the light. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come to me memories olden, (Olden,) 
Out from the beautiful past! (Beautiful past!)
Show me the mysteries golden (Golden), 
Locked in thy treasuries fast!

2. 
Give me the moments of meeting, 
Fraught with a pleasure untold, 
Give me the lip’s holy pressure,— 
Give me the ringlets of gold; 
Give me the vows that were whispered 
Under the beautiful sky, 
Give me the sunlight that gilded— 
Moments forever gone by. 

3. 
Give me the words that are silent! 
Give me the smile that is gone! 
Give me love’s earnest devotion! 
Give me love’s eloquent song! 
Thou hast my treasures— restore them 
Even in seeming to me! 
Come to me memories olden, 
Long have I waited for thee!
