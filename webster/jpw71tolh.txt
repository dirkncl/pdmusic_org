Words by Alice Cary, 1820-1871

1.
When steps are hurrying homeward,
And night the world o'er spreads,
And I see at the open window,
The shining of little heads,
And see at the open window,
The shining of little heads,
Then I thinl of you darling,
In your lonesome little beds,
Then I think of you my darling,
In your lonesome little beds.

CHORUS
But sometimes in sweet visions,
My faith to sight expands,
And with my babes in his bosom,
My Lord before me stands,
And I feel on my head bowed down so low,
The touches...the touches...of darling little hands,
The touches...the touches...of darling little hands.

2.
And when the latch is lifted,
And I hear the voices glad,
Then I feel my arms more empty,
My poor heart more wildly sad,
Then I feel my arms more empty,
My poor heart more wildly sad,
For we measure dearth of blessing,
By the blessings we have had,
For we measure dearth of blessing.

(CHORUS)

3.
Then pain is lost in patience,
And tears no longer flow,
They are lost but to the sorrow
And the sin of life I know,
They are lost but to the sorrow
And the sin of life I know,
For were they not immortal,
My love would make them so,
For were they not immortal,
My love would make them so.

(CHORUS)
