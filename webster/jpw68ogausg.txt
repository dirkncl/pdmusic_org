1. 
Ho! all ye patriot freemen 
  Who seek for leaders true, 
And every gallant soldier 
  That wore the Union blue, 
The Hero and the Statesman 
  Are just the men you want; 
Then bully for Old Glory 
  And General U. S. Grant!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah, and hurrah! 
  join in our song; 
We’re marching for the White House; 
  you better come along; 
With our Hero and our Statesman 
  they’re just the men we want; 
So bully for Old Glory 
  and President U. S. Grant!

2. 
The man who conquered treason,
  And never knew defeat,
For Equal Rights and Justice
  Will never sound retreat;
Sublime in modest silence;
  Where weaker men would rant;
Then bully for Old Glory,
  For Colfax and for Grant!

3. 
When Grant is in the White House,
  And Schuyler Colfax, then
What foreign power dare fetter
  Our weakest citizen?
Clear ’round the earth our motto
  Of “Human Rights” we’ll plant;
With bully for Old Glory
  And Uncle Samuel Grant.

4. 
Here toil need feel no fetters,
  No social bar or ban;
We chose amid our laborers
  The Nation’s Pattern Man!
No class to wield dominion,
  O’er loyal men to flaunt;
But bully for Old Glory
  And gallant U. S. Grant!

5. 
To Union, Right, and Freedom,
  We pledge our vows again;
Our flag of hope and glory
  Shall shelter none but men.
Then down with all oppression,
  And prejudice, and cant!
And bully for Old Glory,
  For Colfax and for Grant!
