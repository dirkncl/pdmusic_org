1. Touch us gently, gently, Time!
Let us glide adown thy stream
Gently as we sometimes glide
Through a quiet dream!
Humble voy’gers here are we—
Husband, wife and children three—
One is lost— an angel fled
To the azure overhead!

2. Touch us gently, gently Time!
We’ve not proud nor soaring wings;
Our ambition, our content,
Lies in humble, simple things.
Humble voy’gers still are We,
O’er Life’s dim unsounded sea,
Seeking only some calm clime;—
Touch us gently, gentle Time!
