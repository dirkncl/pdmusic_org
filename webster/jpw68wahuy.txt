1. We’ve a home up yonder,
When the sky is bright,
In the blessed mansions
Of the Lord of Light.

CHORUS [sung 2 times after each VERSE]
We've a home up yonder,
We’ve a home up yonder
We’ve a home up yonder,
In the starry sky.

2. Jesus went before us,
To prepare the way,
And his spirit guides us
To the realms of day!

3. We are omly pilgrims
While below we stay;
And our feet are walking
Up the starry way.
