1.
Come to me, dearest, the night-birds are singing,
  Come where I wait thee in silence alone,
Come while the stars their soft glances are flinging,
  From eyes that are only less bright than thine own.

CHORUS
Come to me, come to me,
Come to me, dearest,
Come without fear to the old trysting place;
Come to me, darling,
O, sweetest and fairest,
Come in thy purity, beauty and grace.


2.
Come to me, darling, the dewdrops are falling,
  Meet me to night in the fir-scented grove,
Come where the echoes so fondly are calling
  Wood nymphs and fairies to feasting's of love.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come to me, fairest, the soft wind is blowing,
  Gently thy fair cheek its breath will salute,
Come while its favors the night is bestowing,
  List to the low pleading voice of the lute.

(CHORUS)

4.
Come to me, sweetest, the round moon is shining,
  Crowning the earth with a halo of light,
Come where the fanciful shadows are twining,
  Come in thy beauty and purity bright.

(CHORUS)

5.
Come to me, loved one, the moments are flying,
  Come where the night blooming flowers unfold,
Come while  the world in deep slumber is lying,
  Come where a tale of true love can be told.

(CHORUS)
