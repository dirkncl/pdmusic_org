1. Little household Angel,
Sitting on the floor,
Playing at the window,
Peeping towards the door;
Listening, smiling, breathless,
For the ent’ring feet—
Oh! beloved baby,
What is half so sweet.
Innocent magician,
Whose enchanting wiles
Turn the children’s weeping
Into sunny smiles,
Charm the heart of sorrow,
Smooth the brow of care,
Oh! beloved baby,
What is half so sweet?

2. Yet how strangely sitteth
Gravity and grace,
With such mystic meaning,
On thine infant face;
Oh! our doveeyed darling,
Wherefore doest thou sigh?
Art thou only pining
For thy home on high?
Cannot all our loving
Make thee quite forget
Mansions whose oure glory
Linger round thee yet?
Tarry with us, Angel,
Messenger from heaven,
That for help and healing
Wast so kindly given.

3. Though we may not love thee
As they love thee there;
Though our home be darker
Than those mansions fair;
Yet we love the, baby,
With our utmost love—
Tarry with us, Angel,
Sent us from above.
