1.
A little frock but slightly worn,
Of blue and white delaine
With edgeing round the neck and sleeves,
Lay folded neat and plain;
Besides a pair of little shoes,
With here and there a flaw,
Lay half conceal’d among the things
In mothers bureau draw.
Lay half conceal’d among the things
In mothers bureau draw.

2.
The summer’d pass’d away from earth
With all its sweetest ties;
The birds had left their summer haunts,
For more congenial skies;
The twilight breezes softly play’d
Among the dews of even,­­
An angel left his home on high,
To gather flow’rs for Heav’n.
An angel left his home on high,
To gather flow’rs for Heav’n.

3.
The angel near and nearer came
Where sister, sick, did lie,
Then gently fanned her faded cheek,
And pointed to the sky;
The morning shone upon the bed,
The autumn wind blew free,
The angel moved his silver wings,
And whispered, “Come with me.”
The angel moved his silver wings,
And whispered, “Come with me.”

4.
We gathered round her dying bed,
With hearts to weep and pray;
And many were the tears we shed,
When sister went away.
No bitter tears has she to weep,
No sin to be forgiven;
But closed her little eyes in sleep
To open them in Heaven.
But closed her little eyes in sleep
To open them in Heaven.

5.
We laid her in the earth’s green breast,
Down by the village green,
Where gently sweeps the dew-y grass,
And summer flowers are seen;
And often when dear mother goes
To get her things to use,
I see her drop a silent tear,
On sister’s frock and shoes.
I see her drop a silent tear,
On sister’s frock and shoes.
