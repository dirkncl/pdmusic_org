1. Last sunmertime I gather’d flow’rs
  That bloom’d so fresh and fair,
And garlands wove in happy hours
  To deck my sister’s hair:
Together then we mov’d along
  Our quiet pleasant ways,
To gether then pour’d forth our song
  Of joy, or hymn of praise.
    Hark! “Lead me along;”
    Sister is singing: “Lead me along.”

2. O “Life was all one happy dream,”
  No clouds hung o’er my head;
’Round all my walks the bright sunbeam
  Its golden promise shed:
At home, abroad, or far, or near,
  What e’er my place or part.
My sister’s voice was in my ear,
  My sister in my heart.
    Hark! “Lead me along;”
    Sister is singing: “Lead me along.”

3. But now my dreams are vanished all;
  No more glad sunshine here—
These flow’rs are fading ’neath the pall
  That shrouds my sister’s bier.
It seems so sat that thou must go,
  Whose life had just begun,
“Not dead— but gone before,” and so,
  Oh Lord “Thy will be done.”
    Hark! “Lead me along;”
    Sister is singing: “Lead me along.”

4. So early called, O sister dear,
  To join the Heavenly throng—
So fondly thy last words I hear,
  “Dear ones lead me along.”
And now I prize all else above
  This faith— it hallows song:
That God in mercy, kindness, love,
  Still tends us all along.
    Hark! “Lead me along;”
    Sister is singing: “Lead me along.”

CHORUS [sung after last VERSE]
And now farewell oh! dear young heart—
Farewell, but not forever.
We’ll meet you bye and bye up there,
Beyond the mystic River:
No sorrow’s there, and Death’s cold hand
No ties of love shall sever,
Where flowers bloom and angels sing
Around the blest forever.
