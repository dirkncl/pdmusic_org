                         PREFACE.

  In presenting this little work to the public, its authors
hope that its merits will commmend it to all lovers of the
Sunday School.  Sacred music is the handmaiden of Religion;
singing must always occupy a prominent place in devotional
excercise; and in no place has it more direct and telling
influence than in the Sunday School, where the young mind,
actively susceptible to impression, is being molded.  Hence
the importance that should be attached to this excercise,
and the care that should be observed in selection.  Every-
thing in this book, with less than a half dozen exceptions,
has been written expressly for it, and the few selections
are tunes that long use has proved to be good.  Nothing of
a light and trashy nature nature has been admitted--the aim
being to so wed words and music, as to inspire the genuine
spirit of devotion, and lead the young soul, by paths of
pleasantness, up to the very fountain of revealed religion.
