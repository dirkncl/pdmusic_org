1. A willow’s drooping branches,
  With a quiet, solemn grace,
Are softly, gently swaying,
  O’re a lone, sequester’d place.
’Tis a perfect bower of beauty,
  Yet with grief too deep to tell,
We laid our darling there to rest,
  Our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.

CHORUS 1
’Tis is perfect bower of beauty,
  Yet with grief too deep to tell,
We laid our darling there to rest,
  Our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.

2. The birds are gaily singing,
  Near this little spot of ground;
Bright blooming flow’rs are shedding,
  Their perfume all around.
Birds and flow’rs are now unheeded,
  Although she loved them well;
She is sleeping, calmly sleeping,
  Is our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.

CHORUS 2
Birds and flow’rs are now unheeded,
  Although she loved them well;
She is sleeping, calmly sleeping,
  Is our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.

3. Alas! how much we miss her,
  Through the longlong summer days;
And more than all we miss her,
  When wrapped in autumn haze
In the place where she is resting,
  Yet we may not break its spell;
We shall meet again in heaven,
  Our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.

CHORUS 3
In the place where she is resting,
  Yet we may not break its spell;
We shall meet again in heaven,
  Our bonnie, bonnie blueeyed Nell.
