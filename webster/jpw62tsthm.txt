1. 
When the tide of death had drifted,
And our braves had fought so well,
Now the battle cloud was lifted,
And the gentle starlight fell;
There the darling of his mother,
Weary, fainting, wounded lay;
At his side a soldier brother
Knelt to hear what he might say.

2. 
“Tell my mother, when you see her,
That I fell as fall the brave,
And she must not let it grieve her
That I fill an unknown grave,—
For the gentle dews of heaven
By the spot for her will weep,
And the holy stars of even
O’er me faithful vigils  keep.”

3. 
“In the  long and weary marches,
’Neath a burning Southern sky,
Watching in the dark, damp marshes,
Where so many comrades lie;
’Twas thy love sustained me, mother,
’Twas thy spirit made me brave,
And I kissed our dear flag, mother,
Pledging life its stars to save.”

4. 
“You may take this little token,—
’Tis a ring she used to wear;
And as yet it is not broken,
So the love to her I hear,—
Take it safely back to mother,
Bid her wear it now for me,—
She must prize it as no other,
For my lovepledge it shall be”

5. 
Am I in a happy dreaming?
Let me grasp again your hand!
Is that light the golden gleaming
Of the blessed promis’d land?
Are you near me now, my mother?
On my ear your secrets fell,—
Kiss your darling boy, dear mother,—
I must leave you— fare you well.”
