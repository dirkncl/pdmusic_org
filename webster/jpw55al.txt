1.
'Tis now the merry month of May;
When skies and fields are fair,
The birds pour forth their rounde lay,
And fragrant is the air;
But Spring can bring no joyous hours,
As once it did to me,
For oh! she perished with the flow'rs,
My peerless Annie Lee.

2.
I seek the grove at eventide
Where we so often met,
To wander sweetly side by side,
Ere we had known regret,
And oft her flute like voice I hear,
As when she sang to me,
And oh I love to think her near,
My sainted Annie Lee!

3.
Twas there I told my guiless love,
And there she breathed her vow,
And though she dwells in bliss above,
She seems beside me now.
I see a form so heavenly bright,
That sweetly smiles on me,
And well I know though robed in light,
My peerless Annie Lee!

4.
Let others hail the light of May,
When skies and fields are fair,
And birds pour forth their rounde lay,
And fragrant is the air;
But all the bliss of vernal hours,
That e'er returns to me,
Is when I strew with early flow'rs
The grave of Annie Lee!
