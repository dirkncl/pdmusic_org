1. Cull sweet violets, blushing roses,
  Ev’ry bud I love the best;
Bring me flowers, fragrant flowers,
  Place them on my aching breast.
Bring me flowers, fragrant flowers,
  Place them on my aching breast.

CHORUS 1
Strike the harp in wildest numberts
  Sing the songs you sung of yore;
Give me music, heav’n born music,
  Let my soul be calm once more,
Then strike the harp in wildest numbers,
  Sing the songs you sung of yore,
Give me music, heav’n born music,
  Let my soul be calm once more.

2. Sing of home and all its beauties,
  Dasies meads, and flowing streams;
Scenes of childhood, happy childhood,
  Oft I visit thee in dreams.
Scenes of childhood, happy childhood,
  Oft I visit thee in dreams.

CHORUS 2
Strike the hapr in soothing numbers
  Sing once more the well know strains;
I am weeping, wildly weeping
  But my soul is calm again,
Then strike the harp in soothing numbers,
  Sing once more that well known strain,
I am weeping, wildly weeping
  But my soul is calm again.
