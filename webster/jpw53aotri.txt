1.
Oh call us not back to the festtival board, 
To the gay lighted halls where the wine cup is poured; 
We come  not, we heed not from fountain and rill.
We fill up the goblet and drink to you still.

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
We drink to the hour when like us you shall be,
With the heart of the brave in the home of the free;
We drink to the home where our banner shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

2.
We drink to the hour when like us you shall be,
With the heart of the brave in he home of the free;
We drink to the hour when our banner shall wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

3.
We turn from the revel, the banquet, the song,
To the home and the fireside deserted so long;
And there every friend so long banished shall be,
To greet us returning, the ransomed, the free.

4.
Oh call us not back to the festival board,
To the gay lighted hall, where the wine cup is poured,
For sorrow and gloom to its portals belong,
And the deathknell of hope is the bacchanal’s song.
