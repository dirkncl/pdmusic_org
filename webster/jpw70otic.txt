"Our Turn Is Coming" (2 Dec 1870)
Song & Chorus.
Words by L. J. Bates.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875.

1.
In ev'ry life same rain must beat;
In ev'ry life some sunshine is;
Some early taste their share of sweet;
Some longer, longer wait their bliss.
Then weep no more the wasted years.
And mourn no more the long delay;
Be patient till our joy appears;
Our turn must come, must come some day.

CHORUS
For it's coming, (coming coming)
coming, (comming coming)
coming, (comming coming)
Our turn is coming, (coming comming)
coming, is near;
Though darkness and sorrow
Belong 'ere the morrow
Still our turn is coming, (coming coming)
nev- (-er never) -er (nerver) fear,
Still our turn is coming, (coming coming)
nev- (-ev never) -er (never) fear,
never fear, never fear.

2.
For vain are tears for sorrows past,
And vain are fears for future ill,
While plighted troth holds sure and fast,
And love, and love is faithful still.
Then envy not the happy hearts,
Whose crowns of joy do not delay;
The bliss late coming late departs,
And ours, and ours will longer stay.

(CHORUS)

3.
The flower of summer's early rain,
Is sure to droop in summer's glow;
The year's best gifts of golden grain
Lie green, lie green beneath the snow.
Then doubt no-more our lives shall bloom,
For sorrow cannot always stay;
And for the happy time to come,
'Twill be, 'twill be our turn some day.

(CHORUS)
