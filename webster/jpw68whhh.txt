1.
With humble, hopeful heart,
To thee Oh God I pray;
Let not thy love depart,
But guide me on my way.

2.
Temptations may assail,
Ere I the prize can win,
Unless thy grave prevail,
To shelter me from sin.

3.
Let not my youthful feet
In paths of error stray!
Straight is the road, and steep,
That leads to perfect day.

4.
I look for strength above;
Be thou my constant friend,
And guide me by thy love,
Where pleasures never end.
