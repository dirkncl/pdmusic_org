1. When I was young, and you were young, 
  Janette, my own Janette,—
When merriment was on the tongue,
  And eyes were seldom wet;
Ah! How I lov’d my darling one,
  Redcheek’d and laughing-eyed!
In all the lands beneath the sun
  Who had a fairer bride?

[CHORUS 1-3]
My white-hair’d bride!— my patient wife!
  Our barque of youth is wrecked, wrecked;
Yet will I, on this shoal of life,
  “Love, cherish, and protect.”

2. Nor ever summer sunshine fell
  More brightly than your hair,
Nor could the tales that poets tell
  With you gay smile compare,
How loved we one another then!
  How glad we were in heart!
How now at threescore years and ten
  How quick the tears will start!

3. For I was young and you was young,
  Janette, my own Janette,—
Nor are your tresses bright as gold,
  Your lips like crimson yet;
For you have kissed the brow of calm,
  Sung resignation’s psalm,
But underneath your snowy hair,
  Your brow is very calm.
