1.
Sweetly ring the Sabbath bells,
Sounding o'er the hills and dells;
Chiming sweetly loud and clear
Charmingly they greet the ear.
Sabbath bells, sweet Sabbath bells,
List the tale their music tells.

2.
Children love the Sabbath bells,
Know the tale their music tells;
Borne upon the evening air,
Calling to the house of prayer.
Sabbath bells, sweet Sabbath bells,
List the tale their music tells.

3.
Hasten o'er the pleasant way!
Light will be our hearts to day,
When we meet together there,
In the pleasant hous of prayer.
Sabbath bells, sweet Sabbath bells,
List the tale their music tells.
