"Onward" (1858)
(Quartette.)
from "Songs of the Land of Sunset"
Poetry by Hebron Bell
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Unfurl the standard to the breeze;
Raise the glorious ensign high;
Shout! aloud for victory,
Onward! is the battle cry;
Onward! thro' the deep'ning gloom
Gathers thickly on our way,
Soon will vanish all the darkness
At the breaking of the day.
Soow will vanish all the darkness,
At the breaking of the day.

2.
Slander's flood around us dashing,
Seeks to overwhelm the soul--
Sorrow's deep and chafing billows
At our feet may madly roll,
But regardless of our danger,
Fix on faith the quiv'ring eye,
Gazing only in the future
Onward! shout the battle-cry,
Gazing only in the future,
Onward! shout the battle-cry.
3.
Onward pressing, turning never
From the path that leads to fame --
Onward! upward never tiring,
We will win ourselves a name;
And as clouds around us gather
Let us raise the shout on high,
While the distant hills re-echo
Onward! 'tis our battle-cry.
While the distant hills re-echo
Onward! 'tis our battle-cry.
