"Jessie Darling Come in Dreams" (1873)
Words by Sanford Fillmore Bennett, 1836-1898
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Jessie, darling, come in dreams,
When the moon is beaming,
When the light of tender stars,
O'er the earth is streaming --
Come and sing me soft and low,
Sweet loves tender numbers,
Till the bliss of heaven draws near,
Near me in my slumbers.

CHORUS [overlapping voices]
[SOPRANO and ALTO]
Oh Come, come, come love, come,
Jessie, darling, come in dreams,
When the moon is beaming,
And the light of all silver stars,
O'er the world is streaming.
[TENOR and BASS]
For my heart goes out to thee, love,
Dreaming, darling, dreaming,
Jessie, darling come in dreams, come in dreams,
When the moon is beaming,
When the moon is beaming,
And the light of the silver stars,
And the light of the silver stars,
O'er all the world is streaming.

2.
Jessie, darling, come in dream,
For my heart is waiting,
As the song bird last in sleep
Waits the morning breaking,
Come and reign the queen and source
Of my dreamland glory,
While I whisper you again
Sweet love's olden story.

(CHORUS)

3.
Jessie, darling, comes in dreams,
For the dawning morrow,
With its rosy tinted skies,
May bring only sorrow;
But the dreamland tree of love
Is no shaddow casting,
And its flow'rs are fair and sweet,
Tho' they be not lasting.

(CHORUS)
