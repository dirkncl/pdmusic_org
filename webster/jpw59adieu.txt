		These very sad and melancholy lines were written by Robert 
Burns in 1787 and presented to the Brethren of St. James lodge of 
Tarbulton, (Scotland) as a token of his continued brotherly love and 
esteem, in the full belief, that he should never meet them more on 
earth.
		I have attempted to set them to appropriate music;— and 
while I humbly trust it will merit the appropriation of the true 
lovers of song generally, I do, with hearty regard, and sheerest 
respect, dedicate to the pure and good, of that world-wide and 
world-renowned Brotherhood.					J. P. W.

SONG 1. Adieu! a heartwarm fond adiew,
 Dear brothers of (the mystic tie!)
Ye favour’d, ye enlighend few;
  Companions of my social joy!
Tho’ I to foreign lands must hie,
  Pursuing fortune’s slipp’ry ba’,
With melting heart and brimful eye.
  I’ll mind you still tho’ far awa’.

SONG 2. Oft have I met your social band
  And spent the cheerful, festive night!
Oft honour’d with supreme command
  Precided o’er the (sons of light)
And by that (hieroglyphic) bright,
  Which none but (craftsmen) ever saw!
Strong mem’ry on my heart shall write
  Those happy scenes when far awa’.

SONG 3. May freedom, harmony and love,
  Unite you in the grand design,
Beneath omniscient eye above,
  The glorious Architect divine!
That you may keep th’unerring line,
  Still rising by the plummet’s law,
Till order bright completely shine,
  Shall be my pray’r when far awa’.

SONG 4. And you farewell! whose merits claim,
  Justly, that highest badge to wear!
Heav’n bless your honour’d, noble name,
  To masonry and Scotia dear!
A last request permit me here,
  When yearly ye assemble a’,
One round, I ask it with a tear,
  To him, the bard that’s far awa’.
