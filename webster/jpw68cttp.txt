"Come Take the Pledge" (1868)
Song and Chorus.
Words Sanford Fillmore Bennett, 1836-1898
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Come, take the pledge, and drink no more
The ruby cup of tempting wine,
For sin and death in the bowl,
And gloomy days, and deeds of crime!

CHORUS
Come take the pledge, come take the pledge,
Come take the pledge with me, (Take the pledge)
Come take the pledge with me, dear friends,
Come take the pledge with me.

2.
Come take the pledge; the water pure,
that gushes from the cooling spring,
Will hope, and happiness, and peace,
And length of days, and blessing bring.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come take the pledge, and join with me
The earnest working temperance band!
The world has need of such as thou,
And claims the father of thy hand.

(CHORUS)
