1. 
Sweet were the dreams when far away, 
O sweet were my dreams of thee! 
In the midnight hour and the blaze of day,
 My only thoughts were of thee. 
I dreamed alas! we were forced to part, 
Then sad was my dream of thee. 
I wander’d forth with a broken heart, 
O sad was my dream of thee.

2. 
I dreamt again: Thou wert by my side, 
And sweetly smil’d on me, 
I thought thou wert pledged to be my bride, 
O! sweet were my dreams of thee. 
And all my dreams were not in vain, 
For true thou hast proved to be. 
I hail thee now as mine own fair bride; 
And sweet were my dreams of thee.
