"Drifting" (1872)
Words by Faustine
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
The sweet day is dying,
The soft winds are sighing,
The shadows are kissing the mountain and shore,
But sunlight still lingers,
With magical fingers,
And touches to glory the sky bending o'er.

CHORUS
Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful,
Drifting and dreaming we ever may sleep,
Ever may sleep.

2.
And watching its gleaming,
We fall in to dreaming,
As o'er the bright waters at sunset we glide,
And drifting, and drifting,
The oars scarcely lifting,
We float in our dreaming along with the tide.

(CHORUS)

3.
Forgetting all sorrow,
Inheeding the morrow,
Our cares lulled to rest be the murmuring deep
The prayer is half spoken --
The dream be unbroken,
That drifting and dreaming we ever may sleep.

(CHORUS)
