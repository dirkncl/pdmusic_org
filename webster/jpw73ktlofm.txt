"Kiss the Little Ones for Me" (1873)
Words by Eben Eugene Rexford, 1848-1916
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
When evening cometh downward
On wings of shadowy gloom,
And in our little cottage
The shadows fill the room
Then when our little children
Kneel down beside your knee,
To say their goodnights over
Oh! kiss them all for me.

CHORUS
Yes kiss the little children
That gather by your knee,
To say their goodnights over,
Oh! kiss them all for me.
To say their goodnights over,
Oh! kiss them all for me.

2.
The miles are long between us,
Those little ones and me,
But always in the twilight,
Each little face I see,
I see their hands, close folded,
In prayer upon your knee,
And whisper to the breezes,
"Go! kiss them all for me!"

(CHORUS)

3.
I think my babes are singing
Their little evening hymn,
And my heart grows very tender,
My eyes grow strangely dim.
God bless my little darlings
About their mother's knee,
And kiss them, as you leave them,
A sweet good night for me!

(CHORUS)
