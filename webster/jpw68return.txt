1.
Return to thy father, O wanderer return!
For thee doth his bosom with love fondly burn;
He waits to receive thee in welcoming arms,
And quiet thy heart in its wildest alarms.

CHORUS
He is gentle and kind, his salvation is free,
And he holds out his hand in a welcome to thee,
He is gentle and kind, his salvation is free,
And he holds out his hand in a welcome to thee.

2.
Return to thy father, why longer delay?
The offers of mercy are open today!
And rich is the table that Christ doth prepare
For those who return to his fatherly care!

(CHORUS)

3.
Afar off, when coming, His eye shall discern
The prodigal son who would humbly return;
The ring of his love on thy hand thou shalt bear,
And robes of forgiveness in joy thou shalt wear.

(CHORUS)
