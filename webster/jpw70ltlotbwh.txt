1. The birds had returned from their far northern homes 
Where orange grove perfumes had lured them away, 
And builded their nests mid the apple tree blooms, 
Whose fragrance ambrosial enveloped our May. 
The young spring had burst from old winter’s embrace, 
And gladdened the eye with a glory most rare, 
But fairer than all was the beautiful face
Of Lizzie, the lass of the brown wavy hair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The spring time returns with its newly born blooms, 
And fragrance and song fill the slumberous air; 
But wasted are bird notes and sweetest perfumes, 
For gone is the lass of the brown wavy hair.

2. The birds sang their sweetest among the green trees, 
The gentlest of zephyrs fanned forehead and cheek, 
The velvety verdure with each passing breeze, 
And ripple voiced carols enchanted the creek; 
The sunlight of spring time pervaded the scene, 
And promise of summer time dwelt in the air, 
But a far brighter vision came ever between, 
’Twas Lizzie, the lass of the brown wavy hair.

3. ’Twas long, long ago, in the dear buried past, 
The rapturous morning beneath the blue sky: 
The glorious vision was too bright to last, 
For love[']s the most precious first [to] wither and die. 
’Twas long, long ago, and this radiant maid, 
Than sunshine and springtime and flowers more fair, 
Was ’neath the green turf in her purity laid, 
All, all but this tress of her brown wavy hair.
