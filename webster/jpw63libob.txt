1. 
Hail, Columbia’s natal day!
Hail men of glorious memory,
Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,
For human rights and equal laws.
Be independence still our boast,
Bequeath’d to us at such a cost—
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its altars reach the skies.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Firm, united let us be,
Rallying round our liberty!
As a band of brothers joined,
Peace and freedom we shall find.

2. 
Sons of patriots, mark the hour—
Again the storms of battle low’r,
And treason stalks,— then “on the brave!”
Defend the boon your fathers gave—
“The world’s last hope;” in cause so just,
In Heaven we put a manly trust,
That right shall evermore prevail,
And ev’ry scheme of bondage fail.

3. 
Sound the clarion trump again—
Resound our warriors’ deeds of fame,
Till ev’ry clime, to freedom dear,
Shall answer with a joyful tear.
With courage, skill, and hands of might,
They march, the champions legions cease
Nor shall their conquering legions cease
Till  rebels sue for pardon— peace.

4. 
Hail to the chief who now commands,
Who for his country firmly stands
To breast the storm— with purpose true,
His faith abides in heaven and you.
When hope was sinking in dismay,
When gloom obscured the nations’s day,
His potent voice, with firm decreee,
Proclaimed the dawn of LIBERTY.
