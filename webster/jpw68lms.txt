1. Lead me, Savior, Lead me, Savior,
In the way that I should tread!
Let thy grace in ample measure
Rest in blessing on my head.
Young am I, and need assistance,
From thy good and loving hand,
All the long and weary distance
To the blessed Promised Land..

2. Stand, O stand beside me, Savior,
You alond, my strength shall be!
Give to me that sacred pleasure—
Love to all mankind and thee.
I shall walk if thou will guide me,
Up the narrow, shining way,
And at last sit down beside thee
In the land of perfect day.
