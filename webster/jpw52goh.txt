1.
Green old hills! our country's glory,
  Proudly in the midst ye stand,
Linked with many a sweet old story--
  Theme of many a minstrel band.
Northward, southward, broadly stretching
  Where the Susquehanna gleams
Through Virginia's land of beauty,
  Far away to Southern streams.

2.
Here the dusky hunters proudly
  Chased the deer in days gone by,
Here the mountain echoes loudly
  Woke the warrior's battle-cry,
Here the white invader boldly
  Drove him from his haunts away,
And the winds are sighing sadly
  While he takes his westward way.

3.
Green old hills of Alleghany,
  Oh! to climb your heights once more!
Westward lie the mighty rivers,
  Eastward frowns the Atlantic shore.
Oh! with proud heart bounding wildly
  On yon highest cliff to stand!
While Columbia's sweetest vallies
  Sleep beyond, on either hand.

4.
Green old hills, our country's glory
  We will proudly sing your praise,
You shall be the theme of story,
  Wake the minstrel's sweetest lays.
Fate may bid our footsteps wander,
  Yet for each spirit thrills,
Naught our faithful hearts shall sunder
  From our country's green old hills!
