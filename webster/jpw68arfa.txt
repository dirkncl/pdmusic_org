1. 
Ho! men of the far sunny southland; 
Ho! men of the free breathing North,— 
Of eastland, and westland, and midland,— 
Who proudly to battle went forth;— 
Awake! from the slumbers that bind ye, 
List, list to the voices that call; 
There’s work to be done by the bravest, 
If _Vict’ry_ means, _All rights for all!_

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The Nation is saved! the Republic is free! 
Adieu to the musket and sabre; 
Our cry shall now be from the hills to the sea, 
ALL RIGHTS FOR FREE MEN AND FREE LABOR!

2. 
The Nation is saved,— reunitted, 
The dark stain of slavery gone; 
Through wounding and scars, Truth has triumphed, 
And Duty now beckons us on. 
We pity our poor “erring sisters,” 
And Mercy may weep o’er their fall; 
But Justice, the blind maiden goddess, 
Insists upon _All rights for all!_

3. 
The Republic is free,— democratic,— 
No monarch may dictate our laws 
The great sov’reign people do battle, 
Or ballot in Liberty’s cause; 
Intol’rance is now out of fashion, 
Butied, deep beneath slav’ry’s pall,— 
All hall! the new civ ilization, 
Which now demands _All rights for all!_

4. 
O, men whom the people have trusted, 
The status of Freedmen to fix. 
Remember the great Declaration, 
By the Fathers in seventysix; 
In Godgiven rights, we are equal, 
Man, woman, whiteblack, great and small,— 
Then legalizse im partial suffrage, 
And guaranty _All rights for all!_
