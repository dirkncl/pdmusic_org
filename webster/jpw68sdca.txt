1. Summer days, come again-- come in thy glory,
Come with thy roses and violets fair,
Come with the breeze and the bird's winsome story,
Come with the garlands thy sunny hours wear.

2. Summer days, come again: long we have waited,
Counting the hours of the tarrying time,
Mourning thee almost, a stranger belated,
In thy long flight from a sunnier clime.

3. Summer days, come again-- all the sweet flowers
Out in the fields of snow shrouded and dead.
Waiting thy touch are the deolate bowers,
Mourning the day that the sweet sunshine fled.

4. Summer days, come again-- woodland and meadow,
Lowliest shrub and the loftiest tree,
Sleep in the dark of the cold winter's shadow,
Waiting the kiss of the sunshine and thee.

[CODA*]
Summer days, come again-- come in thy glory,
Come with thy roses and violets fair.

[* the score's end is marked "Use the first two lines of the
first verse for D. C." which could be meant as a final CODA or
perhaps to be a REFRAIN used after _each_ verse of the first
two lines _of_ each verse repeated]
