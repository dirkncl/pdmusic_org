"When I Courted Mary Ann" (1871)
Words by Alfred Sully
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I remember long ago when I courted Mary Ann,
  When she told me that she loved me more than any other man,
How she laid her flaxen ringlets close against my heaving breat,
  You may know 'twas mighty pleasant,
You may know 'twas mighty pleasant,
You may know 'twas mighty pleasant,
  And I needn't tell the rest.

2.
Of the evenings in the parlor and the meetings in the street,
  And the kisses on the stairway by my faith! but they were sweet;
Then the charming little letters that were always sent to me
  When we parted for a journey,
When we parted for a journey,
When we parted for a journey
  whether long or short to be.

3.
With her head upon my shoulder and her little hand in mine,
  You may bet we didn't reckon on the passing of the time;
Oft she'd tell me midst her blushes that she thought so much of me,
  And I fear it made me prouder
And I fear it made me prouder
And I fear it made me prouder
  than a mortal man should be.

4.
I remeber I was working building houses at the time,
  But the airy, fairy castles that I builded were sublime.
For my mind was always running on the girl that loved me so
  And at last I found I couldn't
And at last I found I couldn't
And at last I found I couldn't
  do without her as you know.

5.
Though I know it's mighty pleasant to be settled down for life,
  Yet it's twenty times as pleasant to be courting for a wife,
Of the happy, happy days, when I courted Mary Ann!
  So go on you courting youngsters
So go on you courting youngsters
So go on you courting youngsters
  and enjoy it while you can.
