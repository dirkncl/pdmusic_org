1. The grass is growing on the turf
  Where Willie sleeps,
Among the flow’ers we’ve planted there,
  The soft wind creeps.
We laid him there in wintertime,
  The frost was on the air;
The frost was on our hearts that day—
  And thus we left him there.

CHORUS 1-3 [with overlapping voices]
Sleep on dear, Willie sleep,
  Sleep on,
Sleep on dear, Willie sleep, 
  Sleep on,
Sleep on dear, Willie sleep, 
  Sleep on.

2. We left him there, but not alone,
  For God was nigh,
He dwelleth in the cold, cold ground,
  As in the sky,
That pitying One was near us, too,
  Else ev’ry hope had died;
He pitied our pour hearts, amd threw
  His smile across the tide.

3. Farewell, dear Willie for today,
  But not for aye;
Tomorrow with its “Life— beyond”
  Is very nigh.
Then, hearts long severed here in earth,
  And creased with care and grief,
Shall feel the bliss of that New Birth
  Which brings for all, relief.
