1. 
Aye, fling out the dear old banner, 
Let it float upon the breeze, 
Ev’ry star and stripe resplendent 
With our crowning victories; 
In the fearful front of battle, 
Firm it stood when death did come, 
Now to peace, it waves a welcome 
To our soldiers marching home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then rally from the woodland, 
the hillside, and the glen; 
A nation offers homage, 
to its best and bravest men; 
They have fought our country’s battles, 
and their work is nobly done, 
Now hurrah for our brave soldiers, 
and the vict’ry they have won.

2. 
In the hour of greatest danger,
When the storm was raging high,
At the time when MEN were needed,
Men of NERVE to do or die,
When the crested waves of treason
Threatened most our ship of state,
There the men who sprang to rescue
From the dread impending fate.

3. 
Many miles of toilsome marching,
Many hardships they’ve endured;
By their steady mathless valor,
Was our Nation’s life secured;—
Ah! the bright eyes closed forever—
Ah! the hearts that may not come—
Bless them Father, where they slumber,
Bless these whom we welcome home.

4. 
Shout! ye people— thunder, cannon!
Greet the heroes of the war;
Time nor space shall dim their laurels,
Glory gleams from ev’ry scar.
O, how gaily marched our brothers
Oh! how sad that some must fall;
Rest ye brave— rest, great commander—
Deathless fame awaits ye all.
