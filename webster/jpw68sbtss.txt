1.
Stand by the Sabbath school,
Comrades all, comrades all
Stand by the Sabbath school,
Hark! the call, hark! the call,
Here we find salvation's treasure
Here is blessing without measure,
And a wealth of rarest pleasure,
On us does fall.

2.
Stand by the Sabbath school,
Parents kind, parents kind;
Grace in the Sabbath school,
You will find, you will find,
With the bread of heaven feed us,
In the path of virtue lead us,
For the work of God will need us,
Bear this in mind.

3.
Stand by the Sabbath school,
Teachers dear, teachers dear;
We will obey each rule,
Never fear, never fear;
Happy we to day to meet you,
Lesson learned we gladly greet you,
With respect and love to treat you,
Teachers so dear!

4.
Stand by the Sabbath school,
Young and old, young and old,
Love, love the Sabbath School,
More than gold, more than gold,
Hither come with smiling faces,
Sunny hearted take your places,
Longing for the Christian graces,
God can unfold.
