"Oh How I Love My Mountain Home" (1852)
by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875
(from "New Series: Song and Quartettes
of the Alleghanians", No. 4 of 6)

[SOLO]
O how I love my mountain home,
its woodland hills, and murm'ring rills,
'Twas there my infant feet did roam,
along its paths and o'er its hills.
Ah! then I had a mother dear
to guide my youthful feet a right;
When ill befell to shed a tear,
and point me to a source of light.
[DUETT]
And then the stars shone brighter too,
As they bedeck'd the dark blue sky,
The rainbow tints of golden hue
were ever ever flitting gailey gaily bye.
[CHORUS]
Then give oh, give me back my mountain home,
its woodland hils and murm'ring rills,
For there alone I wish to roam,
among its rocks and o'er its hills.
Give o give me back my home,
My own dear my native home.
Home ... O give me back my mountain home.
