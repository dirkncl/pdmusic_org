1. One little heart has ceased to beat,
  One little voice is still—
The joyous sound of little feet
  No more our home shall fill:
Those eyes which lighted ev’ry room,
  And beamed with truth and love,
Are closed, as closes springtime gloom
  The sweet young flowers above.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Listen! the winter wind sadly is sighing,
  Lightly is falling the feathery snow;
Soon where are darlings together are lying,
  Sweet flowers shall blossom, and summer winds blow.

2. One week hath wrought a wondrous change;
  Then time sped swiftly on;—
The old familiar house seems strange—
  The light of life is gone:
No more is seen that childish form,
  Nor felt the winsome grace
Which kept our hearts so fresh and warm,
  And fill’d life’s brightest space.

3. We see around his playthings all—
  The skates he used to wear;
His books and belt, his bat and ball,
  Are lying silent there;
It seems that he should soon be here,
  He cannot be afar—
He must be coming, must be near,
  For here his treasures are.

4. Oh! deep the griefs our hearts have known—
  How can such sorrows be!
Life’s journey seems so drear and lone
  Without his company:
The winter winds’ lamenting blow
  Across the fields he trod;
His drear form lies beneath the snow,
  His spirit gone to God.
