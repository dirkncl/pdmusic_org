1. When winter’s winds were roaring loud,
  And snow was falling fast,
I sat before the cheerful blaze
  And dream’d that in the blast
My darling boy walk’d sentinel,
  Upon his weary round,
Or slept beneath a soldier’s tent,
  Upon the cold hard ground. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[overlapping voices]
[SA]
Dreaming on thro’ all the seasons,
Glad springtime brings me no joy,
Wintry, wintry
[TB]
Dreaming, dreaming on thro’ all the seasons,
Glad springtime, glad springtime brings me no joy,
Wintry, wintry clouds,
[SATB]
in dreamland hover,
Darkly round my blue-eyed boy.


2. The spring nights came with clouded sky,
  And then I dream’d again,
I dreamt that far from friendly camp,
  My boy stood in the rain;
His locks were dripping, dripping wet,
  And cold was ev’ry limb,
Oh full of dreams are rainy nights,
  But all are dreams of him.

3. The summer came with scented flower,
  And wild birds’ song and bee,
It brought the blushing rose for one,
  A thorn it gave to me;
I dreamt that in the Hospital,
  Where soldiers go to die,
I saw a boy whom I had known,
  For bright blue was his eye.


4. Now autumn winds are sighing loud
  O’er fields of yellow corn,
And still I dream the hours away,
  From eve till early dawn;
I dream that in the battle’s smoke,
  Or lying with the slain,
I see my pet, my darling boy,
  My blue eyed boy again.
