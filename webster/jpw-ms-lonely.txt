1. Lonely, Lonely! my heart sobs the livelong day!
Lonely, Lonely, It whispers and swains alway.
Lonely, Lonely! It whispers and swains alway.
Buried are all my heart held dear.
In dust and ashes they lie;
While lone I pursue life’s pathway drear, 
Alone, alone must I die.
[CHORUS]
Buried are all my heart held dear.
In dust and ashes they lie;
While lone I pursue life’s pathway drear, 
Alone, alone must I die.



2. Lonely, Lonely! once I was blithe and gay.
Lonely, Lonely, The sunlight has fled away.
Grief over my spirit her pall has flung;
Shadows encompass my brow.
And when all I  held when life was young, 
Nothing is left me now.
[CHORUS]
Grief over  my spirit her pall has flung;
Shadows encompass my brow.
And when all I  held when life was young, 
Nothing is left me now.



3. Weary, Weary! thus must I ever be?
Weary, Weary, No, _there is rest for me_.
Far in that land of love and light— 
Far o’er the crytal sea.
Where loving hearts will rest tonight,  
There, there is rest for me.
[CHORUS]
Far in that land of love and light— 
Far o’er the crytal sea.
Where loving hearts will rest tonight,  
There, _there_ is rest for me.
