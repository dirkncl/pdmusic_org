"Brave Men Behold Your Fallen Chief" (1861)
Tribute to Elsworth
Words by H. C. Ballard
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Dead! Dead! Dead at the dawning of the strife!
Dead! Dead! and late so loyal, brave and true;
When high hopes center'd in his life,
And fond eyes had his fame in view,
Elsworth, Elsworth, Elsworth, the noble, brave and true.
Elsworth, Elsworth, Elsworth, Dear departed, brave and true.

CHORUS
Enfold him in the stripes and stars,
He will not dim the brightest beam,
His blood will tinge the crimson bars,
Add richer lustre to its gleam.

And let word of censure fall,
Let those who scorn the world's applause,
Know well he went at duty's call,
And perish'd in his country's cause.

Enfold him in the stripes and stars,
He will not dim the brightest beam,
His blood will tinge the crimson bars,
Add richer lustre to its gleam.

2.
Brave men, behold your fallen chief!
Whose love your hearts will keep in trust,
Our tears will mingle with our grief,
Strike down the traitors to the dust.

CHORUS
Sleep on, brave heart, the flag they bore,
Thro' all the land at last shall wave,
Your bold Zouaves, when war is o'er,
Will plant that banner on you grave.

Sleep on, brave heart, the flag they bore,
Thro' all the land at last shall wave,
Your bold Zouaves, when war is o'er,
Will plant that banner on you grave.
