"Uncle Sam's Boys" (1862)
Words by Sanford Fillmore Bennett
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
Who are the heroes that dare the cannon's thunder?
Who are the brave hearts that face its iron balls
Marhcing to victory legions without number,
Ranks true and steady and souls that never quail!

CHORUS
Uncle Sam's boys, hip, hip, hurrah!
Uncle Sam's boys, hurrah, hurrah!
[Overlapped voices]
|: Uncle Sam's boys,
   [Falter! they were never known to,]
   Uncle Sam's boys, Will
   [But united, they are sworn to]
   die, or rebellion they will quell. :|

2.
Onward they came when their country's peril called them
Shouting, they rushed from the hillsode and the cot,
Woodland and prairie sent forth its sturdy foeman,
Waving above them the shining battle-blade.

(CHORUS)

3.
See, from the busy mart, men of ev're labor,
See, from the workshop, the hamlet and the cot,
Marshall a million with twisty heart and saber,
Daring _to die_, but dishonor _daring not!_

(CHORUS)

4.
Seathless the Union bell's alarm of hat shall weather;
Fear not the shock in the van our colors fly!
Hail to the stars and the holy stripes forever!
Uncle Sam's boys, fight to conquer or die.

(CHORUS)
