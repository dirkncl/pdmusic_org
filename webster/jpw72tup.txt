Now I lay me—”
Say it darling,
“Lay me” lisped the tiny lips
Of my daughter, kneeling, bending,
O’er her folded fingertips,
“Down to sleep—” “to sleep,” she murmur’d,
And the curly head drop’d low;
“I pray the Lord—” I gently added,
You can say it all I know.
“Pray the Lord“ the words came faintly
Fainter still “my sould to keep;”
Then the tired head fairly nodded,
And the child was fast asleep.
But the dewy eyes half opened,
When I clasped her to my breast,
And the dear voice softly whispered
“Mama, God knows all the rest,.
Mama, God knows all the rest.”

CHORUS
Oh the trusting,
Sweet confiding,
Of the child heart!
Would that I
Thus might trust my Heavenly Father,
He Who hears my feeblest cry.
Thus might trust my Heavenly Father,
He Who hears my feeblest cry.
