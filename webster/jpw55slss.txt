Quartette
As Sung by the  Blakeley Family
At their Popular Concerts
Music Composed by Jospeph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875.
Poetry by T. M. Newton.

[CHORUS]
Softly, lightly, sweetly sing,
Breathe, oh! breathe that strain again,
Let its rich melodious ring,
Echo back from plain to plain.

1.
Like the golden tints of morning,
Or the silvery ripling wave,
Lite the purple hues adorning,
Flow'rs that deck'd thy mother's grave.

Lo within thine eye is beaming,
Pensive thoughts of dear ones fled,
And tho' round the lights are gleaming,
Thou art musing on the dead. Then

(CHORUS)

2.
Oh the sunny hours of childhood
And bright hopes of youthful glee,
Oh the well remembered wild wood
Where we wandered wild and free;

Youthful hopes have all been broken,
Hushed the friends of early love,
But kind memory bears a token,
That we'll meet them all above. Then

(CHORUS)
