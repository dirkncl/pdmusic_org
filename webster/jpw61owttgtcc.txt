1. Oh! wait till the good time coming comes,
Not like the one in the olded times;
But wait till the good time coming comes,
We will have no trouble any more.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Columbia now and ever more,
Oh! Columbia now and ever more,
All your stars are together,
Be they ever so forever,
Oh! Columbia for ever, ever more.

2. Oh! wait till we learn the law of love,
Brought us by angels from above,
All other laws will useless prove,
Then we値l have no trouble any more. 

3. Oh! wait till we learn the law of right,
The law, now called, the law of might,
Carolina boys will cease to fight;
And we値l have no trouble any more.

4. Oh! wait till falsehood is no more,
Fanaticism痴 reign is oe池,
And Truth prevails from shore to shore,
Then we値l have no trouble any more.

5. Oh! wait till we all shall be free, be free,
And not alas, in chains shall be,
In this famed land of liberty;
Then we値l have no trouble any more.

6. Oh! wait until the might and right
Combined, dispels the gloomy night,
And earth rejoice in their light,
Then we値l have no trouble any more.

6. Now friends together three times three,
For universal liberty,
For union and for freemen free,
God bless Columbia evermore.

7. We will have no trouble any more,
We will have no trouble any more,
We will all love each other
And we値l call each man our brother
We will have no trouble any more,
