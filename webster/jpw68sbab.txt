"The Sweet By-and-By" (1868)
Beautiful Ballad
Words by S. Fillmore Bennett
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar,
For the Father awaits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place here.

CHORUS 2 times
In the sweet (by and by,) by and by, (by and by,)
We shall meet on the beautiful shore, (by and by,)
In the sweet (by and by,) by and by, (by and by,)
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

2.
We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no nore--
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer the tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of his love,
And the blessing that hallow our days!

(CHORUS 2 times)
