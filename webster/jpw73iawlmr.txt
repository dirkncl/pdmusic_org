"I Am Weary Let Me Rest" (1873)
Words by Eben Eugene Rexford, 1848-1916
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
I am weary, let me rest!
Underneath the nodding clover,
With the grass above my breast,
And the daisies bending over.
Oh! the thought is strangely sweet!
Rest and peace secure from sorrow!
And the tramp of busy feet!
Rest that wakes on no to morrow!
I am weary, I am weary,
I am weary let me rest.

2.
I am weary, let me sleep,
With my hands on my bosom
But, I pray you, let me keep
In their clasp some little blossom.
I have loved earth's flowers well
Sweet the friendship they have given;
Are the rose and asphodel
Half as fair, that bloom in Heaven?
I am weary, I am weary,
I am weary let me sleep.


3.
I am weary, and must rest!
As a child with sorrow grieving,
Finds upon its mother's breast
Peace, in her great love believing
So, to the green breast of earth
Turn I, weary, tired and lonely,
For the rest that I shall find
On her gentle bosom only.
I am weary, I am weary,
I am weary let me rest.
