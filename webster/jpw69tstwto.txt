1. The skies are blue, the day is fair,
  And summer crowns the hills,
A breath of balm the berries bear,
  The bird his love song trills;
But though the summer pave my way,
  With level lines of gold,
My heart turns backward from this day,
  The sweet times were the old.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The sweet times were the old,
  The sweet times were the old,
My heart turns backward from this day,
  The sweet times were the old.

2. With sinless heart I walk again,
  The way life’s morning crowned,
Its cup of nameless bliss I drain,
  Its sunshine gleams around;
Its thrill of joy is mine once more,
   Its roses red unfold,
I live its pleasures o’er and o’er,
  The sweet times were the old.

3. However glad a life may be,
  However fortune smile,
However smooth the widening sea,
  Our lifeboat sails the while;
We love the days whose happy span,
  Our early memories hold,
When life was young and love began,
  The sweet times were the old.
