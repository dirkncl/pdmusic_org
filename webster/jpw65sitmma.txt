1. Sweet is thy memory, Mary Alleen.
Pure as the angels, bright, Mary Alleen;
Thou wert the treasure that gladened our sky,
Sadness and sorrow came, when thou didst die,
Gloom and despondency darken’d each scene,
When thou didst leave this world, Mary Alleen,
When thou didst leave this world, Mary Alleen.

2. Flowers in beauty bloom— Mary Alleen.
Gone is their sweet perfume— Mary Alleen.
Gone is the fragrance they yielded to thee,—
Gone is the gladness of earth and of sea;
Linger sweet memories where thou hast been,
Footsteps that tell of thee, Mary Alleen,—
Footsteps that tell of thee, Mary Alleen.

3. Oh! may we meet again— Mary Alleen,
Past death’s deep, rolling mai— Mary Alleen,
Meet where the streets by the angels are trod—
Meet where the children are gathered to God,—
Meet their long years with their days intervene—
Yet may we meet thee, sweet Mary Alleen,—
Yet may we meet thee, sweet Mary Alleen.
