"Kitty McCree O'Tossell" (12 Nov. 1870)
Song & Chorus
Words by Edward Capern
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

CHORUS
Merrily, merrily pipes the merle,
Merrily lilts the throstle,
Merrily sings the milking girl,
Kitty M'Cree O'Tossell.

1.
Singing down by the meadow gate,
Gay as as golden gladdie,
Little song birds will call for their mate;
Kitty is calling her laddie.

(CHORUS)

2.
Over the lea as blith as a bee,
Tramping new blown daisies;
Over the stile, with love in his smile,
See, he comes singing her praises.

(CHORUS)

3.
Singing still by the meadow gate,
Why doth the maiden tarry?
Little song birds will wait for their mates;
Littly is waiting for Larry.

(CHORUS)

4.
"Kitty M'Cree" "Larry Magee,
Who would have thought of this meeting?"
"Kiss, and I'll carry your pail," said he;
And the lark sang aloud at the greeting.

CHORUS
Merrily, merrily pipes the merle,
Merrily, merrily lilts the throstle,
And merrily sings the milking girl
Kitty M'Cree O'Tossell.
Kitty M'Cree Larry Magee,
Kitty M'Cree O'Tossell,
But merrily sings the milking girl
Kitty M'Cree O'Tossell.
