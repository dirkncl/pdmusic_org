1. O, Johnny is a farmer boy, so merry, blithe, and free;
He milks the cow, and drives the plow, and not a care has he;
At blush of dawn, he greets the morn, with all its early throng,
And echo sweetly doth repeat his wondrous rush of song.

CHORUS [sung twice [A/B] after each VERSE]
[with overlapping voices]
[S]
He asked me, would I with him wed,
O dear! must I confess?
Of course I meant not what I said,
I should have answered, [A] "yes." [[B]"yes."]
[ATB]
He asked you, would you with him wed,
Of course, confess,
Of course, confess,
Of course, you know not what you said,
you should have answered, [A]"yes," of course. [[B]“yes.]


2. O, Johnny is a farmer boy, so frolicsome and gay;
He mows the grass and then alas! alone he stirs the hay,
While ’round him sit, or o’er him flit, the voiceful birds anear,
Which all day long with happy song the meadow land doth cheer.

3. O, Johnny is a farmer boy, so tall and straight and fair;
His eyes are blue, his heart is true, and brown his flowing hair;
He reaps the grain with horses twaing and one “Cayuga Chief,”
And with his hands he makes the bands and caps the golden sheaf.

4. O, Johnny is a farmer boy, and “might have been” mine own;
But “saddest word that e’er was heard” I’m Johnnyless and lone!
I little thought with what was fraught that momemt so supreme,
When he proposed and I disposed of young love’s happy dream.
