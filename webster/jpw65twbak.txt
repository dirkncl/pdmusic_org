1. 
The quiet moon was shining
On wood and waters clear,
When on his elbow resting,
A wounded volunteer.
Bethought him of his mother
In her far distant home.
And uttered with a plaintive voice,
Oh, Mother! quickly come.
  And uttered with a plaintive voice
  Oh Mother! quickly come.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Quiickly come.
(Quickly come, quickly come.)
And uttured with a plaintive voice
Oh Mother quckly come.
(Oh Mother quickly come.)

2. 
My comrades lie around me,
Some groaning— some are dead.
The damp earth is beneath them.
The stars are overhead.
The wounded cry for water,
But none to give are near.
Oh Mother! I could part with life
If thou wert only here.
  Oh Mother! I could part with life
  If thou wert only here.

3. 
My thoughts run back, my mother,
To that bright morn in May,
When last I looked upon thee,
And thou didst only say—
“Farewell, my boy, forever,
I fear thou will not come,
To bless my aged eyes again,
In this thy happy home.
  To bless my aged eyes again,
  In this thy happy home.”

4. 
Still resting on his elbow,
The wounded volunteer,
Gazed wildly round, and whispered,
“Here mother, I am here;
I’m growing cold, I’m dying,
And far from thee and home.
Come ease my heart, if not my wounds,
Come Mother, quickly come.
  Come ease my heart, if not my wounds,
  Come Mother, quickly come.”
