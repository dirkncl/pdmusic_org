[1st Voice [Daughter]]
Mama I'm so glad I have found you alone,--
I'm all in a flutter just now,--
I've got such a secret to tell you, Mama,
That but you in this wide world must know;
Young Alfred Adolphis, the question has pop'd,
And he asked me his darling to be;
Now don't frown, dear Mother, he love me I'm sure,
For he wept when he asked it of me.

[2nd Voice [Mother]]
Only hear! I shall faint! I am horribly shocked!
To think that you should thus e'er descend.
Oh, the thought of your wedding a boy in his bib,
Too nameless to claim as a friend.

[1st Voice]
As a scholar, but few are his equals, Mama.
And Europe, you know, he has done.

[2nd Voice]
No wide traveled bookworm shall you ever wed,
Or I be the mother of one.

[1st Voice]
Mama, he's a singer.

[2nd Voice]
Oh fiddlededee!
He never shall sing you away.
You had better take up with a baker of dough,
Than a poor scaly singer of A;
I trust there's a destiny higher than this,
For each branch of our family tree;
'Twas n't thus when your Father and I were made one,
He shared a position with me.

[1st Voice]
Well, Mother, poor Alfred is lonely and sad,
His burden is all he can bear,
For his aunt, Mrs. Croesus, but lately has died,
And made him by will her sole heir.

[2nd Voice]
Good woman! I knew her, my sympathy's roused,
We can not his good heart refuse.
Accept your dear Alfred, unfortunate youth!
And marry as soon as you choose.

[DUET]
Weii, then let us bind us his sorrowing heart,
Affection pour into the wound.
We'll take the poor orphan and give him a home,
Right glad such a chance to have found.
We will share in his sorrows, his music and
[1st Voice]
love.

[2nd Voice]
A mother,
[1st Voice]
a wife.

[DUET]
I will be.
For the poor and unfortunate cast at our door
There is
[1st Voice] love
[2nd Voice] gold
[DUET]
enough surely for three.
