1. 
They call my Slave, and bid me toil,
Among the cotton rows:
While soft free winds blow on my cheek,
Down where the orange grows.
Today I pick the whitened blooms,
And shake the orange trees;
Tonight I leave the cotton looms—
Tonight I shall be free.
The Sea Gull seeks the bounding wave,
The Tiger roams the plain—
The Indian wears his coral beads,
The Black Man wears his chains.
I watch the white sails ride the wave;
They bear my child away;
But I alas! the white man’s slave,
I must not stop to pray.

2. 
Toil on! Toil on! they bid me still;
But hark! the cannos boom—
What means it? Yonder from the North
Those treading millions come:
I see their campfires gleaming bright,
They beckon now to me;
I leave Old Master’s chains tonight;
Tonight I shall be free.
They call me Slave, and bid me toil,
Among the conton rows;
While soft, free winds blow on my cheek,
Down where the orange grows.
Today I pick the whitened blooms,
And shake the orange tree;
Tonight I leave the cotton looms.
Tonight I shall be free.
Tonight I shall be free.
