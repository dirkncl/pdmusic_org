* The following "Quintett" may be sung at the end of each verse;
or after the last verse only; or it may be omitted, when there are not
a sufficient number of voices present to fill all the parts, as the Song
is complete without it.

1. On a quiet sunny hillside,
  Where violets sip the dew,
And daiseys and forgetmenots
  Are dotted in richest hue;
Stands a shady vinewreathed cottage,
  With brown eaves hanging low,
That fills my soul with happiness,
  I love, I love it so.

QUINTETT [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! the dear and happy moments,
  That will never more return,
Tho’ they’re gone alas! forever,
  We will not forever mourn.
There’s a better world beyond us
  There’s a better life to come;
Let’s be happy while we linger,
  For this world is still our own.

2. Beneath the rustic portico
  I’ve sat in other hours,
And reared my  airy castles
  Doomed to vanish with the flowers;
They’re bound by holy ties of love,
  In twilight soft and gray,
A merryhearted, happy band,
  We whiled the hours away.

3. But now, alas! how changed are those
  Who loved in life’s young tide;
No more they cluster round the hearth,
  They’re scattered far and wide;
Some to the spiritland are gone,
  Some o’er the ocean roam,
And few are left of those who once
  Made beautiful our home.
