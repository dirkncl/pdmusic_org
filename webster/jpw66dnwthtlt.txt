1. 
Do not wound the heart that loves thee, 
Do not cause it needless pain, 
For the heart that once is blighted, 
Like the rose, ne’er blooms again; 
It may seem a goodly flower 
And a while delight the eye, 
But there is a secret anguish 
That will cause it soon to die. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Do not wound the heart that loves thee, 
Do not cause it needless pain, 
For the heart that once is blighted, 
Like the rose ne’er blooms again.

2. 
Do not wound the heart that loves thee, 
Bid it  live beneath thy smile, 
Ever cause it to be happy, 
And the darkest hours beguile; 
If thy blessing will give pleasure 
To the heart that loves but thee, 
It will prove a priceless treasure 
When thy summer friends shall flee.

3. 
Do not  wound the heart that loves thee, 
For the time perhaps may come 
When, all fickle hearts departed 
Thou can’st find one heart’s true home; 
If thou can’st not bid  it hope yet 
For the smile possession wears, 
Do not wound the heart that loves thee 
Lift the burdens that it bears.
