1. The golden summer decked the hills
  When we were girls together, May,
Love’s golden summer warmed our hearts,
  Love’s roses blossomed on our way;
Fell on my cheek thy gentle kiss,
  Soft as the summer roseleaf falls,
And mem’ry, to my list’ning ear,
  The music of thy voice recalls.

CHORUS 1-3
Dear May!
  Dearest sister May!
Love's summer warmed our trusted hearts,
  And scattered roses on our way.

2. Adown life’s stream we floated pn
  But not together sister May,
My bark was lost to sight of thee,
  Borne by the currents far away;
But all these years our hearts were one,
  Nor time, nor change, nor sorrow’s blast,
Had power to wither love’s sweet vine,
  One clinging tendril to unclasp.

3. Today again, thy hand to mine,
  We live the days of old, dear May,
And fancy we are girls again,
  Beneath the old home roof at play.
The years, the fleeting years have changed,
  But as of old our hearts are one,
And on us as of old there falls
  Love’s tender, gentle, benison.

4. O years, whose cold relentless days
  Again must sever me from May!
Bring not to her one chilling blast,
  Bring not to her one gloomy day,
But let the sweetness of thy blooms
  For her a grateful perfume shed;
Thy softest sunshine evermore
  Fall, full of blessing on her head!

CHORUS 4
Dear May!
  Dearest May!
My love shall ever follow thee,
  And breathe its fragrance on thy way.
