1.
Call Jenny from her spinning,
  Call Jenny from the mill;
I am going on a journey,
  That is very dark and still.
I am going on a journey,
  To be long and long away,
And I want to see and charge them
  To be good to little May.

[REFRAIN]
For I’m going on a journey
  To be long and long away
And I want to see and charge them
  To be kind to little May.

2.
I’m not afraid to leave them,
  For they both have strength and will;
And will work away their grieving,
  At the wheel, and on the mill.
My Jenny’s heart is tender,
  But in all the long hot hours
She never leaves her spinning,
  To bear water to the flowers.

[REFRAIN]
I am going on a journey
  To be long and long away
And I want to see and charge them
  To be kind to little May.

3.
And I want to see and charge her,
  Though I know she will do right;
To mind she keeps the cradle
  Where the fire is burning bright.
And Jossy seeming proud and cold,
  Is only firm and brave;
His hands will be the first to plant
  The daisies on my grave.

[REFRAIN]
For I’m going on a journey
  To be long and long away
And I want to see and charge them
  To be kind to little May.

4.
But to his heart a baby’s wants
  Might fail to find their way;
And I want to see and charge him,
  To be kind to little May.
So go and call them, quickly,
  From the wheel and from the mill;
For I’m going on a journey
  That is very dark and still.

[REFRAIN]
I am going on a journey
  To be long and long away
And I want to see and charge them
  To be kind to little May.
