1. The roses  are blooming where sweet Nellie sleeps
  The sleep that no waking shall know,
And nightly the dew of the blue heaven weeps
  O’er her who is resting below;
To marble has frozen her beautiful smile,
  The song on her sweet lip has died,
And she who had blest us with loving ere while,
  With Death crossed the sivery tide.

2. No more will her footfall make music below,
  We wait for her coming in vain,
And long for the loving that she could bestow,
  As violets long for the rain;
But up on the shore of the Beautiful Land
  Our darling will meet us we know,
And clasp us again as of old by the hand,
  Where Heaven’s own sweet lilies blow.
