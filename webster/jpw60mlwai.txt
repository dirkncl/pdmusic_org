1. We’re toiling on together,
  My little wife and I,
Thro’ bright and sunny weather,
  And ’neath a clouldless sky;
Our hearts have ne’er been parted,
  And ne’er have known a woe,
Since first our truth we plighted
  Some twenty years ago.
    Since first our truth we plighted
      Some twenty years ago.

2. We cheer each other often
  With songs we used to sing,
It makes our old hearts soften,
  Their old familiar ring.
Round closely to each other—
  By ties none can untie,
We’re all to one another—
  My little wife and I.
    We’re all to one another—
      My little wife and I.

3. Though death these ties may sever,
  Of this our earthly love,
We’ll live and love forever,
  In our long home above.
In bright or cloudy weather,
  ’Neath dark or sunny sky,
We’ll wander on together—
  My little wife and I.
    We’ll wander on together—
      My little wife and I.
