"The Star of Love" (1873)
Words by Luke Collin
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
At eve we launch'd our fairy boat,
With hearts and hands aquiver,
And glided from the darksome shore
Adown the lightsome river;
The west wind chanted low and sweet
Thro' branches intertwining,
And far aloft where angels meet,
The friendly stars were shining.

CHORUS [with overlapped voices]
[SOPRANO]
The kindly stars,
The faithful stars,
The friendly stars were shining,
The kindly stars,
The faithful stars,
The tender stars were shining.
[ALTO and TENOR]
The kindly stars,
The friendly stars,
The faithful stars,
The friendly stars,
The friendly stars were shining,
The tender stars,
The tender stars,
The faithful stars,
The faithful tender friendly stars
were shining, shining, shining,
stars were shining, shining.
[BASS]
The kindly stars,
The friendly stars,
The faithful stars,
Ever faithful stars,
The friendly stars,
The friendly stars,
The friendly stars were shining,
The kindly stars,
The faithful stars,
The dainty, kind and tender,
Friendly, faithful stars,
The kind and faithful friendly,
The dainty, fond and tender
stars were shining, shining.

2.
The listless oars hung at the locks,
Nor time nor course was noted,
But still the hours were flying fast
As on and on we floated;
And if a cloud rose on our dream
It had a silver lining,
For in the air and in the stream
The tender stars were shining.

(CHORUS)

3.
As down that gently flowing stream
The rippling, laughing river
We floated then, in love's young dream,
May we float on forever;
And down life's winding current move,
With thoughts and hops entwining,
While in our hearts the star of love
Still brightly shall be shining.

(CHORUS)
