1. Far away! Far away! 
  Beyond those hills of blue,
A cottage brightly smiles ’mid wreathes
  Of roses blushing through,
My gentle Emma once again
  We there in joy may roam
And ’neath the hawthorne’s waving shade
  Talk of our future home.

CHORUS 1-3
Far away! Far away!
  Still my heart is true,
For oh! this rose doth speak my love,
  This violet tells I’m true.

2. Once again! once again!
  Cedar copsewood green,
Where length’ning shades in mystic love
  Twine fondly round the scene.
Again I hope while wandering there,
  To press thee to my heart,
And tell me, O! my Emma, love,
  How very dear thou art.

3. Annie love, Annie love,
  Flowers will spring anew,
And ah! when all is bright and green,
  I’ll come, I’ll come to you.
When May birds sing in every tree,
  When Nature laughs so gay,
Then, Emma, will I come to thee—
  No longer I may stay.
