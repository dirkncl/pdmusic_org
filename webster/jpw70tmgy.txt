Quartette & Chorus.
Words by L. J. Bates.
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 11819-1875.

1.
Some thousands of aeons ago, _you know_,
When Time was a jaunty young beau, _you know_,
By command of the crown,
He was told to write down
In an almanac, needed to show, _you know_,
A record complete,
Unspotted and neat,
Of the years yet to be in our new world below.

CHORUS
Good bye, sorrow;
We'll happy be to morrow;
For the good time coming must be near:
The morning is breaking,
And the whole world is waking,
To be ready for the Master's Gold Year.

2.
But the careless young rascal would stray, _they say_,
For a sweet little angel in gray, _they say_,
With her witching bright face,
And her innocent grace
Lured Time from his work to her play, _they say_.
And when he came back,
Too often, a-lack,
He blotted the years in a very sad way.

(CHORUS)

3.
Once, when he had grown over-bold, _I'm told_,
His almanac lying unrolled, _I'm told_,
The Master came in,
And O, shame! and O, sin!
He discovered at once he'd been sold, _I'm told_;
By way of rebuke,
He wrote in the book
The name of one year in bright letters of gold.

(CHORUS)

4.
Since then, as we see very clear, _O, dear!_
Time's blots were both frequent and queer, _O, dear!_
A blot on the page
Of most years of our age
In the record of life must appear, _O, dear!_
But rapture most high!
In the bright by an by
The world shall rejoice in the Master's Gold Year.

(CHORUS)
