1. Six lonely years have come and gone,
  Six years this very night,
Since angels took dear Eddie home
  Beyond the stars so bright.
But what are years, tho’ measured out,
  To love which lives forever;—
A love that links itself to those
  Who are gone beyond the river.

2. The summer wears away as then,
  The wind comes sighing too,
A sighing as among the elms
  That night six years ago.
But mem’ries closer round that hour
  When we our watch were keeping,
We closed his little eyes, for aye,
  And left him to his sleeping.

3. The grass is dying on the turf,
  No flowers perfume the sod;
No whispered prayer beside that grove,
  Gone trembling up to God;
For stranger feet now press the path
  We trod with bitter weeping,
They do not know they’re passing by
  The spot where Eddie’s sleeping.

4. But what tho’ weary miles between,
  Divide us from the dust,
Of one we loved and cherished well;
  “Tho’ gone he is not lost.”
The creeping years— they cannot stretch
  Between the loved forever;
E’en now glad spirits reaching out,
  Touch palms across the river.
