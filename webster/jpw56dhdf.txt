1. Oh the happy, happy hours of childhood,
Oh the moments gone—
Laughing rivulets and smiling wildwood
Down by my dear old home;
There a happy little boy I wandered,
Joyous, light and gay,
Where the golden winged hours I squandered,
Happy as the birds in May.

2. Still how fondly mem’ry loves to linger
By the threshold door,
There she’s training with her busy fingers
Flow’rs that will bloom no more,
Deep within the grave of things departed,
Springtime of life’s year,
Garlands braided for the brolkenhearted
Wither on the mould’ring bier.

[Refrain]
Never more those hours of gladness
Can this bosom swell,
Oh my ever bleeding heart ’tis madness,
Dear happy days farewell.
