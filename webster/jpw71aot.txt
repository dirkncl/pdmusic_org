"Always of Thee" (2 Apr. 1871)
Ballad
Words by Luke Collin
Music by Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-1875

1.
O Lizzie, darling Lizzie,
When the purple hues of morn,
Faintly flush the far horizon,
Where the infant day is born;
When I woke from sleep and dreaming,
And the world comes back to me,
Then I muse on what is dearest
And my thought's are most of thee.


2.
O Lizzie, darling Lizzie,
When the autumn sun so bright,
In its royal midday splendor,
Floods the earth with golden light;
In the busy hours of labor,
When sweet fancy roams at will,
Then, like gems beneath the ocean,
Thou art in my mem'ry still.

3.
O Lizzie, darling Lizzie,
When the sun has gone to rest,
And the mellow ev'ning twilight,
Lingers softly in the west;
When the timid stars are peeping,
From the dim expanse of blue,
Then my heart is fondly beating
And my thought's are still of you.

4.
O Lizzie, darling Lizzie,
Pure and beautiful and bright,
Thro' the weary, wakeful hours
Or the lone silent night;
Or whatever scenes around me.
Heavy heart or light and free,
Still my dearest thoughts are given,
Ever always love, to thee.
