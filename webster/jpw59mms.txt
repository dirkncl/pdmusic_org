1. I love to hear my mother’s song,
  For welcome is the strain
That breaks upon my throbbing heart,
  And chains my aching brain,
And visions bright of childhood’s hours,
  A wild tumultuous throng,
Return, as though on angel’s wings,
  With that remember’d song.

2. The tide of years upon whose flood
  My soul has held her track,
Obeys the magic of that song,
  And rolls its waters back;
While manhood’s strife, and bitter cares,
  And pain and anguish flee;
And once again I am a child
  Upon my mother’s knee.

3. As a stong diver bringeth up
  From ocean’s deepest caves
The gems that deck the mermaid’s brow,
  Beneathe the surging waves,
So pierce my soul those well known tones,
  And all my thoughts condense,
And bring from out the shadowy past
  My childhood’s innocence.

4. Oft in the halls of mirth and song
  I’ve felt my bosom swell,
And the blood leap within my veins,
  Beneath the potent spell;
And thought, with fairy fingers soft,
  Would play on memory’s string,
As on the ear fell sweet the son
  My mother used to sing.
