1. 
I stand on mem’ry’s golden shore, 
And muse and dream, this autumn night, 
Recalling forms that never more 
Shall bless on earth my weary sight 
I reach in vain to grasp the hands 
That beckon from the further side, 
Where gleams the shining silver sands— 
Where murmurs soft the silver tide 
  Where gleam the shining silver sands— 
  Where mummurs soft the silver tide. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I stand on mem’ry’s golden shore. 
I tread life’s weary rounds alone (alone).
The dear departed comes no more (never more).
The all of life I love is gone (is gone.).

2. 
O thou unloving, dreamy past, 
Give back what I have giv’n to thee— 
Flow‘rs that love’s tree abortive cast— 
Fair hopes that mid thy treasures be; 
Life’s tender buds that I have kiss’d, 
And water’d with my anxious tears, 
I see not through the gath’ring mists 
Of doubt, and vain distrust and fears 
  I see not through the gath’ring mists 
  Of doubt, and vain distrust and fears. 

3. Yet sometimes visions come to bless— 
Again with her I seem to stand, 
And full of newborn longings, press 
With trembling clasp her gentle hand 
Dear loving spirit leave me not 
To wend these weary shores alone 
Hath not thy heaven for me a spot 
Full of sweet love, and near thine own 
  Hath not thy heaven for me a spot, 
  Full of sweet love, and near thine own. 

4. 
I dream, but dreaming is in vain 
To resurrect the buried dead, 
And waking but renews my pain, 
With mem’ry of the vision fled 
In vain I tread on mem’ry’s shore, 
And plead with tears for what is gone— 
The holy past returns no more; 
I walk the shores of life alone 
  The holy past returns no more: 
  I walk the shores of life alone.
