1.
Oh, Father take my hand,
And o'er the waters dark,
When tempests rage, and billows roar,
Oh, guide my feeble bark.
Oh, teach my weary heart,
Obediant still to be;
And aye direct my feeble feet,
Dear Saviour up to thee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Father, take my hand,
And through the night,
Lead to the light, Thy child!
Lead to the light, Thy child!
Lead to the light, Thy child!

2.
Oh, Father take my hand,
Lest I should go astray,
For clouds so angry, dark and cold,
Do sorely blind my way.
Oh, let my aching head
Upon thy bosom rest;
Like smiling babe that pillow'd lies,
Upon its mother's breast.

3.
Oh, thou whose weary feet,
All bleeding marked the way,
Oh, Light of an immortal light!
Grant me one single ray.
Oh, thou who bore the cross
So patiently 'mid scorn;
And wore upon thy shining brow,
The piercing crown of thorn.
