1. 
Why down in ole Virginny 
Dar I hear de fiddle ring 
All de time dis nigger Jo 
Play upon de Banjo String, 
I got up in de morning 
I go to de kitchen 
To get a chunck ob fire 
For to go a fishing.

2. 
My mamma was a wolf 
My daddy was a tiger 
I am what you call 
De Ole Virginny Nigger 
Half  fire half smoke     
A little touch of thunder 
I am what you call 
De eighth wonder.

3. 
I got up in de morning
Bout broke ob day
I went to de riber
My canoe gone away
When I got to de riber
De riber rader wide
I look ober yonder
My canoe on toder side.

4. 
Last saturday night
De nigger went a hunting
De dog run de wooler
And de wooler run de tiger
De tiger run de stiff neck
Stiff nect run de debil
And dey all run together
[Spoken](And de nigger run rite arter em)

5. 
I went to de mill
For to see de miller
Says I Ole Mr Miller
Aint you got a chor tobacco
De miller had three dogs
One de name was Jowler
De oder ole Ranger
And de oder ole (Hard Times.)
