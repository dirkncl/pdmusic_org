1. O, white folks listen to dis song, dat I am gwine to sing, 
Of a pretty little yaller gal, who danc’d de wiginping! 
Her eyes were bright as de stars at night, her teeth were like de snow; 
One pleasant night, wid heart so light, to see her I did go.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For she was de prettiest yaller gal 
dat ever I did see, 
She was de princess of my heart, 
And she was de gal for me.

2. I went to see dis colored gal one pleasant night in May;
When in de field my work was done, I had a holy day,
I took her out a walking and to her I did say—
“My dearest gal, I lub you so, oh! hab me now I pray!”

3. She gib consent to hab me if I would only say
I’d lub her now and ebermore and nebber run away;—
To gib her proof I lubed her, I for de parson went,
Since den I’ve lib’d in harmony and happy days I spent.
