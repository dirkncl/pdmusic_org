1.
I left the husking party late,
  I began to feel quite tired,
When just as I reach'd ole massa's gate
  I heard the cry of Fire, (Fire,) (Fire,)

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Fire Dere's fire down below,
dere's fire down below,
Den toat dat bucket of water boys,
Dere's fire down below,
Den toat dat bucket of water boys,
Dere's fire down below.

2.
Den I went running down de street,
  Oh how I did suspire,
When dar I see ole massa's house,
  And dat was all on fire, (Fire,) (fire,)

3.
As I went running round de house,
  All in de mud and mire,
And den I saved ole massa's pig,
  From burning in de fire, (fire,) (fire,)

4.
I lub to hear de bells all ring,
  O how I do admire;
I lub to see de gingines all
  A running to de fire, (fire,) (fire,)
