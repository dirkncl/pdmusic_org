1. Some spirit wafts our mountains lay!
  Hilliho! boys, Hililo!
To distant groves and glens away!
  Hilliho! boys, Hililo!
E’en so the tide of empire flows!
  Ho! boys, Hilliho!
Rejoining as it westward flows
  Ho! boys, Hilliho!
To refresh our weary way,
Gush the crystal fountains
As a pilgrim band we stray,
Cheerly o’er the mountains
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Ho! boys, Hilliho!

2. The woodland rings with song and shout!
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
As though a fairy hunt were out
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
E’en so the voice of woman cheers
  Ho! boys, Hilliho!
The hearts of hardy mountaineers
  Ho! boys, Hiliho!
Like the glow of northern skies
Mirror’d in the fountains,
Beams the lovelight of fond eyes
As we cross the mountains
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Hilliho! boys, Hilliho!
  Ho! boys, Hilliho!
