1. Last new year’s day as I’ve heard say, 
Dick mounted on his dappled grey; 
And he put on his sunday cloaths, 
His scarlet waistcoat shoes, and hose. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Tee dee dee diddle dee.

2. The hat he wore upon his head,
It was adorn’d with ribbons red,
And thus rode Dick of Tauntendeen
To court the farmer’s daughter Jane.

3. Oh I can plow, and I can sew,
And sometimes to the market go,
With Goodman Dobson’s corn and hay
I’ll earn you six pence ev’ry day.

4. This gave the farmer great delight,
But little Jane, she laugh’d outright,
At which poor Dick no more would say,
So mounting Debbin rode away.
