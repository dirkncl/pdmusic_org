As late by love and folly tost, 
my reason fled, my peace was lost; 
the starting tear, the heaving sigh, 
proclaim’s my bosom’s anarchy. 
Impatience, weary of my chain 
I now my liberty regain; 
Behold the feeble Tyrants fly, 
if we resist their Tyranny. 
Behold the feeble Tyrants fly, 
if we resist their Tyranny. 
Thy reign too cruel Maid is past, is past, 
that o'er my soul distraction cast, my soul distraction cast; 
The false delusion is no more, 
And all the dream of love is o’er 
Thy reign too cruel Maid is past, is past, 
And all the dream of love is o’er, the dream of love is o’er.
[REPEAT ALL (except prelude)]
