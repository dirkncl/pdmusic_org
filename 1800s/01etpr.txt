Written and Composed by John J. Hawkins

1. While some on rights and some on wrongs
  Prefer their own reflections,
The People's right demand our songs
  The Right of free Elections.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The People's right demand our songs
The Right of free Elections.

2. For Government and order's sake,
  And Laws important sections,
We should support and pleasure take
  In frequent Free Elections.

3. Our Agricult'ral int'rest, Marrs,
  And Mercantile connections,
With Manufactures, Science, Arts,
  Must thrive by free Elections.

4. To thwart the schemes of Factiduy bands,
  Who for us plan subjections,
The cause of Liberty demands,
  Our Votes in all Elections.

5. Should Enemies before us round,
  Of foreign fiece complexions,
Undaunted we will stand our ground,
  Upheld by free Elections.

6. We'll never from our duty swerve,
  Let who will make objections,
But while we live, unchanged preserve,
  The Freedom of Elections.
