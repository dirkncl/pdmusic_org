1. Oh bear me to my Cottage Home!
In my lovely native Land
And let my dying eyes be closed
By my Mother’s kindly hand,
Oh let me look upon her face
Once more that sweet voice hear,
That even death’s strong Agony
With holy love can cheer;
Alas! Alas! my prayer is vain,
Oh! I ne’er shall see my home again.

2. Oh how I long for each dear scene
From which my manhood roved,
The mossy bank, the glittering stream,
The valley childhood loved,
My gentle sister where art thou?
My brother where, Oh where?
A stranger bathes my fevered brow
And hears my dying prayer;
Alas Alas! that prayer is vain
Oh! I ne’er shall see my home again.

3. Some spell is on me some sweet spell!
I see the hallowed spot,
I know each leaf of that brave tree
That shades my Father’s Cot!
It is my Mother’s face I see,
My Sister, thou art pressing
My dying hand! and even now
I hear my Father’s blessing,
Farewell! my prayer was not in vain,
My Spirit sees! my home again.
