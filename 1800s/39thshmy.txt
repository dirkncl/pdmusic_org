1. Tell her she haunts me yet 
As in those vanished years; 
Tell her since last we met, 
These eyes have known no tears; 

Tell her my very smile 
Hath caught the chill of care; 
My heart is dark with guile, 
What doth her mem’ry there? 

Wherefore doth she return 
Where all is dim and lone, 
As a lamp whose bright rays burn 
Beneath a funeral stone 

Better the dead should sleep 
Unmock’d by that red glare, 
Better she ne’er should sweep 
Across my soul’s despair, 
  Across my soul’s despair.

2. Tell her with yearnings vain 
I’ve stretch’d mine arms on high, 
Praying to meet again 
Her smile if but to die. 

But tell her now I pray 
With clos’d and shadow’d eyes, 
All dreams may melt away 
That leave such memories. 

Tell her my soul hath lost 
Its parity and truth, 
Tell her my visions cross’d 
Have worn away my youth; 

Tell her my heart is dearth, 
My brow like age is wan, 
And, that I stand on earth 
A lone forsaken man, 
  A lone forsaken man.
