1. Down in the valley my father dwells,
See! yonder my brother is leaning;
All that our garden produces, he sells,
And I help him a little by gleaning.
I haste away, at break of day,
My basket to fill by the water;
And I earn what I can, for my father poor man,
For I am his only daughter,
For I am his only daughter.

2. Ladies have offer’d me places, three,
And bid me to choose which I’d rather;
But this Brief answer they get from me
“Dear ma’am, only think of my father!”
What would he do, were Jane with you,
Forgetting the duty he taught her,
O how would he grieve, the Cot should I leave!
For I am his only daughter,
For I am his only daughter.

3. William, who bought with the fields below
The three pretty cows of old Mary
Shortly will want, (for he told me so,)
A wife to take care of his dairy;
He lives so near, my father dear
(’Tis only just over the water)
Should he bid me go, sure, I could not say No
Though I am an only daughter,
Though I am an only daughter.
