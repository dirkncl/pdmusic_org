"She Sleeps in the Valley" (1846)
as sung by the
Harmoneons
Words by J. Simmonds Davis
Music by L. V. H. Crosby

    This song was suggested by the mysterious disappearance of
a young female, known as he beautiful cigar girl of the City
of New York, who is supposed to have been enticed from her
home and overcome with the most cruel and attrocious violence;
all the circumstances being such as to warrant the belief that
the story is literally true with the exception of names.

1. I’ll tell thee a tale of a maiden’s veil,
  It was worn by Jane O’Malley;
On the highland green her form was seen,
  But she now sleeps in the valley.

[sung after each VERSE]
she now sleeps, (she now sleeps)
she now sleeps in the valley.

2. One year ago when the sun was low,
  Along with Elwyn Ally;
To chat and talk she took a walk,
  But she now sleeps in the valley.

3. Her heart was warm, she though no harm,
  She was restrained by Ally;
Her friends did mourn, she did not return,
  And she now sleeps in the valley.

4. They search around, till the spot was found,
  Where struggled Jane O’Malley;
Where the rock was cleft, her veil was left,
  And she now sleeps in the valley.
