1. William in accents of love would complain, 
Mary still turn’d a deaf ear to his pain; 
Oh! if you love me, sweet Molly, sweet Molly, 
Oh! if you love me, you dear woman.

2. I’ll give sweet Molly a fine satin gown,
And a smart poney to take her to town;
Oh! if you love me, sweet Molly, sweet Molly, 
Oh! if you love me, you dear woman.

3. I’ll to your window as soon as ’tis light,
All day I’ll serve you, and guard you all night;
Get away from me, young Willie, young Willie,
Get away from me, you false young man.

4. Since cruel Molly your hate you declare,
Treat me so ill as no mortal can bear;
Farewell sweet Molly forever I leave you,
Farewell sweet Molly forever I’m gone.

5. I wish that I had a fine satin gown,
And a smart poney to take to my tomb;
Oh! if you love me, dear Willie, dear Willie,
Oh! if you love me, you dear young man.

6. Come to my window as soon as ’tis light,
Serve me all day, and oh guard me all night;
Thank you kind Molly, when I would, you would not.
No fickle Molly, Oh! now ’tis too late.
