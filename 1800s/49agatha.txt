1.
When the Swallows homeward fly,
When the roses center'd lie,
When from neither hill nor dale,
Chants the silv'ry nightingale;
In these words my bleeding heart
Would to thee its grief impart,
When I thus thy image lose,
Can I ah, can I, e'er know repose?
  Can I ah, can I, e'er know repose?

2.
When the white swan southward roves,
To seek at noon the orange groves;
When the red tints of the west,
Prove the sun has gone to rest,
In these simple words my bleeding heart,
Would to thee its grief impart--
When I thus thy image lose,
Can I, ah, can I e'er know repose?
  Can I, ah, can I e'er know repose?

3.
Hush my heart, why thus complain,
Thou must too thy woes contain;
Tho' on earth no more we rove
Loudly breathing vows of love!
Then, my heart, must find relief,
Yielding to the words belief;
I shall see thy form again,
Tho' today we part in pain!
