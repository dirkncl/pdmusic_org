1. Alone I sit by thy bright waters, 
Sweet Kennebec, 
The last one of my nation’s daughters, 
leaving the wreck.
Where all the pride of Indian treasure, 
Strewn o’er thy tide, 
Shall never bloom again with pleasure, 
Where Wagum died!

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Great Spirit, far beyond the waters, 
On Leasum smile. 
Receive the last of Wagum’s daughters, 
To thy green isle.

2. On  these high rocks above thy sparkles, 
My father stood, 
But white brow now with murder darkles 
O’er thy bright flood.
’Neath these tall trees where wild winds rattle, 
Over the dead, 
Warriors that fought the last storm battle, 
Have made their bed.

3. And here alone I  sit in sadness, 
Amid their graves, 
My heart, my heart, ah why in madness, 
Weep o’er the brave.
But white man, ah! forbear thy feeling, 
The Red girl scorns, 
Nor weep while I am fondly kneeling, 
O’er their loved forms.
