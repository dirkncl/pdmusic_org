1. Farewell, farewell is a lonely sound
And always brings a sigh,
But give to me when lov’d ones part,
That sweet old word “goodbye”,
That sweet old word “goodbye”,
That sweet old word “goodbye”,
But give to me when love’d ones part,
That sweet old word “goodbye”.

2. Farewell, farewell may do for the gay
When pleasure’s throng is nigh,
But give to me that better word
That comes from the heart “goodbye”,
That comes from the heart “goodbye”,
That comes from the heart “goodbye”,
But give to me that better word
That comes from the heart “goodbye”.

3. Adieu, adieu, we hear it oft
With a tear, perhaps with a sigh,
But the heart feels most when the lips move not,
And the eye speaks the gentle “goodbye”,
And the eye speaks the gentle “goodbye”,
And the eye speaks the gentle “goodbye”,
But the heart feels most when the lips move not,
And the eye speaks the gentle “goodbye”.

4. Farewell, farewell is never heard,
When the tear’s in the Mother’s eye,
Adieu, adieu she speaks it not
But my love “goodbye”, “goodbye”,
But my love “goodbye”, “goodbye”,
But my love “goodbye”, “goodbye”,
Adieu, adieu she speaks it not,
But my love “goodbye”, “goodbye”.
