1.
Our hands have met, but not our hearts;
Our hands will never meet again.
Friends, if we have ever been,
Friends we cannot now remain;
I only know I lov'd you once,
I only know I lov'd in vain.
Our hands have met, but not our hearts;
Our hands will never meet again,
Our hands have met, but not our hearts.
Our hands will never meet again.

2.
Then farewell to heart and hand!
I would our hands had never met;
E'en the outward form of love
Must be resign'd with some regret.
Friends we still might seem to be,
If I my wrong could e'er forget,
Our hands have join'd but not our hearts;
I would our hands hand never met!
Our hands have join'd but not our hearts.
I would our hands had never met!
