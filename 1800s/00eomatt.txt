Emblems of Mem ’ry are these tears
Sad and disstressing to the Mind
Flowing for all succeeding Years
From ev’ry Patriot left behind
Could they alas his life restore
Well might Columbia mourn
Yet let the annual Tribute pour
To wet the Hero’s Urn
Yet let the annual Tribute pour
To wet the Hero’s Urn to wet the Hero’s Urn

Emblems of Mem’ry are these  tears
Sad and distressing to the Mind
Flowing for all succeeding Years
From ev’ry Patriot left behind
Flowing for all succeeding Years
From ev’ry Patriot left behind
From ev’ry Patriot left behind.
