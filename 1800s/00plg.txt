1. A poor little Gypsey I wander forlorn,
My Forturne was told long before I was born,
So Fortunes I tell as forsaken I stray,
And in search of my Love I am lost on my Way:

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Spare a Halfpenny, spare a Halfpenny,
Spare a poor little Gypsey, a Gypsey a Halfpenny,
Spare a poor little Gypsey a Halfpenny.

2. I fear from this Line you have been a sad Man,
And to harm us poor Girls, have form’d many a Plan;
But beware lest Repentance too late cause you Pain,
And attend to the Lesson I give in my Strain.

3. Through Woods and through Wilds oft’ aweary I roam,
Long absent from Parents, from Friends, and from Home;
Though sad is my Heart, and tho’ sore are my Feet,
Yet I sing on my Way thus to all that I meet.
