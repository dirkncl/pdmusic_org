1. Lord, I believe! Oh! strengthen thou my trust  
In that bright hope, a life beyond the grave;
That which this mortal body turns to dust, 
The pure immortal spirit thou wilt save 
Crown of my joy and solace of my grief, 
Lord, I believe! help thou my unbelief.

2. Lord, I believe! and Faith a balm affords, 
Which those who humbly seek shall surely find;
Cheer’d by the promise of these heav’nly words, 
Peace upon Earth and good will towards mankind 
If blighted be my field Or full my sheaf, 
Lord, I believe Help thou my unbelief.
