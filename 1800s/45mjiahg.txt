1.
Miss Julia is a handsome gall, 
  Her heart is young and tender; 
Her eyes are dark and rather small, 
  Her form genteel and slender. 
And den her face so round and fat, 
  De people do admire; 
Her eyes set in dat face at night, 
  Looks  like two towns a fire. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! Julia is a beauty; 
  She blossoms like a Pina; 
O! yah!! she is de prettiest gall, 
  Dat libs in Ole Carlina.

2.
And when Miss Julia takes a walk,
  Tis on some holiday;
A big steam engine goes ahead,
  To clar de track away.
De bells all ring and out she goes,
  Her hair floats on de breezes;
And when de sun shines on her face,
  Makes all de geeses sneezes.

3.
Miss Julia has a little foot,
  And wears a little gaiter;
Which sets as close as e’er you see
  A peeling on a tater.
And when she walks, oh! gracious me!
  O! Moses, what a swell;
De boys and galls dey all cry out,
  Oh! Julia is de belle.
