1. Let Poets rhyme of primrose time,
Of summer with its flowers.
For me I’ll raise no song of praise
For joys no longer ouirs.
My theme shall be that magic tree,
In light and splendour glowing,
Whose branches bear those gifts so rare,
Its fairy-gems bestowing.

[REFRAIN and CHORUS] 1-2.
The Christmas tree, the Christmas tree,
Come circle rount it singing;
Let each advance and take their chance,
And see what fate is bringing. 

2. See here are toys for laughing boys,
And dolls for little misses,
With rings and gloves for constant loves,
For prety maidens kisses;—
Here bracelets fine with gems that shine,
And some worth but a trifle,
You can’t refuse which e’er you choose,
You all the tree may rifle.
