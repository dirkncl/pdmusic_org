1.
Oh a Bachelor's life is merry and gay,
He sips from each flower he meets in his way,
The nectar he quaffs while embracing the thorn,
He leaves the poor Benedick hanging forlorn.

CHORUS 1
Hush brothers! that's the way,
Talking on day by day
We'll thus deceive them
Then by our ready arts
Of their fond honest hearts
We can relieve them.

2.
As pleasantly o'er the bright world he goes,
  Belowved by his friends, caring not for his foes
Through each passing moment some happiness gleams,
  Which night but recalleth in pleasanter dreams.

CHORUS 2
Hush brothers! they're asleep,
While we our vigils keep
Into the morning
Patching our ancient clothes,
Darning our tatter'd hose
For our adorning!

3.
Then reckon the joys of a Bachelor's life,
  Ye recreant sons who are "seeking a wife"
And ask yourselves then if there's aught can repay,
  The wild joyous freedom ye thus throw away.

CHORUS 3
Hush brothers! never tell,
Sure 'twill be quite as well
Not to discover
Men, 'reft of home delights,
Shivering these wintry nights,
Under the cover!

4.
Go ask the poor henpeck'd unfortunate wight,
If aught in the wide world can give him delight;
He sadly reverts to the days of his bliss,
And sighs that his birthright was sold for a kiss!

CHORUS 4
Hush brothers! never mind
Although our fate's unkind
Not yet to match us
Perhaps some gentle maid,
Not of gray hairs afraid
Slyly may snatch us!

5.
Then brothers be firm, to the rescue advance,
  A sigh is perdition-- there's death in a glance:
Yield no to the blast-- but be true to the last,
  And revel in age o'er the joys of the past.

CHORUS 5
Hush brothers! never fear,
Some aunt or sister dear
Shall for us pray
While some old hired nurse,
Maketh our ills the worse
For so much per day!
