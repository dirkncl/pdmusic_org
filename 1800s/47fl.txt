1. Now Ladies fair to you we’ll sing,
I, Juius, give dem bones a fling;
We’ll sing the minstrels’ parting lay,
So darkies, all now sing away.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Fare you well! Ladies, O!
Fare you well! Ladies,
Fare you well! Ladies,
Fare you well! Ladies,
We’re gwine to leave you now.

2. We’ve been all over the country though,
And seen things, both old and new;
But of all our very great desire,
Is to have de Ladies us admire!

3. O, Gembilmen! we thank you too,
For fatching de ladies long wid you,
To hear this darkie minstrel band,
Who sing and dance thoughout the land.

4. Whenever again we make a call
We’ll do our best to please you all:
One ting is sure, we’ll neber tire,
Unless some ob us should expire!
