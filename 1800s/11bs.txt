1.
Hail to the chief who in triumph advances
  Honour'd and blessed be the ever green pine.
Long may the tree in his banner that glances
  Hourish the shelter and grace of our line.
    Heav'n send it happy dew 
    Earth lend it sap anew 
  Gayly to bourgeon, as broadly to grow 
    While ev'ry Highland glee sends 
    Our shout back agen
"Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ierie!"

2.
Ours is no saplier, chance sown by the fountain,
  Blooming at Beltane, in Winter to fade;
When the whirlwind has stripped ev'ry leaf on the mountain,
  The more shall Clan Alpine exult in her shade.
    Moored in the rifted rock
    Proof to the tempests shock;
  Firmer he foots him, the ruder it blow;
    Menteith and beadalbane, then,
    Echo his praise again,
  "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"

3.
Proudly our pibroth has shrill'd in Glen Fruin,
  And Batochat's groans to our slogan rep'ied;
Glen Luss and Rossdhu, they smoking in ruin
  And the beast of Loch Lozond lie dead on he!
    Widow and Saxon Maid
    Long shall lament our raid,
  Think of Clan Alpine with fear and with woe;
    Lennox and Leven glen
    Shake when they hear agen,
  "Roderich Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"

4.
Row, Vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands!
  Stretch to your oars, for the ever green pine!
O! that the rose bud that graces you Islands,
  Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!
    O that some seedling gem
    Worthy such noble stem
  Honoured and blessed in their shadow might grow
    Loud should Clan Alpine then
    Ring from her deepmost glen
  Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!
