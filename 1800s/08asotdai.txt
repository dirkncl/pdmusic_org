"A Son of the Desert Am I" (1808)
Words by John P. Wilson
Music by Walter A. Phillips

1.
A son of the desert am I,
The iron clad hoofs of my horse spurn the sand.
The wide spreading desert is peaceful and grand;
My good lance at rest, at my side hangs my brand.
My brave Arab comrades come at my command.

For a son of the desert am I,
None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I,
None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I.

2.
I scoff at the Sybarite's case so secure,
Luxurious life I could never endure;
'Tis freedom I love, though the world be obscure.
The desert's wild grandeur alone can allure,
For a son of the desert am I.

None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I,
None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I.

3.
And I know that Zulica again awats in her tent,
The fairest in all the sunkiss'd Orient;
Whose form has the grace of the palm heaven-sent,
She will welcome her love when the storm-cloud is spent,
For a son of the desert am I,
For a son of the desert am I.

None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I,
None so dauntless and free on land or on sea,
For a son of the desert am I.
