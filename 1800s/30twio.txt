Arm Broth-ers arm! the Wolf the Wolf is out,
The Coun-try’s up and the Bow-men shout! 
The Shep-herd leaves his flee-cy care, 
The glo-rious sport of the day to share. 
Night is fled and the morn is grey 
Arm broth-ers arm to the chace a-way. 
Arm broth-ers arm to the chace a-way
to the chace to the chace a-way a-way! 
In yon-der thick-et close and dark
soft-ly tread and care-ful mark!
soft-ly tread and care-ful mark! 
’Tis there the Wolf is wont to prowl
and hark hark I hear hark! 
hark I hear the sa-vage sa-vage howl! 
Of-ten in the dead of night, 
When to sleep our toils in-vite, 
His hor-rid yell fond mo-thers hear 
And clo-ser press their in-fants dear! 
Hence to the field and the sa-vage soon
soon shall cease to bay the cloud-less Moon­­ 
No more no more to range to range our fields
for food or wel-ter in the  trav’-ler’s blood
no more to range our fields for food or wel-ter 
in the trav’-ler’s blood
no more to range our fields for food or wel-ter
in the trav’-ler’s blood
no more to range our fields for food or wel-ter
in the trav’-ler’s blood! 
The trav’-ler’s blood. 
The trav’-ler’s trav’-ler’s blood!
