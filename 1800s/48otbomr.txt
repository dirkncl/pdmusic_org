1. On the banks of Mystic river, 
When the moon sends forth its ray, 
To the cottage of Florella 
My footsteps oft  ten stray, 
’Tis there with many blessings 
I press her to my heart, 
While she with love confessing 
Act a’ winsome maiden’s part, 
  While she with love confessing 
  Acts a’ winsome maiden’s part.

2. Her eyes of sparkling lustre
Have a magic in their beam,
That binds my soul forever
To that cot beside the stream.
My youthful hopes aspiring
To more than manly pride,
Ne’er seek a better calling
Than to claim her as my bride.
  Ne’er seek a better calling
  Than to claim her as my bride.
