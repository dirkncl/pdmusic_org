1.
John Anderson my Jo John, when nature first began,
To try her canny hand John, her master work was man,
And ye among them a' John, sae trif frae tap to toe,
She prov'd to be na' journey work, John Anderson my Jo.

2.
John Anderson my Jo John, ye were my first conceit,
And ye need no' think it strange John tho'l ca' ye trim and neat;
There's some folk say ye're auld John, but I ne'er think ye so,
For ye are a' the same to me, John Anderson my Jo.

3.
John Anderson my Jo John, when we were first aquaint,
Your locks were like the raven John, your bonnie brow was breut,
But now yo're growning auld John, your locks are like the snow,
Yet blessings on that frosty pew, John Anderson my Jo.

4.
John Anderson my Jo John, frae year to year we've past,
And soon that year [manes?] come Johnm will bring us to our last;
But let not that affright us John, our hearts were ne'er our foe,
Tho' the days are gone that we have seen, John Anderson my Jo.

5.
John Anderson my Jo John, we've climb'd the hill thegither.
And many a cauty day John, we've had wi ane anither,
Now we may totter down John, but hand in hand we'll go,
And sleep thegither at the foot John Anderson my Jo.
