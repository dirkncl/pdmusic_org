1. I will tell you a tale, that was well known of old;
  But first let me see bumpers mounting,
For Wine, to a tale, warms the bosom that’s cold,
  When mix’d with the heart’s purple fountain—
Once the Gods form’d a ring— ’twas a Talisman rare—
  A bright crimson gem it’s cynosure,
Where Love lay conceal’d ev’ry breast to ensnare,
  And brilliants form’d the enclosure!
Now hey For the bottle:— that unsurpass‘d gem!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Sing ho For the wine’s ruby blushes
  Hurrah! For the circle around it, and then.—
Three Cheers— Three Cheers— Three Cheers—
  Three cheers for rich Wit’s sparkling gushes!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Three Cheers— Three Cheers— Three Cheers—
Three Cheers for rich Wit’s sparkling gushes!

2. “When the Ring was completed,” said Jove “on the earth,
  Cast the charms; and be joy theirs who catchit!
But a crown, gods, immortal shall cherish their worth
  Of him who’ll invent aught to match it.”—
Anacreon was passing; the treasure he found
  And to a symposiarch bore it;
Hence the sallies of love; wit; and learning profound,
  That flash’d from his pen when he wore it!

3. In our own matchless Isle, a fam’d Toper of yore,
  At length won Jove’s prize, with a cluster,
Of Sparks, who the title of “GENTLEMEN” bore.—
  A name which to worth adds a lustre!
These he rang’d round a bowl, beaming bright with red wine;
  Bound all with the garlands of pleasure,
Then ascened the skies, claim’d his horours divine,
  And to us, boys, transmitted the treasure!
