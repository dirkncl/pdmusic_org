[JANE]
1. 
Well, well, Sir! So, you’ve come at last! I thought you’d come no more; 
I’ve waited, with my bonnet on, From One ’till half past Four!— 
You know I hate to sit alone, unsettled where to go; 
You’ll break my heart,— I feel you will,— if you continue so! 
You’ll break my heart,— I feel you will,— if you continue so! 

[CHARLES]
2.
"Now pray, my love, put by that frown, and don't begin to scold!
You really will persuade me soon you're growing cross and old.--
I only stopp'd at Grosvnor gate, young Fanny's eye to catch;
I won't, I swear I _won't_ be made to keep time like a watch!
I won't, I swear I _won't_ be made to keep time like a watch!"

[JANE]
3.
"It took you, then, two hours to boy? Two hours!-- Take off your hat;
I wish you'd bow that way to _me_:-- and apropos of that,--
I saw you making love to her-- (You see I know it all!)
(Bis) I say you making love to her, at Lady Glossop's Ball!"

[CHARLES]
4.
"Now really, Jane, your temper is so _very_ odd To-Day!
_You_ jealous,-- and of such a Girl as little Fanny Gray!
Make love to _her_! Indeed, my dear, you could see no such thing;
(Bis) I sat a minute by her side, to see a turquoise ring!"

[JANE]
5.
"I tell you that I _saw_ it all, the whisp'ring and grimace,
The flirting and coquetting, in her little foolish face.
Oh! Charles I wonder that the Earth don't open, wher you stand--
(Bis) By the Heav'n that is above us both, I _saw you_ kiss her hand!"

[CHARLES]
6.
"I didn't, love! Or if I did,-- allowing that 'tis true,--
When a pretty woman shews her rings, what _can_ a poor man do?
My life, my soul, my darling Jane! I love but you alone
(Bis) I never _thought_ of Fanny Grey-- (How tiresome she's grown!)"

[JANE]
7.
"Put down your hat,-- don't take your stick!-- Now prithee, Charles, _do_ stay!
You never come to see me now, but you long to run away;
There was a time, there _was_ a time you never wish'd to go,--
(Bis) What have I done, what _have_ I done, dear Charles, to change you so?"

[CHARLES]
8.
"Pooh, pooh, my love! I am not chang'd,-- but Dinner is at Eight;
And my Father's so partcular, he never likes to wait;
"Good-Bye" Good-Bye! You'll come again? "Yes, One of these fine days!"
(Bis) "He's turn'd the Street,-- I knew he would-- He's gone to Fanny Grey's!"
