1. Stars of the summer night, 
Far, far, in your azure deeps; 
Hide, hide, you golden light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Moon of the summer night, 
Far down yon western steeps, 
Sink, sink in silver light, 
She sleeps my lady sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Sinks, sink, in silver light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps.

2. Wind of the summer night, 
Where yonder woodbine creeps, 
Fold, fold, thy pinnions light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Dreams of the summer night, 
Tell her, her lover keeps watch 
While in slumbers bright, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps, my lady sleeps, 
While, while in slumbers bright 
She sleeps my lady sleeps.
