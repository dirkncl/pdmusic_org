1.
O, has she den fail'd in her truth,
Dat beautiful nigger I adore,
Shall I neber again see dat face,
An view dat lov'd form any more.

CHORUS [after each verse]
Oh, Dine, Dine, Dine,
I dearly love you, Dine,
Oh, Dine, Dine, Dine,
I dearly love you, Dine,
Oh! Dine, Oh! Dine, Oh! Dine,
I dearly love you, Dine.

2.
My Cato is just gone out,
And you will have nothing to fear;
So open the door and come in,
An Dinah will meet you my dear.

3.
Now my Dinah, since faithful you proved,
I will cast off all thoughts of despair,
And each momemt of pleasure that's lost,
Is fresh in my mem'ry, my dear.
