1. We parted in silence,  we parted at night, 
On the banks of that lonely river, 
Where the fragrant pines their boughs unite, 
We met and we parted forever. 
The nightbird’s song and the stars above 
Told many a touching story 
Of friends long pass’d to the kingdom of love, 
Where the soul wears its mantle of glory, 
Where the soul wears its mantle of glory!

2. We parted in silence, our cheeks were wet 
With tears that were past controlling, 
And we vow’d that we’d never, no never forget, 
And the vows at the time were consoling, 
But the lips that echoed the vows of mine 
Are as cold as that lonely river, 
And the sparkling eye, the spirit’s shrine, 
Has shrouded its fire forever, 
Has shrouded its fire forever!

3. And now, on the midnight sky I look,
My heart grows full to weeping.
Each star is to me a sealed book,
Some tale of that lovely one keeping:
We parted in silence, we parted at night,
On the banks of that lonely river.
But the color and bloom of the byegone years
Shall hang o’er its waters forever,
Shall hang o’er its waters forever!
