1.
On the floating scow of old Virginny
  I toil'd from day to day,
A raking among the oyster beds
  It seemed to me like play
But now I feel, I'm getting old
  And cannot labor more,
So take me back to old Virginny
  To old Virginny shore.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
O take me back to old Virginny
  To old Virginny shore
O carry me back to old Virginny
To old Virginny shore.

2.
Oh! if I was but young again,
  I'd live a different life,
My money I'd save, and buy a farm
  And take me a nice young wife,
But now old age has got me fast,
  And my bones are growing sore;
So take me back to old Virginny,
  To old Virginny shore.

3.
O when I'm dead and gone to rest,
  Lay de Banjo by my side,
Let de Possom and Coon to de funeral come,
  For dey is my only pride.
And when I take my sweet repose,
  I'll dream for ever more,
Thay you laid my bones in old Virginny,
  On old Virginny shore.
