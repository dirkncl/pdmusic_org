SONG or GLEE.
Then fill the Goblet high, 
Rich rich with rosy wine, 
On pinions lightly fly, 
Th’ambrosial hours divine. 
Wine cheers the sadden’d mind, 
When close you press the brim, 
If Wine cheers the sadden’d mind, 
When close you press the brim, 
If deep you dip you’ll find, 
A rubied gem within, 
Then fill the goblet high, 
Rich, rich with rosy wine. 
On pinions lightly fly, 
Th’ambrosial hours divine, 
On pinions lightly fly, 
Th’ambbrosial hours divine, 
On pinions lightly fly, 
Th’ambbrosial hours divine.
