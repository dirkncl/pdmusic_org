[Alto]
A voice from the waves in the dead of night, 
Sung melodious o’er my pillow, 
As I lay on my couch in chamber light, 
Lull’d to rest by the heaving billow! 
It spoke not of human hopes and fears, 
That o’ercloud time’s hours flying, 
But it told of the dead of former years 
That in ocean’s bed were lying! 
A voice from the waves in the dead of night 
Sung melodious o’er my pillow, 
As I lay on my couch in slumber light, 
Lull’d to rest by the heaving billow! 
Lull’d to rest 
Lull’d to rest by the heaving, the heaving billow! 

[DUETT]
And thus it sung, 
And thus it sung, 
The voice, the voice from the waves, 
And thus it sung, 
And thus it sung, 
And thus— thus it sung— 

[Soprano]
“I come from the deep, I come from the deep, 
Where the sea flower gently uncloses, 
Where fiery youth hath a dreamless sleep, 
And the warrior in calmness reposes. 
Where the parent and child lie side by side, 
Doom’d by destiny ne’er to sever;— 
Where the husband fond, and his newmade bride, 
In death’s embrace are clasp’d for ever! 
Each wave rolls over the burial place 
Of earth’s children in countless numbers, 
Of ev’ry hue, and clime, and race 
where no tempest can break their slumbers— 
Of ev’ry hue, and clime, and race 
Where no tempest can break their slumbers.” 

[DUETT]
The voice was hush’d, the vision fled, 
But my heart felt a pang of sorrow, 
Till the daystar o’er thee, [me,] her bright beams shed, 
Commencing a glorious morrow! 
Till the daystar o’er me, her bright beams shed, 
Commencing a glorious morrow, 
Commencing, commencing a glorious, a glorious morrow, 
The voice was hush’d, the vision fled, 
The voice was hush’d, the vision fled.
