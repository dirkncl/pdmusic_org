1.
Have you heard the touching story,
Told so sadly of that clime?
Where the rose in crimson glory,
Brightens all the summer tme.
O it tells us of a maiden
Goldenhair’d and starry eyed,
Young in years, by thought o’erladen,
Who in angel beauty died;
[CHORUS 1]
Gentle EVA, loving EVA,
Sleeping by the sobbing wave,
Wait, or woe shall never grieve her,
Shrouded in her mossy grave.

2.
Once she wept o’er wrong and sorrow,
Childish tears so wisely shed;
Birds of Eden on the morrow,
Warbled dirges o’er her head.
Velvet leaf and snowy blossom,
Crown’d her young and radiant brow;
O’er her white, unheaving bosom,
Little hands are folded now.
[CHORUS 2]
Gentle EVA! loving EVA!
Sleeping by the moaning tide;—
Never more shall sorrow grieve her,
Who in angel beauty died.
