[SOLO]
I had a bud wid in my garden growing, 
A slip I cheris’d wid a father’s care, 
When other darkeyes round dat plant were hoeing, 
The zepher escence seem’d to fill de air. 
Oh how I watch’d dat little plant while creeping, 
She like a mother all was blyth and gay. 
One night I left her on her palate sleeping 
And in the morning she was stole away. 
One night I left her on her palate sleeping 
And in the morning she was stole away.
[CHORUS]
They stole, they stole, they stole my child away, 
they stole, they stole, they stole my child away. 
[SOLO]
Oh hear me now calling, Oh hear me I pray. 
My heart, my heart am breaking 
For my child, for my child they stole away. 
[CHORUS]
Oh, (hear that voice)
Oh, (hear that voice)
Oh,
I hear their hoofs ipon the hill. 
Her voice is growing fainter still. 
I hear their hoofs upon the hill. 
Her voice is growing fainter still. 
They stole, they stole, they stole my child away 
They stole, they stole, they stole my child away.
