1.
Long time ago there dwelt a maid
  In the Mississippi vale,
The prettiest gall I ever saw,
  Her name was Emma Dale.

DUETT [sung after each verse]
Oh Emma dear, dear Emma
From the Mississippi vale,
In all this world over,
There's none like Emma Dale.

CHORUS [sung after each DUETT]
Oh Emma dear, dear Emma
From the Mississippi vale,
In all this world over,
There's none like Emma Dale.

2.
The moon and stars were shining bright,
  The night when first we met;
'Twas there I told that lovely girl:
  I never could forget.

3.
I took her hand within my own,
  A tear was in her eye;
I asked her if she would be mine;
  Her answer was a sigh.

4.
I thought that we could never part,
  That nought would e'er assail;
But death alas! did take away:
  My own Emma Dale.
