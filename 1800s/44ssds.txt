REFRAIN
Sing, sing, darkies, sing,
Don't you hear the banjo ring,
Sing, sing, darkies, sing,
Sing for the white folks, sing.

1.
Since music am de meat ob love,
Made by old 'Pollo from above,
De sweetest witties, pb de kine,
Am in de darkies strain divine.

CHORUS
Sing, sing, darkies, sing,
Don't you hear the banjo ring,
Sing, sing, darkies, sing,
Sing for the white folks, sing.

Dar's Dandy Jim of Caroline,
And oder airs dat's quite as fine;
Dar's Danel Tucker, Lucy Neal,
Dat makes de frame all over feel.

(CHORUS)
