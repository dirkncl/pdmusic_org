1.
Were not the sinful Mary's tears
  An off'ring worthy Heav'n,
  An off'ring worthy Heav'n,
When o'er the faults of former years
  She wept and was forgiv'n?
  She wept and was forgiv'n?

2.
When, bringing every balmy sweet
  Her day of luxury stor'd,
  Her day of luxury stor'd,
She o'er her Saviour's hallow'd feet
  The precious perfume pour'd, --
  The precious perfume pour'd.

3.
And wip'd them with that goldern hair,
  Where once the diamond shone,
  Where once the diamond shone,
Though now those gems of grief were there,
  Which shine for God alone!
  Which shine for God alone!

4.
Thou that hast slept in error's sleep,
  Oh! wouldst thou wake in heaven,
  Oh! wouldst thou wake in heaven,
Like Mary kneel, like Mary weep,
  "Love much," and be forgiven!
  "Love much," and be forgiven!
