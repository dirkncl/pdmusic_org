Come brothers, Sons of Jove, 
With Nector brim each glass, 
The goblet drain till love 
Has pledg’d each fav’rite lass; 
Let friendship’s joys expand the soul, 
Let harmony its fears controul, 
Let Momus lead the jocund Glee 
Inspiring mirth and jollity. 
Then come my dear fellows let’s never despair, 
The god of the grape can dispell ev’ry care, 
Push round the brisk bowl, fraught with Nectar divine, 
Here’s a bumper to woman, to friendship and wine.
