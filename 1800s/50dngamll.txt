1.
  Come lend an ear, my lub, to me,
An listen to dis melody;
And harken to de strains so fine,
As all de darkies in chorus jine.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Do not go way, my lady-love,
Do not go way, my lady love,
Do not go way, my lady love,
But list to de banjo from above.
Do not go way, my lady-love,
Do not go way, my lady love,
Do not go way, my lady love,
But list to de banjo play.

2.
  Come my lub, an go wid me,
I'll buy a farm in de counteree;
Den wid my banjo by my side
You shall be my joy an pride.

3.
  Den we will lib like white folks fine,
I smoke de segar, you drink de wine,
You dance de Polka, while I sing,
An pick upon de banjo string.

4.
  Den come my lub an go wid me
An we'll lib in sweet felicity;
Den how happy we will be,
Wid our pickaninnies on our knee.
