1. Sing me to sleep, my mother,
  Sing, oh! sing me to sleep;
But why doest thou look so joyless?
  Mother, Oh! why doest thou weep?
They say the world above us
  Is brighter than this we leave,
’Tis there I’m going mother,
  Then why, oh! why shouldst thou grieve?

2. Sing me to sleep, my mother,
  Sing for I fain would go;
Thou know’st that I love thee, mother,
  Then why art thou weeping so?
The angels are calling me, mother,
  Those beings so radiant and bright,
Their voices are sweet, my mother,
  Their robes are glowing with light.

3. Doest thou not hear them, mother?
  They say to me “mortal arise!
And we’ll bear thee on wings of love,
  To our home beyond the bright skies.”
They say the earth is fair, mother,
  Yet its flowers but bloom to decay,
And oh! ’tis eternal springtime
  In the spiritland far away!

4. Sing me to sleep, my mother,
  Sing to me but once more,
Ere the spirit shall take its flight
  To that purer world to soar.
I know there’s a brighter world, mother,
  And I trust that world’s for me;
Think gladly of me when I’m gone,
  And in heaven I’ll watch o’er thee.
