1. I leave  my heart wi thee my love 
Tho forc’d from thee to stray 
Wi [rade?]kle grief I onward move 
And lonely take my way. 
How tedious will the hours appear 
Each day a year to me 
For ah! my love, my only dear, 
I leave my heart wi thee.

2. The fragrant wreaths my eyes invite 
Thy beauties smile around, 
In Roses red, in Roses white, 
Thy blooming sweets are found. 
Na o thers charms my mem’ can cheer 
Alike all seem ta me. 
For ah! my love, my only dear 
I leave my heart wi thee.

3. At my return ah may I find,
Thy strength defy auld time.
I’ll bring thee oelf that rules mankind,
E’er yet I’ve lost my prime.
Thy vows of truth alone can cheer,
Alone give bliss to me;
For ah my love, my only dear,
I leave my heart wi thee.
