"My Southern Home" (1849)
a Song
Written by J. W. Watson
for
John Ball Esqr.
and by him dedicated to his southern friends.
The Music composed by the late J. T. S. Sullivan.
Arranged for the Piano Forte by James Bellak.
from Daguerreotype by W. & F. Langenheim

This Song has peculiar interest from the circumstances under
which it was composed. Mr Sullivan was sitting at a Piano in
the wareroom of the Publisher a few days before his death when
these words were placed before him impromptu he sang it to
this beautiful air. Prof. Bellak pleased with tis sweetness
wrote as he sang the last production of this gifted man.

1. O that my heart would turn the air
The soft and sultry air
And on its swelling bosom rest
The dreams that lover there
Back to my lov’d, my Southern home.
Its wand’ring steps would wand
And bear those dreams, those loving dreams
to evry loving friend.

2. Come heartless bard of other years
Once breath’d a helpless strain
That absence conquers every tie
and love grows cold again
It may be thus but yet I know
My thought will fondly roam
Still though the dreams of the past
It finds my Southern home.
