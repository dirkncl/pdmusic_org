1. All bless the blue eyed maiden,
With curls of auburn hue,
Whose voice comes music laden
Those rosy portals through;
Though graceful, light and airy,
Too gentle to be vain,
All bless thee smiling fairy,
All bless thee blue eyed Jane;

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
All bless thee blue eyed maiden,
With curls of auburn hue,
Whose voice come music laden,
Those rosy portals through

2. Nay class me not with fairies,
From flow’r to flow’r they roam;
But Jane’s heart never varies
From friendship, Love, and home;
I envy nought above me,
No other boon I claim,
Save friends around that love me,
And call me blue eyed Jane,

3. Then once again all bless thee,
May joy and peace be thine,
And ne’er may lips address thee
With words less true than mine;
May each day ere it closers,
New blessings on thee rain,
And life show’r all its roses,
On pretty blue eyed Jane,
