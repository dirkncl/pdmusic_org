1. Way down in ole Carolina,
  A gal I met one day,
I ax'd de neighbors what's her name?
  Dey tell me Rosa May;
Her eyes dey shine like diamonds,
  Which caus'd my heart to beat,
And made me fall in lub wid her,
  Because she look'd so sweet.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh, dearest May, you're lubly as de day,
Your eyes so bright dey shine at night,
When de moon am gone away.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Oh dearest May, you're lubly as de day
Your eyes so bright dey shine at night,
When de moon am gone away.

2. I courted her for many a year,
  Ax'd her to be my bride,
She nebber said a single word,
  But turn'd her head aside;
Said I, "my dear 'tis berry clear
  I'll marry you to day;
If true to me, your lub I'll be,
  And you, my dearest May."

3. To church we went wid good intent,
  De preasher he was dare.
De ceremony being done.
  He made ob us a pair.
We dream ob true felicity;
  I'll ne'er forget de day,
When fortune and my happiness
  Was join'd wid Rosa May.
