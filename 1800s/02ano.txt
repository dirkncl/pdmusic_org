1. See the brighthair’d golden Sun.
Lead COLUMBIA’S BirthDay on;
Mark the once o’er— shadow’d soil,
Dress’d by Ceres, court his smile;
Mark the once o’er shadow’d soil,
Dress’d by Ceres, court his smile;

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
While the distant vales prolong
Sphere dear ended Freedom’s song
While the distant vales prolong.
Sphere decended Freedom’s song.

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Till each mountain’s timestruck head
Leave a valley in its stead,
as you are, forever, be,
independent, firm, and free.

2. Our fathers sought this land afar,
By the light of Freedom’s star;
Through trackless seas, unplough’d before,
For us they left their native shore;
The soil, for which their blood has flown,
Shall be protected with our own.

3. Beneath the gentle smile of peace,
In arts our fame shall rival Greece.
For power insatiate, let the car
Of wild Ambition rush to war;
We twine, beneath the Olive shade,
A wreath that age can never fade.

4. Lofty paeans strike the skies,
To the Power who give this praise;
While WACHUSETT lifts its head
O’er the plains on which you bled,
Yearly let its vales reply,
Freely live, or nobly die!
