1.
Now Niggers listen to me; a story I'll relate;
It happen'd in de valley, in the Old Carolina state;
Way down in de meadow, 'twas dare I mow'd de hay;
I always work de harder, when I think eb lubly Mae.

CHORUS 2 times
Oh! dearest Mae you'r lubly as the day,
Your eyes are bright, dey shine at night,
When de moon am gwane away!

2.
Old Massa gib me holiday, an' say he'll give me more,
I tank'd him bery kindly, an' shov'd my boat from shore;
So down de river I glides along, wid my heart so light and free,
To de cottage ob my lubly Mae, I'd long'd so much to see.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
On de banks of de river, whar de trees day hang so low,
De coon among thar branches play, while de mink he keep below;
Oh! dar is de spot an' Mae, she looks so neat,
Her eyes dey sparkle like de stars, her lips are red as beet.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
Benead de shady old oak tree, we sat for many an hour,
Happy as de Buzzard bird, dat flies about de flow'r;
But, oh, dear Mae, I leff her, she cried when boff we parted,
I bid sweet Mae a long farewell, and back to Massa started.

(CHORUS 2 times)
