1. Oh, I have had a dream, mother,
  So beautiful and strange;
Would I could sleep on, mother,
  And the dream never change!
What hast thou dreamt, my dear one?
  Thy look is bright and wild;
Thy mother's ear is ready,
  To listen to her child.

2. I dreamt I lay asleep, mother,
  Beneath an orange tree,
When a white bird came and sang, mother,
  So sweetly unto me;
Though it woke me with its warbling,
  Its notes were soft and low,
And it bade me rise and follow,
  Wherever it might go.

3. It led me on and on, mother,
  Through groves and realms of light,
Until it came to one, mother,
  Which dazzled--'rwas so bright.
As tremblingly I entered,
  And angel form drew near,
And bade me welcome thither,
  Nor pain nor sorrow fear.

4. I knew not aught there, mother,
  I only felt 'twas bliss,
And joined that white bird's song, mother,
  O canst thou read me this?
Yes, dearest to thy mother,
  Such happiness is given--
The Holy Spirit was that bird,
  That grove of light was Heaven!
