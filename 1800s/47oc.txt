1. Our Country! right or wrong,—
  What manly heart can doubt,
That thus should swell the patriot song,
  Thus ring the patriot shout:
Be but the foe array’d
  And Wars wild trumpet blown,
Cold was the heart who has not made
  His country’s cause his own.

2. Where e’er her flag unrolled
  Wooes the saluting breeze,
Flings o’er the plain its starry fold,
  Or float on stormy seas,—
All dearest thoughts are there,
  All that makes life divine,
Home, faith, the brave, the true, the fair,
  Cling to the flowing sign.

3. Though facttion rule the Halls
  Where nobler thoughts have sway’d,
One sacred voice for ever calls
  The patriots heart and blade;
He at his country’s name,
  Feels every pulse beat high,
Wreathes ’round her glory all his fame,
  And loves for her to die!

4. Oh! is this thought a dream?
  No! by the gallant dead,
Who sleep by hill, and plain, and stream,
  Or deep on ocean’s bed;
By every sacred name,
  By every glorious song,
By all we know and love of fame,—
  Our Country! right or wrong!
