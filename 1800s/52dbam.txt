1.
Don’t be angry, mother, mother,
Let thy smiles be of joy,
Don’t be angry, mother, mother
Don’t be angry with thy boy.
Years have flown since we travers’d
The dark and stormy sea,
Whils’t your boy quite broken hearted,
Ne’er has ceas’d to think of thee. 

2.
Don’t be angry mother, mother,
Let the world say what it will;
Tho’ I don’t deserve thy favour
Yet, I fondly love thee still.
We have liv’d and lov’d together,
Then our hearts ne’er knew a pain;
But, forgive me, mother, mother,
Oh forgive thy boy again.

3.
Pray remember, mother, mother,
I’ve been kneeling at thy feet,
And I’m dreaming of thee nightly
While reclining in my sleep.
But, forgive me, mother, mother,
It will cease thy heart of pain;
But, forgive me, mother, mother,
O forgive thy boy again.
