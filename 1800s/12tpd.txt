1. Enemies beware, keep a proper distance,
Else we'll make you stare at our firm resistance;
Let alone the lads who are freedom tasting,
Don't forget our dads gave you once a basting.
To protect our rights 'gainst your flint and triggers
See on yonder heights our patriotic diggers.
Men of ev'ry age, color, rank, profession,
Ardently engaged, labor in succession.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Pick-axe, shovel, spade, crow-bar, hoe and barrow
Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow.

2. Scholars leave their schools with patriotic teachers
Farmers seize their tools, headed by their preachers,
How they break the soil - brewers, butchers, bakers -
Here the doctors toil, there the undertakers.
Bright Apollo's sons leave their pipe and tabor,
Mid the roar of guns join the martial labor,
Round the embattled plain in sweet concord rally,
And in freedom's strain sing the foes finale.

3. Better not invade, don't forget the spirit
Which our dads displayed and their sons inherit.
If you still advance, friendly caution slighting,
You may get by chance a bellyful of fighting!
Plumbers, founders, dyers, tinmen, turners, shavers,
Sweepers, clerks, and criers, jewelers and engravers,
Clothiers, drapers, players, cartmen, hatters tailors,
Gaugers, sealers, weighers, carpenters and sailors!
