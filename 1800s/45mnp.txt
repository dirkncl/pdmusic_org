1.
Long long a-go I got ac-quaint-ed
  With a gall so strait and tall;
O! was-n't she a lub-ly crea-ture,
  And her name was Nan-cy Paul.

CHORUS [after each verse]
Miss Nanc-y's form all folks ad-mire,
She's six feet high, per-haps some high-er,
O! Nanc-y Paul - - - - -
O! Nanc-y Paul - - - - -
You're de hand-som-est gall ob de Nig-gers all,
O! Nanc-y Paul - - - - -
O! Nanc-y Paul - - - - -
She's de hand-som-est gall ob de Nig-gers all.

2.
I gib Miss Nanc and in-bi-ta-tion,
  To go and dance at a ball;
She laugh'd and said she;s ber-y wil-ling,
  So I danced with Nanc-y Paul.

3.
Since den I call'd on Nanc-y oft-en,
  I take her by her hand so small,
And look up in her spark-ling eyes
  And say I lub you Nanc-y Paul.

4.
She told me I had stole her 'fect-ions,
  Dat I must ber-y oft-en call
She said I was her dar-ling nig-ger,
  I said she_was my Nanc-y Paul.

5.
And now dear Nanc and I is mar-ried,
  De lit-tle chil-drens round us squall,
Dey sing we lub our dar-lin dad-dy,
  Be-cause he_mar-ried Nanc-y Paul.
