[SSB]
Merrily, merrily, bounds the bark, 
She bounds before the gale; 
The mountain breeze from Bennadarch, 
Is joyous in her sail! 

With flutt’ing sounds like laughter hoarse, 
The cords and canvas strain: 
The waves divided by her force, 
In rippling eddies chas’d her course, 
As if they laugh’d a gain. 

Merrily, merily bounds the bark, 
O’er the broad ocean driv’n; 
Her path by Ronin’s mountain’s dark, 
The steerman’s hand has giv’n.

[BASS SOLO]
And Ronin's mountains dark hae sent
Their hunters to the sea.

[SSB]
And each his ashen bow unbent, 
And gave his pasttime o’er. 

Merily, merrily, goes the bark, 
On a breeze from the northward free. 

[BASS]
So shoots thro’ the mornin’ sky the lark, 

[SSB]
Or the swim thro’ the summer sea. 

Merrily, merrily, goes the bark, 
Before the gale she hounds; 

[BASS]
So darts the dolphin from the shark,

[SSB]
Or the deer before the hounds— 

They pass’d not at Columbia’s isle, 
Tho’ peal’d the bells from the holy pile, 
With long and measure’d toll; 

No time for matin or for mass, 
And the sounds of the holy summons pas 
[SS]
Away in the billows’ roll,
[SSB]
Away in the billows roll. 

Ever the breeze blows merrily, merrily, 
Ever the breeze blows merrily. 

[BASS]
But the galley ploughs, no more the sea. 

[overlapping voices]
[BASS]
no more the see, But the
[S1]
But the galley ploughs, The
[S2]
But the

[SSB]
galley ploughs, no more the sea,
The galley ploughs, no more no more the sea.
