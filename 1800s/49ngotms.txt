[QUARTETTE]
Now gently o'er the moon-lit sea,
Glides our bark along
And as we near some friendly shore
Our joy bursts forth in song, bursts forth in song,
Our joy bursts forth in song,
[SOLO 1st SOP.]
And now the merry catch and glee are wafted on the wind,
And all is mirth and minstrelsy,
Our cares we leave behind,
Our cares we leave behind,
Our cares we leave behind,
[QUARTETTE]
A round we dash the spray
And hail the dawning day,
Of home the promis'd joys
Still cheer us on our way,
Of home the promis'd joys
Still cheer us on our way,
Still cheer us on our way,
Still cheer us on our way,
[SOLO 1st SOP.]
Sweet home blest home to mem'ry dear,
When far from thee we hie,
Can aught restrain the falling tear,
Or check the rising sigh,
Or check the rising sigh,
Or check the rising sigh,
[TRIO]
Yes! Yes! the joyous bounding main
As homeward points your prow,
Will bear us back to those lov'd scenes,
We fondly dream of now,
We fondly dream of now,
We fondly dream of now.
[SOLO 1st SOP.]
Around we dash the spray
And hail the dawning day of home
the promis'd joys still cheer us on our way
[QUARTETTE]
Then while we plough the heaving waves
careering midst their foam
Our thoughts, our hearts, will faithful veer
to man's best port his home,

[CHORUS with overlapping voices]
[1st SOP] Then while we plough the heaving waves careering midst their foam,
[2-4 SOP] home blest home sweet home to mem'ry dear,
[1st SOP] Our thoughts and hearts will faithful veer
To main's best port his home,
[2-4 SOP] Home sweet home blest
home sweet home,

[DUO, 2-3 SOP]
To man's best port
[QUARTET]
his home

[with overlapping voices]
[1st SOP] (home)
[2-4 SOP] Then merrily the catch and glee
we carrol as we go,

[1st SOP]
When all is mirth and minstrelsy,
[QUARTET]
To the wind our cares we throw,

[CHORUS with overlapping voices]
[1st SOP]
We carol as we go,
To the wind our cares we throw
We carol as we go
To the wind our cares we throw
We carol as we go
[2-4 SOP]
Sweet home blest home
to mem'ry dear sweet home blest home,
Home sweet home,
Home, sweet home,

[TRIO, 2-4 SOP.]
We carol as we go,
[1st SOP]
as we go
[CHORUS]
To the wind our cares we throw.
