What are mortals made of?
By Analization I've tried all the nation,
defin'd each gradation to every station;
With Sir Humphrey's best, new chemical test,
And found what mortals are made of.

1.
What are our Lawyers made of?
 What are our Lawyers made of?
Of Causes and fees, demurrers and pleas,
Learned Brother and lots of pother,
Counsel and jury with very wise looks,
Flaw in the indictment and statue books,
Such are our Lawyers made of,
 Such are our Lawyers made of.

2.
What are our old Maids made of?
 What are our old Maids made of?
Of thrown away sighs, and crows feet eyes,
Of sprigs of rue and vinegar too;
Parchment skin and faltering walk,
Chit Chat and slander to talk;
And such are our old Maids made of.
 And such are our old Maids made of.

3.
What are old Bachelors made of?
 What are old Bachelors moad of?
Of bread and cheese and very weak knees,
Of snivelling nose, and rheumatic toes,
Domestic confort they say is all strife,
But yet in their hearts that all long for a wife;
And such are old Bachelors made of.
 And such are old Bachelors made of.

4.
What are our young Ladies made of?
 What are our young Ladies made of?
Of flounces and frill their beaux for to kill,
Of heaving a sigh till they make the men die,
A nice little frill, and a nice little fan,
And all for the get them a nice little man;
And such are our young Ladies made of.
 And such are our young Ladies made of.

5.
What are our Dandies made of?
 What are our Dandies made of?
Of wristbands and collars but very few dollars,
A glass to the eye when a lady is by,
False collar, calves, and hair,
Stays laced and head like a bear;
And such are our Dandies made of.
 And such are our Dandies made of.

6.
What are New Yorkers made of?
 What are New Yorkers made of?
Of state house in park, broadway in the dark,
Of ladies who flash, and cut such a dash,
The home of the stranger delight of the brave,
Lots of frolic, and fashion, and brokers that shave;
And such are New Yorkers made of.
 And such are New Yorkers made of.

7.
What are Philadelphians made of?
 What are Philadelphians made of?
Of dandies and quakers, and germans and shakers,
Of fine schulhill coal, and chad by the shoal,
At the mint they make money, oh lawks what a pile,
And the market it reaches for nearly a mile;
And such are Philadelphians made of.
 And such are Philadelphians made of.

8.
What are Bostonians made of?
 What are Bostonians made of?
Of shrewdness I thank ye', the name of a yankee,
A fine snowy day, and a very good sleigh,
Who a few years ago under liberty tree,
Swore they'd rather be darn'd than be tax'd for their tea,
And such are Bostonians made of.
 And such are Bostonians made of.
