1. Dey may talk ob dandy Niggers,
But dey neber see dis coon,
A prombernarding Broadway
On a Sunday arternoon
Ise de sole delight ob yellow gals
De envy ob de men,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For Ise de grit de go de cheese
As ebry one may tell,
De dark fair sex
Ise sure to please
Ise de Dandy Broadway swell.

2. My new sack coat am padded,
Just to make my shoulders broad;
You’d tink I was jew peter,
You would upon my word.
I sometime wear musashers,
But I loss em toder day,
For de glue was bad de wind was high
And so dey blow’d away. 

3. I sports a double eye glass,
Dat shuts up in a case,
A brack silk stock ac cause it suits,
De spressione ob dis face.
My linen cuffs an collar too
Look brutfully white,
And so by gosh I tink dey ought,
For I wash em ebry night.

4. I wears a gold wash’d guard chain,
Dat I bought ob Uncle Pete,
But I left de watch for safety,
Wid a man in Chatham street.
Wid grobes, an cane, an fancy vest,
French trowserloons an hat,
Wid gran imperial which I cut,
From de tail ob our brack Cat.

5. I radder tink Miss Chloe White,
Am growing quite forlorn,
I hears it in her dulcet woice,
As she sweetly cries “Hot Corn.”
She’s up to de eyes in lub wid me,
An so am twenty more,
For Ise sitch a gay deceiver,
As dey neber seed before.

6. Dis Niggers name am Cesar,
Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown,
De biggest bug de greatest coon,
Dat eber walk’d dis town.
So take car Gals an mind your sefs;
For if I roll dis eye,
Youll gib a shake, a sigh an groan,
An den flop down an die.
