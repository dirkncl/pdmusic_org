1.
'Twas in a slash Wir ginny break,
Sambo lib, dat some call Jake;
Round de world you'd hear de ring.
Ob de reglar roarer he would sing.

Come my Dinah darling!

For I'm goin' ober de mountain.

Push de ole horse on like mad,
Wop him till he grin quite glad;

Didn't rain altho' it freeze,
Waited a week to find his breath,
Dat was de cause of ole horse death.

Say him die wid da "ear ache" in his tail.

None so happy as Dinah and me.
