1. Sleep baby mine! enfolded in this bosom,
  Thy cries they pierce again this bleeding breast;
Sleep baby mine! not long thou’st have a mother
  To lull thee fondly in her arms to  rest.
  To lull thee fondly in her arms to  rest.

2. Poor wayward wretch! and who will heed thy weeping,
  When soon an outcast on the world thou’lt be;
Who then will sooth thee when thy mother’s sleeping,
  In her low grave of shame and infamy!
  In her low grave of shame and infamy!

3. Sleep, baby mine! tomorrow I must leave thee,
  And I would snatch an interval of rest;
Sleep these last momoents, e’er the laws bereave thee,
  For never more thou’lt press a mothers breast.
  For never more thou’lt press a mothers breast.
