1. Tell him I love him yet, 
As in that joyous time! 
Tell him I ne’er forget; 
Though mem’ry’s now be mine! 
Tell him when fades the light 
Upon the earth and sea, 
I dream of him by night 
He must not dream of me!

2. Tell him to smile again
In pleasure’s dashing throng—
To wear mother’s chain,
To praise another’s song!
Before the lovliest there,
I’d have him bend the knee,
And breathe to her the prayer
He used to breathe to me!

3. Tell him, that day by day,
Life looks to me no more dim.
I falter when I pray,
Although I pray for him,
And bid him when I die,
Come to my fav’rate tree.
I shall not hear him sigh
THEN let him sigh for me!
