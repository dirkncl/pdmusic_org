1.
This book is all that's left me now.
Tears will unbidden start!
With faltering lip and throb[b]ing brow,
I press it to my heart,
For many generations passed
Here is our Family tree;
My Mother's hands this bible clasped,
She dying gave it me.
  My Mother's hands this bible clasped,
  She dying gave it me.

[2.]
Ah, well do I remember those
Whose names these records bear;
Who round the hearth-stone used to close,
After the eve-ning pray'r;
And speak of what these pages said,
In tones my heart would thrill;
Tho' they are with the silent dead,
Here are they living still!
  Tho' they are with the silent dead,
  Here are they living still!

2. [3.]
My father read this holy book
To Brother's, Sisters dear,
How calm was my poor mother's look,
Who learned God's word to hear,
Her angel face I see it yet
What vivid memories come
Again that little group is met
Within the halls of home.
  Again that little group is met
  Within the halls of home.

[4.]
Thou truest friend man ever had
Thy constancy I've tried
When all were false I found thee true,
My counsellor and guide.
The mines of Earth no treasure give,
That could this volume buy;
In teaching me the way to live,
It taught me how to die.
  In teaching me the way to live,
  It taught me how to die.
