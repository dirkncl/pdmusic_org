Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
  Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
  Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
How like art thou to joy remember'd well!
A nightbeam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
Distinct, but distant--clear, but oh how cold!
