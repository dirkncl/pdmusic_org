1. Thou art beautiful as flow’rs
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
E’en the fairest in my bow’rs
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
And the azure brow of night,
With its starty wreaths of light,
Hath not eyes more pure and bright
  Than are thine, Than are thine.

2. Thou art fair as mountain snows
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
E’er the sun upon them glows
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
But the noontide hath its ray,
And the snowflakes melt away,
And hearts— why may not thine?
  Why not thine? Why not thine?

3. Thou art fair as any queen
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
As the moon’s resplendent sheen
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
But the moonbeams fade and die
Like love’s unheeded sigh,
And my hopes in sorrow lie
  Lady mine! Lady mine!
