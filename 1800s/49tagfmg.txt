1.
Thou art gone from my gaze,
Like a beautiful dream,
And I seek thee in vain,
By the meadow and stream;
Oft I breathe thy dear name,
To the winds floating by,
But thy sweet voice is mute to my bosom's lone sigh.
In the stillness of night,
When the stars mildly shine,
My heart fondly holds a communion with thine;
For I feel thou art near,
And where'er I may be,
That the Spirit of Love keeps a watch o'er me.

2.
Of the birds in thy bow'r
Now, companions I make;
Every simple, wild flow'r
I prize for thy sake;
The deep woods and dark wilds,
Can a pleasure impart,
For their solitude suits
My sad, sorrow worn heart.
Thou art gone from my gaze,
Yet I will not repine,
Ere long we shall meet
In the home that's now thine;
For I feel thou art near,
And where'er I may be,
That the Spirit of Love keeps a watch o'er me.
