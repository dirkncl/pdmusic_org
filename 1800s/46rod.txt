1. You will see us on our way, bime bye, bime bye, 
O ’t’ill be a happy day, bime bye. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ride on Darkies, oh ride on; 
We’re on our journey home. 
O! Ride on Darkies, oh ride on; 
We’re on our journey home.

2. You will see us once again, bime bye, bime bye;
And we’ll sing you dis ere strain, bime bye.

3. We shall think upon you long, bime bye, bime bye;
You will think upon our song, bime bye.

4. Hope you feel as we shall feel, bime bye, bime bye;
When de mem’ry round us steal, bime bye.

5. We shall be away off far, bime bye, bime bye;
Shining like de ebening star, bime bye.

6. Good night ladies, gemmans too, till bime bye, bime bye;
Now we bid you all adieu, wid a sigh.
