O steal not the ray o’er my fond beating breast, 
To the winds, the fond hope let me give, 
Too bright to be lasting, too lovely to rest, 
Where sorrow forever must live. 
Oh steal not the ray o’er the fond beating breast, 
To the winds, to the winds the fond hope let me give, 
Too bright to be lasting, too lovely to rest, 
Where sorrow forever must live, 
Where sorrow forever must live. 

Yes, yes in his bosom of woe, 
Still cherish’d his image shall be, 
And sweet is the tear that shall flow, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee, 
And sweet is the tear that shall flow, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee, 
Yes, yes in this bosom of woe, 
Still cherish’d his image shall be, 
And sweet is the tear that shall flow, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee, 
Yes, yes in this bosom of woe, 
Still sherish’d his image shall be, 
And sweet is the tear that shall flow, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee, 
Fond youth in remembrance of thee.
