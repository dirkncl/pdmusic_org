1. Hear my friends a story
All the world should know—
How the Yankees’ glory
Spread thro’ Mexico!
To the ball advancing,
All in bright array,
The Yankees had the dancing
But for the music they made us pay!

2. When the ladies listened
To their martial air,
How their dark eyes glistened
In the whirl to share!
But in vain their glancing,
Beauty had no sway;
The Yankees had the dancing
But for the music they made us pay!

3. All the men most bravely
Vowed they’d have a turn
But they gave up gravely
Steps they could not learn.
Awkwardly advancing,
Soon they turn’d away:
The Yankees had the dancing
But for the music they made us pay!

4. Champions of the nation—
Guards! why were ye not
True to your vocation
Paying off the Scott?
Hah! ye were enhancing
Shame upon the day!
The Yankees had the dancing
But for the music they made us pay!

[original Mexican lyrics]
1. Ay! amigos mios
Les voy a contar
Lo que meha pasado
En esta cuidad.
En tra ron los yankees
Me arries gue a'pedrear
A la pasadita tarantararin tarindarin.

2. Solo las mugeres
Tienen corazon
Para hacer alianza
Con esa nacion:
Y ellas dicen: Vamos.
Pero no es verdad,
A la pasadita
Tarantararin tarindarin.

3. Solo de los hombres
No hay que deconfiar,
Pues lo que ellos hacen
No lo hacen por mal:
Suelen como el gato
Tambien halagar,
Y a la pasadita
tarantararin tarindaran.

4. Ay! amigos mios,
Guardia nacional,
A tomar las armas
Con puntualidad:
Y ellos dicen: TIAGUI
Pero, no es verdad
A la pasadita
tarantarin tarindaran.
