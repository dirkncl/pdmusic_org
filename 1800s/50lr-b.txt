1. Little Rose is full of mischief, 
Laughing all the livelong day, 
Merry as a chirping cricket, 
That ’mid flowers loves to stray, 
Ringlets floating round her forehead, 
Give her such a dreamy air; 
Lips that seem to say, just parted, 
“Come and kiss me if you dar.”

2. Little Rose is fresh and blooming, 
How ideal is her form; 
Gentle, kind and full of goodness, 
And a heart that’t fresh and warm. 
Then her voice, so sweet and winsome, 
O, it is some fairy dream! 
Tones like silver, linger round me, 
Like the music of a stream.

3. Little Rose lives in a cottage,
All embowered in a dell;
Front of white, and wall of woodbine,
Where the linnets love to dwell.
Here ’mid beauty, Rose is happy,
Sunshine, flowers, leaves of green,
Revelling in pomp of nature—
One more happy ne’er was seen.
