1. (Solo) Bella Rosa! tender flower! 
Come and cheer this darkey’s heart; 
I am thine, and from this hour, 
Nebber, nebber let us part! 
(Chorus) Bella Rosa! Bella Rosa! 
(Solo) Bella Rosa! Say you lub me! 
One sweet word afore we part; 
Come, oh! come and say you lub me! 
Bella,— darling ob my hear! 

CHORUS (sung after each verse]
Bella Rosa, Bella Rosa! 
Smile again, oh! darling one! 
Pearly teeth and witching eye, 
Oh, Bella Rosa! smile again. 
Bella Rosa! Bella Rosa!

2. (Solo) Bella Rosa! dance so lightly,
Plain quadrille or piginwing;
If, like me, you see her nightly,
Just like me you’d sit and sing,—
(Chorus) Bella Rosa! Bella Rosa!
(Solo) Bella Rosa! come, sit near me,
I have something sweet to say;—
Bella says, “her mother heam me—
Wait, then, ’till some odder day,”—

3. (Solo) Bella Rosa! sing so sweetly,
Sets my soul on fire again;—
Plays her tight Guitar so neatly—
Off I go a singing then—
(Chorus) Bella Rosa! Bella Rosa!
(Solo) Bella Rosa! listen to me
Shall, oh! shall the day be set;
Bella, smile and whisper to me,—
“Couldn’t leave her mammy yet,”—

4. (Solo) Bella Rosa! tender flower!
I will tend thee, waiting ever,—
’Till the bud of morning hour
Blossoms, blessing me forever!
(Chorus) Bella Rosa! Bella Rosa!
(Solo) Then in bliss forebber living,
Hearts like ours shall know no plain;
Bella’s love each pleasure giving,
Brings all gladness back again,—
