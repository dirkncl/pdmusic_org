1. We’ve formed our band and we’re all well mann’d,
To journey afar to the promised land;
Where the golden ore is rich in store,
On the banks of the Sacramento shore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then ho, Boys ho! to California go;
There’s plenty of gold in the world we’re told
On the banks of the Sacramento.
||: Heighho! and away we go,
Digging up the gold on the Francisco. :||

2. As off we roam through the dark sea foam,
We’ll ne’er forget kind friends at home.
But memory kind shall bring to mind
The love of those we left behind.

3. We expect our share of the coarsest fare,
And sometimes sleep in the open air.
On the cold damp ground we’ll all sleep sound
Except when the wolves come howling ’round.

4. As we explore the distant shore
We’ll fill our pockets with the shining ore
And how ’twill sound as the word goes ’round
Of our picking gold by the “dozen pound.”

5. O, the gold is thar most any whar
And they dig it out rich with an iron bar
And where ’tis thick, with a spade or pick
They’ll take our lumps as “big as a brick!”
