1. Long ’fore dis time, dis darky dwelt 
In a place call’d Tuscanoe, 
I lov’d a girl with towny skin, 
Her name was Cynthia Sue.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Oh! Cynthia, Cynthia, Cynthia, Sue, 
Oh! Cynthia, Oh! Cynthia, 
I lubs no gal but you.

2. I put my arm around her neck,
I did’en’t mean to harm her.
She wouldn’t let me kiss her,
If de Banjo diden’t charm her. 

3. She fainted when I told her,
“I love you Cynthia Sue”
I fann’d her wid de Banjo,
But I coulden’t fetch her too.

4.  Brutus sleep awake all night,
And eat no witials too,
She lib on air— and dat are air,
War dis “Oh Cynthia Sue.”

5. Dey took me down de ribber
De flood was high, ’tis true,
But I made it five feet higher,
When I wept for Cynthia Sue.
