1. Oh let those Magin Eye's of thine;
Lady, upon another shine,
Though but in seeing thee I live,
Those eyes, those eyes my death wound give.
Eyes that such wondrous art possess 
Should guarded be with carefullness,
For when they do but glance at me,
Vainly I strive to gaze on thee.

2. 'Tis thus that love and fate ordain,
That which is guerdon for my pain,
Should but add fuel to my grief,
And to my woes bring no relief.
From those dear eyes I light receive
'Tis only in their light I live,
Yet when they do but glance at me,
Vainly I strive to gaze on thee.
