1 Go fetch to me a pint o’ wine 
An’ fill it in a silver tassie 
That I may drink before I go 
A service to my bonnie Lassie; 

2. The boat rocks at the pier o’ Leith; 
Fúloud the wind blaws frae the ferry; 
The ship rides by the Berwick law, 
And I maun leave my bonnie Mary 

3. The trumpets sound, the banners fly,
The glitt’ring spears are ranked ready;
The shouts o’ war are heard afar,
The battle closes thick and bloody;

4. But it’s not the roar o’ sea or shore
Wad make me longer wish to tarry;
Nor shouts o’ war that’s heard afar,
It’s leaving thee, my bonnie Mary.
