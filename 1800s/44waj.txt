1. All de way from ole Carlina
For to see my old Aunt Dinah,
Says I ole lady how's de goose,
De Jay bird jump on de Martin's roost.

[CHORUS]
Walk along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.

2. Went behind her house on my knees,
I tink I hear de gobler sneeze
De gobler jump on de pumkin vine,
De goose char backer, de duck drink wine.

[CHORUS]
Walk along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.

3. Milk in de dairy nine days old,
De rats an skippers gettin mitey bold,
Long tail rat in a pail of souse,
Just come down from white man's house.

[CHORUS]
Get along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.

4. Ginny nigger raised a hog,
He make his canoe of de log,
He put his canoe in de water,
Go your death I see your dauter.

[CHORUS]
Go along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.

5. I hadn't seen her haf a day
Till my distresses I did pay,
Shy at fust but soon got larkin,
De Ginny gals am deth on sparkin.

[CHORUS]
Get along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.

6. Massa sent me out a singin,
Dat was de fust ob my beginin;
I shake de dubble simonquivers
And bust de banjo all to shivers.

[CHORUS]
Walk along John, de fifer's son,
Aint you glad your day's work's done.
