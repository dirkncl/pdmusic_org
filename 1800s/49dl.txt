1. Can I forget de day,
Oh! neber,
When I first saw my Dinahs face,
By de Missisippi; riber
As She walk’d wid sick a grace,
Could I tink dat sich a figgur,
Ebber could be false an bad;
It am enough to drive dis Nigger,
Tentotally rading mad.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Oh! false Dinah,
Cruel Gal, my Ghost shall haunt you, dat he shall.

2. More dan two weeks her I courted,
Bought her eb’ry ting was good;
She swore to lub me as we sported,
An I raly thought she would;
But alas! behine de stable,
I cotch’d her kissing Sambo White;
I swore as hard as I was able,
To brown myself dat berry nite.

3. All dat nite I rav’d an tore Sar,
My bran new trowserlooms an shirt;
I nebber did sich tings before Sar,
But my mind was berry much hurt.
Massa hearing sitch a riot,
Fotch’d wid him de large Cow hide;
He wallop’d me to make me quiet,
Till I thought I should had bied.

4. To de Squire’s nex day went Dinah,
Sambo he was by her side;
Six Yaller Bridesmaids walk’d behine her,
How I longd to kick de bride:
Three Pickaninies now dey’ve got Sar,
An I’m told will soon hab four;
Pitty den dis Nigger’s lot Sar,
For I can nebber see her more.
