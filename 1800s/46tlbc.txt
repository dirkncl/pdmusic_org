1. When first I saw sweet Peggy,
'Twas on a market day,
A Low-backed car she drove, and sat
Upon a truss of hay;
But when the hay was blooming grass,
And deck'd with flow'rs of spring,
No flow'r was there
That could compare
To the blooming girl I sing,
  As she sat in her low-backed car,
  The man at the turnpike bar,
Never ask'd for the toll
But just rubb'd his owld poll,
  And look'd after the low-backed car!

2. In battle's wild commotion,
The proud and mighty Mars
With hostile scythes demands his tythes
Of Death, in warlike cars!
But Peggy peaceful goddess,
Has darts in her bright eye,
That knock men down,
In the market town,
As right and left they fly!
  While she sits in her low-back car,
  Than battle more dang'rous far,
For the doctor's art
Cannot cure the heart
  That is hit from that low-backed car.

3. Sweet Peggy round her car, sir,
Has strings of ducks and geese,
But the scores of hearts she slaughters,
By far outnumber these;
While she among her poultry sits,
Just like a turtle dove,
Well worth the cage,
I do engage
Of the blooming God of Love.
  While she sits in her low-backed car,
  The lovers come, near and far,
And envy the chicken
That Peggy is pickin'
  While she sits in her low-backed car!

4. I'd rather own that car, sir,
With Peggy by my side,
Than a coach and four, and gold _galore_*, 
And a lady for my bride;
For the lady would sit _forninst_+ me,
On a cusion, made with taste,
While Peggy would be beside me
With my arm around her waiste.
  As we drove in the low-backed car
  To be married by Father Maher.
Oh my heart would beat high,
At her glance and her sigh,
  Tho' it beat in a low-backed car.
