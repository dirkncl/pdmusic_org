1. God bless our native land--
Firm may she ever stand
Through storm and night;
When the wild tempest rave,
Ruler of wind and wave,
Do Thou our country save
By Thy great might.

2. For her our prayers shall rise
To God above the skies--
On Him we wait:
Thou who art ever nigh,
Guarding with watchful eye,
To Thee aloud we cry,
God save the state!

3. And not to us alone,
But be Thy mercies known
From shore to shore:
Lord, make the nation see
That men should brothers be,
And form one family
The wild world o'er.

1. My country, 'Tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing:
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrim's pride,
From ev'ry mountain side
Let freedom ring.

2. My native country thee,
Land of the noble free--
Thy name I love:
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above.

3. Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake,
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence brake,
The sound prolong.

4. Our fathers' God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God our King.
