1. When I was young and in my prime,
  I lov’d sweet Jenny Lane;
She return’d my love and since dat time,
  Has nebber caus’d me pain,
Her voice it sound so sweet and clear,
  As on my ear it came;
The thrilling tones went to my heart,
  When spoke by Jenny Lane.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Strike the chords! Sound the horns!
Jenny’s dead and gone,
No more she’ll hear de banjo’s strain,
Pretty Jenny Lane.

2. Now time flew be, we both got old,
  Dear Jenny Lane and I;
She den to me the story told,
  Dear Joe I’se gwine to die.
Her eyes grew dim for death drew near,
  And with it sorrow came;
It took from me my only love,
  My own dear Jenny Lane.

3. And oft when evening gathers round,
  I seek dat sacred spot;
With tears I strew the grassy mound,
  And mourn my lonely lot.
The weeping willow covers her,
  I know she’s free from pain;
But oh! I feel dis heart will break,
  For my dear Jenny Lane.
