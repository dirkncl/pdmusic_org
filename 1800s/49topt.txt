1. Oh! darkies now I’m gown to sing 
De truth to you I’ll tell. 
Oh happy days dat I hab seen 
Wid my dear Nancy Bell. 
Oh! I wish dat I was back again 
Way down in Tennisee 
Wid my dear Nancy by my side 
Beneath the old pine tree.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
’Tis many a night since first we met 
’Neath dat old pine tree 
An dar we told our tales ob lub, 
How happy we shall be.

2. My lub has left me long ago.
Whar she is, no one can tell.
An’ I am nearly crasy now
For my dear Nancy Bell.
But I dreamt last night when all was still
Dat she’d come back to me
An’ I would yet see happy days
Beneath the old pine tree.

3. I quite forgot, I was so old.
It seems to me a dream
Dat three score years hab past and gone
Since I was seventeen.
But everything  is right at last,
An’ Nancy is true to me.
An’ when we die, oh let us rest
Beneath de old pine tree.
