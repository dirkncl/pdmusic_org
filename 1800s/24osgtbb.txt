1.
[TREBLE]
O swifttly glides the bonny boat,
Just parted from the shore;
And to the Fisher's glorious note,
Soft moves the dipping oar:
These toils are borne with happy cheer,
And ever may they speed;
That feeble age and helpmate dear,
And tender bairuies feed.

[sung after each verse]
[TREBLE]
We cast our lines in Largo bay,
Our oars are floating wide;
[DUO]
Our bonny boat with yielding sway,
Rocks lightly on the tide
[CHORUS]
And happy prove our daily lot,
Upon the summer sea;
And blest on land our kindly cot,
Where all our treasures be.

2.
[TREBLE]
The Mermaid on her rock may sing,
The Witch may weave her charm;
Nor Water-sprite, nor eldrick thing,
The bonny boat can harm:
It safely bears its scaly store,
Thro' many a stormy gale;
While joyful shouts rise from the shore,
Its homeward prow to hail.
