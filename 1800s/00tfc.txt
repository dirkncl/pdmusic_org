1. Poets my dream of their Helicon streams 
Their Gods and their Heroes are fabulous dreams, 
Their Gods and their Heroes are fabulous dreams.
  They ne’er sang a line
  Half so grand, so divine, 
  As the glorious toast 
  We Columbians boast, 
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION boys and LIBERTY for ever; 
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION boys and LIBERTY for ever.

2. ADAM’S, the man of our choice, guides the helm,
No tempest can harm us, no storm overwhelm;
No tempest can harm us, no storm overwhelm:
  Our sheer anchor’s  sure
  And our bark rides secure,
  So here’s to the toast
  We Columbians boast,
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, and the PRESIDENT for ever.
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, and the PRESIDENT for ever.

3. A free Navigation, Commerce and Trade,
We’ll seek for no foe of no foe be afraid,
We’ll seek for no foe of no foe be afraid,
  Our frigates shall ride
  Our defence and our pride;
  Our Tars guard our coast
  And huzzah to our toast
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, TRADE and COMMERCE boys for ever.
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, TRADE and COMMERCE boys for ever.

4. MONTGOMERY, WARREN, still live in our songs,
Like them our YOUNG HEROES shall spurn at out wrongs,
Like them our YOUNG HEROES shall spurn at out wrongs,
  The world will admire
  The zeal and the fire
  Which blaze in the toast
  We Columbians boast
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION and its ADVOCATES for ever.
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION and its ADVOCATES for ever.

5. When an enemy threats all party shall ceace,
We bribe no intriguers to buy a mean peace,
We bribe no intriguers to buy a mean peace,
  Columbians will scorn,
  Friend or foe [& are torn?],
  We’ll ne’er [train?] the toast
  Which as free men we boast
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION and INTEGRITY for ever.
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION and INTEGRITY for ever.

6. FAME’S trumpet shall swell in WASHINGTON’S praise,
And TIME grant a furlough to lengthen his days,
And TIME grant a furlough to lengthen his days,
  May health weave the thread
  Of delight round his head;
  No nation can boast
  Such a name— such a toast—
[REFRAIN]
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION boys and WASHINGTON for ever.
The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION boys and WASHINGTON for ever.
