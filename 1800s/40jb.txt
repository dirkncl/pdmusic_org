1. As I went up to Lynchburg town, 
I broke my yoke on de coaling ground; 
I drove from dare to bowling spring, 
And tried for to mend my yoke and ring. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
O Johnny Boker help dat nigger do 
Jonny Boker do.

2. I drove from dare to Wright’s ole shop.
Hollered to my driver and told him to stop.
Says I, “Mr. Wright have you got a yoke?”
He seized his bellows and blew up a smoke.

3. Says I, “Mr. Wright hab’nt long for to stay.”
He cotched up his hammer, knocked right away,
Soon as he mended my staple and ring.
Says I, “Mr. Wright, do you charge for any thing?”

4. Says he to me, “I never charge
Unless de job is verry large.
For little jobs dat is so small,
I neber charge for any ting at all.”
	_(Save three cents dat time.)_

5. I drove from dar to Anthony’s Mill
And tried to pull up dat are hill.
I whipped my steers and pushed my cart.
But all I could do, I could’nt make a start.
	_(De ole nigger was fast stalled dat time.)_

6. I put my shoulder to the wheel.
Upon the ground I placed my heel.
Den we make a mighty strain.
But all our efforts prove in vain.

7. Dare cum a waggoner driving by.
I sat on de ground and ’gan for to cry.
Says me to him, “some pity take
And help me up for conscience sake.”

8. Says he to me, “I will help thee.”
He tuk out his horses No. 3.
I wiped from my eyes the falling tears.
He hitched his horses before my steers.

9.   Den to me he did much please.
He pulled me up wid so much ease.
His horses were so big and strong.
De way dey pulled dis nigger along.
