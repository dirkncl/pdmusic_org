1.
I once did know a yellow girl, for her I once did sigh.
I tought that we could make a match just like a hook and eye.
I ax'd her if she'd have me, when she gave me such a look;
I really tought she would say "yes," she said it with a hook.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh Katy Oh Katy, 
Dont marry any oder,
You'l brake my heart indeed you will,
Den you'l be hung for murder.

2.
One night she went a walking out with Sam Jemimon Bow'rs.
Dey went down in the buckwheat fields, among the crimson flow'rs;
He said dat he would give his love if she'd but give him hers;
I felt as tho' I'se sitting on a pint of chestnut burrs.

3.
I'll call dat darkey out, I will, and kill him very dead,
I hear the bullets running through his huckleberry head;
And if she loves another man, I'll go and squeeze her wiz'n;
And if she'll not be mine by gum, she never shall be hiz'n.
