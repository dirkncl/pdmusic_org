1.
The moon is us, the stars are out,
  The evening chimes are still;
And not a sound is heard without,
  But the distant Whippoorwill,
    But the distant Whippoorwill.
'Tis on such nights as this my love,
  When all is so serene
That fairies most delight to rove,
  And dance upon the green,
That fairies most delight to rove
  And dance upon the green,
    And dance upon the green.

2.
Once on a bank of roses laid,
  And where soft violets grew,
I saw the Queen of Fairies braid
  Her wreath of varied hue,
    Her wreath of varied hue.
Here had the Fays together met,
  To hold a grand levee;
They soon made up a Quadrille set,
  And frolick'd in wild glee:
They soon made up a Quadrille set,
  And frolick'd in wild glee,
    And flolick'd in wild glee.

3.
Then come, my love, let's to the grove,
  And sit beneath the tree;
And soon in every bough above,
  We'll hear the Fairies glee:
    We'll hear the Fairies glee:
The air with music too will seem,
  Fill'd from AEolian strings;
Then let's away to sleep and dream
  Beneath the fairies wings.
Then let's away to sleep and dream
  Beneath the fairies wings.
    Beneath the fairies wings.
