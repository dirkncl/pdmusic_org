1. Then be it so, and  let us part, 
Since love like mine has fail’d to move thee; 
But do not think this constant heart, 
Can ever cease, in grate to love thee 
No spite of all thy cold disdain 
I’ll bless the hour when first I met thee; 
And rather bear whole years of pain, 
And rather bear whole years of pain, 
then e’en for one short hour forget thee, 
Forget thee No. Forget thee! No. 
Forget thee! No, Forget thee! No.

2. Still mem’ry now my only friend,
Shall with her soothing art endeavour
My present anguish to suspend,
By painting pleasures lost for ever.
She shall the happy hour renew,
When full of hope and smiles I met thee,
And little thought the day to view,
[And little thought the day to view,]
When thou wouldst wish me to forget thee.

3. Yet I have liv’d to view that day,
To mourn my past destructive blindness;
To see now turn’d with scorn away,
Those eyes, once fill’d with answ’ring kindness.
But go— farewell, and be thou blest,
If thoughts of what I feel will let thee;
Yet though thy image kills my rest,
[Yet though thy image kills my rest,]
’Twere greater anquish to forget thee.
