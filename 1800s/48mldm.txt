1. Now darkies listen to me, 
A story I’ll relate, 
Which happen’d many years ago, 
In ole Virginnee state; 
My massa he buy Dinah, 
And bring her home to me, 
De lublies shinning creator, 
Dat ebber you did see.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Oh, Dinah Mae, 
My lubly Dinah Mae, 
How many tears I’ve shed for you, 
When de moonbeams nightly play.

2. How often wid my Dinah,
When de moon be on its way,
We’ve pledg’d our lubs togedder,
For ebber and a day;
And when I tink how happy,
Wid Dinah I have been,
Upon dat lubly flowing stream,
And on its banks so green.

3. One night I ax my Dinah,
If she wid me would go,
A sailing cross de ribber,
To see my farder, Joe;
When on de way so pleasant,
So happy, and so gay,
My Dinah she fell over board,
And on de bottom lay.

4. I jump’d into de ribber,
My Dinah to obtain,
She say, farewell I’m dying, Joe,—
She nebber speak again;
Wid hebby heart I dig de grave,
And softly laid her down.
I strew it o’er wid flow’rs sweet,
And dar I set and moan.

5. From dat day to de present,
My heart it sobs and beats.
And when dat day comes once a year,
I nebber nebber eats;
I takes my seat along side,
De grave where Dinah lay,
And softly do I whisper,
Come to me, Dinah Mae.
