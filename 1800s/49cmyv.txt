"Choose Me Your Valentine" (c.1849)
A Rondo
Sung by Mrs. Knight
With Accompaniments for the Piano Forte
Composed by Charles Edward Horn, 1786-1849

Choose me your Valentine
next let us marry
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry
Choose me your Valentine
next let us marry
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry

Promise and keep your vows
or vow ye never
Loves doctrine disallows
truth breaker's ever
Choose me your Valentine
next let us marry
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry
Choose me your Valentine
next let us marry
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry

You have broke promise twice
cruel unto me
If you prove faithless thrice
none then will woo you
If you prove faithless thrice
none then will woo you
Choose me your Valentine
next let us marry
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry
Choose me your Valentine
Valentine Valentine
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry
Choose me your Valentine
Valentine Valentine
Love to the death will pine
If we long tarry
If we long tarry
If we long tarry.
