1.
I had a rosebud in my garden growing,
A plant I cherished with a father's care,
When other darkies round that plant was hoeing,
Its zefferessence seemed to fill the air;
Oh, how I wanted that little plant while creeping,
She, like her mother, always light and gay.
One night I left her in her bed a-sleeping,
And in the morning she was stole away.

[REFRAIN]
One night I left her in her bed a-sleeping,
And in the morning she was stole away.

CHORUS A1
Dey stole, dey stole, dey stole dis child away,
Dey stole, dey stole, dey stole dis child away.

SOLO
Oh! hear me now calling, Oh! hear me I pray!
My heart, my heart is breaking for my child,
for my child dey stole away.
Oh! oh! oh! [CHORUS] hear dat voice!
[SOLO] Oh! oh! [CHORUS] hear dat voice!

CHORUS B, 2 times
I hear dar hoofs upon de hill,
I hear dem fainter, fainter still,
I hear dar hoofs upon de hill,
I hear dem fainter, fainter still.

CHORUS A2
Dey stole, dey stole, dey stole dis child away,
Dey stole, dey stole, dey stole dis child away,
my child away, my child away, my child away.

2.
Oh, then this heart was wither'd and dejected,
I wandered through the fields, but all in vain,
And ev'ry plant on me a shade reflected,
The tears they fell around me like the rain;
The sun above looked down upon my sorrow,
My heart was withered, I sought for her in vain.
My child was stole, was last to me forever,
I never saw that angel form again.

[REFRAIN]
My child was stole, was last to me forever,
I never saw that angel form again.

(CHORUS A1)
