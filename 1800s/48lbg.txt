1. Lets be gay and banish sorrow
All our work is done to day
Laugh and sing untill tomorrow
Tis the niggers holyday

Lets be gay and banish sorrow
  All our work is done today
Laugh sing untill tomorrow
  Tis then niggers holiday.

In the morning out we go
 To chop the wood and the corn to hoe
But when we return at night
 we dance with the galls till the broad day light.
Broad day light.

Lets be gay and banish sorrow
  All our work is done today
Laugh and sing untill tomorrow
  Tis the niggers holy day.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Lets be gay and banish sorrow
All our work is done today.
Laugh and sing until tomorrow
Laugh and sing,
Laugh and sing,
Laugh and sing until tomorrow,
Laugh and sing,
Laugh and sing,
Tis the niggers holy day.

2. Strike the Banjo, strike the gaily
  Bones and Tambourine now play
Fiddle use your bow more gaily
  Tis de niggers holy day.

Strike the Banjo, strike the gaily
  Bones and Tambourine now play
Fiddle use your bow more gaily
  Tis de niggers holy day.

To the merry band so gay
  We cast all sorrow and grief away.
But when we return at night
  we dance with the gals till the broad day light.
Broad day light.

Strike the Banjo, strike the gaily
  Bones and Tambourine now play
Fiddle use your bow more gaily
  Tis de niggers holy day.

3. No care have we for our hearts are light
  And we dance wid de Galls till the morning light
Lets be gay and banish sorrow
  All our work is done today

Laugh and sing untill tomorrow
  Tis the niggers holy day.
But when we return at night
  we dance with the galls till the broad day light.
Broad day light.

No care have we for our hearts are light
  And we dance wid de Galls till the morning light
Lets be gay and banish sorrow
  All our work is done today.
