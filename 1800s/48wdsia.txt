1. Away down South in Alabama 
’Twas dar I left my old Aunt Hannah 
She old Miss Squashkum she was dare, 
She wantted a lock of dis child’s hair. 
  Way down South in Alabama.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Way down South in Alabama. 
Ah Hoo.
Way down South in Alabama.

2. After we danced two reels,
De hollow of de foot make a hole in de ground.
I play’d on de bugle, bust de clarinet,
Knocked on de bones and den de swinett
  Way down south in Alabama. 

3. Morocco shoes and blue silk stocking,
Dance wid me Miss Polly Hopkins.
My wife’s dead and I’m a widder,
All de way from Roarin riber.
  Way down South in Alabama. 

4. Blow away ye gentle breezes
All among de Simmon tresses,
Dere I’ll set among de muses
Mendin all de old boots and shoeses
  Way down South in Alabama.
