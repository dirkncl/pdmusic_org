1. “Who shall die first,” whisper’d Hope to the Rose, 
Who shall sink earlier into the grave, 
I by my fleetness, or thou by thy sweetness 
Which of the two is the future to save? 
I by betraying or thou by decaying, 
Who shall sleep first in eternal repose? 
Soon shall we sever— or live we  for ever— 
Who shall die first whisper‘d Hope to the Rose; 
Who shall die first— whisper’d Hope to the Rose. 

2. I!— said the flower— tho’ sweet is my blooming, 
Soon will my loveliness wither and die— 
Lives that are sweetest are ever the fleetest,— 
Hours most happy, most rapidly fly; 
But Hope dieth never, it liveth for ever, 
Enchantment around the young bosom it throws— 
in smiling or weeping, Hope never is sleeping. 
I shall die first said the beautiful Rose; 
I shall die first said the beautiful Rose. 

3. The Rose was mistaken— its dwelling forsaken— 
Hope and its promises died in the heart— 
The love it desired had falsely expired, 
Fated in fruitlessness soon to depart!— 
The sweet scented flower still graces the bower, 
And there in its loveliness gracefully blows— 
Its beauties displaying, it lives undecaying, 
To tell the sad story of Hope and the Rose, 
To tell the sad story or Hope and the Rose.
