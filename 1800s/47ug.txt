1. As I was guan to Sandy point de uder arter noon, 
Dis niggers heel com’l out ob joint a runnin arter a coon; 
I thought I see’d him on a log, a lookin mighty quar. 
Wen I cum’d up to de log, de coon he was’nt dar. 

CHORUS [sung after verse]
O come along, O Sandy Boy, now come along O do; 
O what will Incle Gabriel say, 
ya oh oh oh ya oh oh oh 
What will Uncle Gabriel say, 
why Jinny cant you come along too.

2. I blow’d de horn, I call’d de dog, and tell him for to bark; 
I hunt all night in de hollow log, but de coon he still keep dark; 
At last I hear de old coon sneeze, de dog he fly around; 
And on to him he den did freeze, and pull him to de ground.

3. De coon he lay upon de ground, as stiff as any post;
I Knock him den upon de head, and he gabe up de ghost;
I took him to de old log house, as soon as he suspire;
He look’d just like a little mouse, and we roast him on de fire.

4. De niggers dey come all around, and kick up a debil of a splutter;
Dey eat de coon and clar de ground, to dance de chicken flutter,
Dey dance all night till de broke ob day, to a tune on de old banjo
And den dey all did gwan away, before de chicken crow.
