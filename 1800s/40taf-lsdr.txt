1. Float forth thou flag of the free!
Flash far over land and sea,
Proud ensign of liberty Hail Hail Hail to thee!
The blue of the Heav’ns is thine,

The stars on thy canvas shine.
Thy heraldry tells thee divine;
Hail Hail to thee.
Thy white proclaims thee unstain’d
Thy crimson thy love unfeign’d,
To man by des pots enchain’d.
Hail Hail to Thee Hail Hail to thee!


CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Float forth the flag of the Free
Flash far over land and sea
Till the world shout liberty!
Hail Hail Hail to thee!
Hail to thee
Hail to thee
Hail Hail to thee
Hail to thee!
Hail to thee
Hail Hail to thee thee!

2. Float forth thou flag of the free!
Flash far over land and sea
Proud ensign of liberty
Hail Haul Hail to thee!

Under thy God giv’n light
Our Fathers went forth to fight,
’Gainst sceptr’d wrong for the right;
Hail Hail to thee
Again thy stars light the way
We search in UNITED array.
The Hydra of theason to slay
Hail Hail to Thee Hail Hail to Thee!
