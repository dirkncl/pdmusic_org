1.
Sleeping, I dream'd love-- dream'd love, of thee;
O'er the bright waves, love, floating were we;
Light in thy fair hair play'd the soft wind,
Gently thy white arms round me were twined;
And as thy song love swell'd o'er the sea,
Fondly thy blue eyes beam'd love to me.

2.
Soft o'er the bright waves howled forth the gale,
Fiercely the lightning flash'd on our sail;
Far wide our frail deck drove o'er the sea,
Your eyes like diamonds beam'd love on me.
Oh! heart awaken! wreck'd on her shore,
Thou art forsaken! dream heart no more!
