PART FIRST
==========
Represents the May Queen, full of joyousness and hope in on
the Eve of May Day.

PART SECOND
============
New Year's Eve--declined in health, requesting her Mother
to call her to see the Sun rise upon the New Year--a sight
she never expects to enjoy again.

PART THIRD
===========
The return of Spring--still alive, when the first flowers
are cut--"The beautiful Blue Violets"--expecting to die,
with the assurance of a blessed Immortality--informing her
Mother and sister Effie, that she has been called to
Heaven by the Angels.

1. If you’re waking call me early, call me early, mother dear,
For I would see the sunrise upon the glad Newyear.
It is the last Newyear that I shall ever see,
Then you may lay me low i’ the mould and think no more of me.

2. Tonight I saw the sun set: he set and left behind
The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace of mind;
And the Newyear’s coming up, mother, but shall I never see
The blossom on the blackthorn, the leaf upon the tree.

3. There’s not a flower on all the hills: the frost is on the pane:
I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again:
I wish the snow would melt, and he sun come out on high:
I long to see a flower so before the day I die.

4. The building rook will caw from the windy, tall elm tree,
And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea,
And the swallow will come back again with summer o’er the wave,
But I shall lie alone, mother, within the mould’ring grave.

5. Upon the chancel casement and upon that grave of mine,
In the early early morning the summer sun’ll shine,
Before the red cock crows from the farm upon the hill,
When you are warm asleep, mother, and all the world is still.

6. When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning light,
You’ll never see me more in the long, gray fields at night;
When from the dry, dark wold the summer airs blow cool
On the oatgrass and the swordgrass, and the bulrush in the pool.

7. You.ll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn shade,
And you’ll come sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid.
I shall not forget you, mother, I shall hear you when you pass,
With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant grass.

8. I have been wild and wayward, but you’ll forgive me now;
You’ll kiss me, my own mother, upon my cheek and brow;
Nay, nay, you must not weep, nor let your grief be wild.
You should not fret for me, mother, you have another child.

9. If I can I’ll come again, mother, from out my restingplace;
Though you’ll not see me, mother, I shall look upon your face;
Though I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken what you say,
And be often, often with you when you think I’m far away.
