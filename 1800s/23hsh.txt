1.
'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble there's no place like home!
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere:
Home! Home! sweet, sweet, Home!
There's no place like Home!
There's no place like Home!

2.
An exile from Home, splendor dazzles in vain,
Oh! give me my lowly thatch'd cottage again!
The birds singing gaily that came at my call,
Give me them with peace of mind, dearer than all:
Home! Home! sweet, sweet, Home!
There's no place like Home!
There's no place like Home!

[additional verses published on 26 January 1830]
3.
How sweet 'tis to sit, 'neath a fond Father's smile,
And the cares of a Mother to soothe and bequile,
Let others delight mid new pleasures to roam,
But give me oh! give me the pleasures of Home.
Home! Home! sweet, sweet, Home!
But give me, oh! give me,
The pleasures of Home.

4.
To thee I'll return, over burden'd with care,
The heart's dearest solace will smile on me there,
No more from that Cottage, again will I roam,
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home;
Home! Home! sweet, sweet, Home!
There's no place like Home!
There's no place like Home!
