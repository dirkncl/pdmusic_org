1. Nigger put down that jug.
Touch not a single drop;
I'd gin it many a hug,
And dar you lef it stop;
'Twas dis ole nigger's hand
Dat fust did place it dar;
An dar you lef it stand
Or else dis nigger swar.

2. Dat ole famyliar jug,
Chock full ob nigger rum,
Lord how I lub to hug
Becase de drunk soon come;
Dar nigger lef it lay,
Touch not a single taste;--
Golly I cum dat way
Your back wid ropes I haste.

3. When but a nigger boy,
A hoeing massa's corn,
Lord how it gub me joy
To take from dat a horn;
I kiss it two tree time,
An den I suck him dry;
Dat jug he name but mine
So dar yu's lef him be.

4. My moufh around he cling
Close as de rum ole friend,
I kiss he an I sing
Dat rum may nebber end;
Nigger put down dat jug,
Touch not a single drop;
I'd gin it many a hug,
An dar you lef it stop.
