1. Ye seamen of Columbia,
Now claim your native sea,
Break off Britania’s galling chain,
And set the billows free,
The Spirit of your Country calls,
And points where Ocean rolls,
and points where Ocean rolls.
Ye shall reign o’er the main
while its angry surges roar.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Ye shall reign o’er the main,
Ye shall reign o’er the main.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Ye shall reign o’er the main,
While its angry surges roar,
’Till the sun sets ne’er to rise,
sets ne’er to rise again,
and the moon looks out no more.

2. ’Twas o’er the Ocean,
Our gallant fathers came;
Their spirits brav’d the raging blasts,
And made the billows tame;
Sail boldly in their shining wake,
Their fame your leading star,
Their fame your leading star.

3. True Yankee tars fear nothing,
Inur’d to war and storms;
They smile at images of death,
In all their ghastly forms;
Now playing with the spouting whale,
Now combating the foe,
Now combating the foe.
Ye shall reign o’er the main
while its angry surges roar.
