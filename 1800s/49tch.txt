1. How sweet the rest that labor yields
  The humble and the poor,
Where sits the patr'arch of the fields
  Before his cottage door!
The lark is singing in the sky,
  The swallow in the eaves,
And love is beaming in each eye,
  Beneath the summer leaves.

2. The air amid his fragrant bow'rs,
  Supplies unpurchas'd health,
And hearts are bounding 'mid the flow'rs,
  More dear to him than wealth!
Peace, like the blessed sunlight plays,
  Around his humble cot,
And happy nights and cheerful days,
  Divide his lowly cot.

3. And when the village sabbath bell,
  Rings out upon the gale,
The father bows his head to tell
  The music of its tale--
A fresher verdure seems to fill,
  The fair and dewy sod,
And ev'ry infant tongue is still,
  To hear the word of God.

4. Oh! happy hearts-- to him who stills
  The ravens when they cry,
And makes the lilly 'neath the hills,
  So glor'ous to the eye--
The trusting patriarch prays to bless,
  His labor with increase;
Such ways are "ways of pleasantness,"
  And all such paths are peace.
