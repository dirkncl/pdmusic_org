1. I have lov’d thee dearly lov’d thee, 
Through an age of worldly woe, 
How ungrateful I have prov’d thee, 
Let my mournful exile show, 
Ten long years of anxious sorrow 
Hour by hour I counted o’er 
Looking forward till tomorrow. 
Ev’ry day I lov’d thee more. 
Ev’ry day I lov’d thee more.

2. Pow’r nor splendor could not charm me.
I no joy in wealth could see.
Nor could threats or fears alarm me,
Save the fear of losing thee:
When the storms of fortune press’d thee
I have wept to see thee weep,
When relentless cares distress thee,
I have lull’d those cares to sleep.
I have lull’d those cares to sleep.
