1. Trim the Lamp and fill the bowl, 
Should we from this place depart, 
Here’s the spring that cheers the soul, 
And gives rapture to the heart, 
And gives rapture, gives rapture to the heart, 
Spirit of etherial birth, 
By the gods to man sent down, 
By the gods to man sent down, 
To wean the soul from dregs of earth, 
And in the cup our sorrows drown, 
To wean the soul from dregs of earth, 
And in the cup our sorrows drown, 
Our sorrows drown.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE] 
Trim the lamp and fill the bowl, 
Should we from this place depart, 
Here’s the spring that cheers the soul, 
And gives rapture, to the heart.
And gives rapture, gives rapture to the heart.
Gives rapture, rapture to the heart, 
gives rapture to the heart.

2. Vain are cares the hand of folly, 
Thrown into the cup of life, 
Wine cheers the soul of melancholly, 
Heals the rankling wound of strife, 
Heals the rankling the rankling wound of strife, 
As the cup of sorrow bright’ning, 
As the goblet passes round, 
As the goblet passes round, 
Beauty’s eye of magic light’ning, 
Beams to heal the lover’s wound.
Beauty’s eye of magic light’ning, 
Beams to heal the lover’s wound.
The lover’s wound.
