1. [Solo]
Columbia, favor'd land,
Long may thy banner wave,
O'er Freedom's birth place where,
She may find a grave.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Then Ho! the Sons of thrall!
Come ye at Freedom's call,
Where ye may sit beneath the shade
By your own vine and figtree made,
  Where ye may sit beneath the shade
  By your own vine and figtree made.

2. [Solo]
Here war hath quench'd his brand,
And Peace assum'd her sway,
Our hearts are warm'd beneath,
Her mild and genial ray.

3. [Solo]
No haughty Monarch's frown,
Or mitred Despot fear,
For here to Liberty,
And altar we have reard.

4. [Solo]
Her Standard still she grasps,
Where her bright star arose,
As light to quide her friends,
The stripes to show her foes.

5. [Solo]
Beneath our Eagle's wing,
She rest secure from harm,
And with an olive branch,
Our Enemies disarm.

6. [Solo]
Then rend your savage bonds
And to the land repair,
Where all who strive may win,
Wealth, Fame, and Honor there.
