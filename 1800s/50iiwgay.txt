[cover portrait of Jenny Lind]
"In Infancy When Gay and Young" (1850)

"A love of music came to her naturally and began to develop
itself in her when she was only three years old.  At that
wonderful early age, song was her ruling passion; she
could give voice with amazing accuracy in every melody
which struck her ear.  As she worked she sung, and even when
ill, she would attempt to seek in the effects of her clear
musical voice, relief from the pains of sickness."

1. In Infancy when gay and young,
Ev’ry day I blithely sung,
While I my busy needle plied,
Each passing hour in song did glide,
And happy did my moments fleee,
When singing native melody;

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
’Twas thus I chas’d time’s hours away,
Ever singing, ever gay.
In Infancy when gay and young,
Ev’ry day I blithely sung,
While I my busy needle plied,
Each passing hour in song did glide.

2. Tho’ suff’ring had subdued my frame,
My childish cong was heard the same,,
And Sweden’s lov’d and fav’rite strain,
Hath often sooth’d my hours of pain;
Tho’ rosy health had from me flown,
Song never made me feel alone.
