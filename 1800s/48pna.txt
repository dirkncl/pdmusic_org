1. 
Come all you gentle darkies, 
  A tale I’m gwine to tell, 
A bout a charming colored gal, 
  I lubed so song and well. 
Some pity show, good darkies, 
  I’ll tell you if I can, 
But, oh! it breaks my heart to speak 
  Oh my poor Nelly Ann.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Poor Nelly Ann! 
Poor Nelly Ann!  
Her form I see, 
She looks at me, 
Poor Nelly Ann!

2. 
I saw her in de springtime, 
  Her breff was like a rose; 
Her eye was bright, her step was light, 
  I see here– dere she goes! 
Oh! darkies, darkies, pity! 
  Her face seems pale and wan, 
I nebber, nebber can forget 
  My poor, poor Sally Ann!

3. 
One time we sat together, 
  To see de sun decline; 
Poor Nelly faintly speak, and say: 
  “In life and deff I’m thine.” 
Oh! worse den deff de parting, 
  To me, forsaken man! 
She pined– she died widin dese arms, 
  My poor, poor Nelly Ann!
