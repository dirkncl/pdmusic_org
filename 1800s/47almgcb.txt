1. The old hero stands on the brow of the hill,
With his heart in the thick of the fray,
Where his squadrons beneath him are bat’ling still,
On the eve of that terrible day;
His quick eye has numbered the mustering bands,
And he points to the enemy’s flag,
While the battery answers the old man’s commands,
“A little more grape, Captain Bragg.”

2. The foe man charge home with a thundering shock,
And a touch of Castillian pride;
They dash on our lines like a wave on the rock,
When the storm is abroad on the tide;
The wave falleth back but the rock standeth still—
There is heat in that bristling crag—
And the old man stands yet on the brow of the hill—
“A little more grape, Captain Bragg!”

3. Then spoke the loud cannon it thunders again,
Like spirits they scream on the air,
And the fallen are lying in swaths on the plain
Deaths busiest reapers are there—
But now is the song of those death reapers still,
Yet let not our battle song lag,
Hurrah! to the old man that stood on the hill
And “A little more grape, Captain Bragg!”
