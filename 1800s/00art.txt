1. A Rose tree in full bearing, 
Had sweet flowers fair to see, 
On Rose beyond comparing, 
For beauty attracted me. 
Tho’ eager once to win it, 
Lovely blooming trees and gay, 
I find a canker in it, 
And now throw it far away.

2. How fine this morning early, 
All was sunshine clear and bright, 
So late I lov’d you dearly, 
Tho’ lost now each fond delight. 
The clouds seem big with showers, 
Sunny beams no more are seen, 
Farewell ye happy hours, 
Your falsehood has chang’d the scene.
