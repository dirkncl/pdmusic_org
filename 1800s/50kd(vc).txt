1.
I'm deep in lub wid a color'd gal dat come from Tennesee,
  I don't no but I guess she lubs a color'd man like me;
De fust time dat I saw her she was walking on de green,
  A darkie dat was wid me says, "dare goes Miss Katy Dean."

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! Katy, oh! Katy,
  I bid you now farewell,
If ever we should meet again
  a story I will tell--
Oh! Katy, oh! Katy,
  I bid you now farewell,
If ever we should meet again
  a story I will tell.

2.
Her eyes beamed bright as gold dust and her teeth as white as snow,
  And when she raised her voice to sing 'twas sweeter than de crow,
And in her lemonadeing waltz dat lubly form was seen,
  My fascinating heart did burn for pretty Katy Dean.

3.
Miss Katy's in Virginia now as happy as can be,
  But bery soon she's coming back to lib in Tenesee,
And when she does come back again we'll go upon de green,
  And you will see a wedding wid Myself and Katy Dean.
