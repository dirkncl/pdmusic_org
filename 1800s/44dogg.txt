1. I am a nigger hard to beat,
Hot from de North Carlina
De prettist gal I eber saw,
Couln't come to tea wid Dinah,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! look dar!
Oh! look whar!!
Oh! look ober yonder,
Dont you see de old grey goose,
Smiling at de gander?

2. She was de prettist gal in town,
De niggers do admire her,
An ebery time dey see her strut,
It sets dar harts on fire.

3. I see her at a ball one night,
Oh! she look so lazy,
She wink for a lock of dis childs hair,
To set dis nigger crazy.

4. Se ball was ober I took my seat,
Clem Green he blow'd de bugle,
Dan Tucker he guv out de hymn,
Dey call it Yankee Doodle.

5. I thought dat I would bust my boots,
To see dem niggers cryin;
One ole wench roll'd up her eyes
Just like a calf a dying.

6. But coming to herself agin,
I gave to her my hand,
Her hair hung down her coal black cheeks,
Like sea weeds round a clam.
