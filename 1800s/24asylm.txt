1. And since you leave me 
And thus deceive me 
No scene can give me 
  Relief from pain 
My only loveer 
Has prov’d a rover. 
All joy is over 
  My tears are vain.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then go forever 
Yet though we sever 
Alas I never 
  Can wish you ill 
While life is dearest 
And joy is nearest 
Thou Felix dearest 
  I love thee still.

2. Caress’d, caressing,
My joy, my blessing,
Thy love possesing.
  I thought thee true;
The vision lasted,
But scarcely tasted,
When all was blasted,
  False youth by you.


3. When joy abounded,
My harp I sounded,
Each not resounded,
  My love to shew;
But now the measure,
That spoke of pleasure,
Has only leasure,
  For notes of woe.
