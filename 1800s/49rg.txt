1. I’se acquainted wid a yaller gal, 
Born in Saint Domingo. 
Was not she a hansum gal? 
Dat she was by jingo; 
But most ob all dat pleas’d me best, 
She was a charming singer, 
And play’d de Banjo while she sung, 
Her name was Rosa Ginger.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Twang, twang, de banjo rang, 
So nimble was her finger, 
Lubly was de song she sung, 
My hansum Rosa Ginger.

2. Miss Rosa she was quite de ting,
But rather too romantic;
She us’d to serenade de youths,
On tudder side de atlantic;
A darkey youth cotch’d by her wiles,
Whose passions would not linger,
Reserv’d at once to win her smiles;
And change her name from Ginger.

3. Dis youth he was by lub inflam’d,
His proper name JoHones;
She always play’d de ole banjo,
While Jones he play’d BoHones;
He often sigh’d, he often tri’d,
To marry, he to bring her;
But she held off and linger’d long,
For frickle was Miss Ginger.

4. One night dar was a cullard ball,
Which rarely happen’d so so;
Wid pleasure I did meet her dar,
For I took wid me de banjo;
I sung wid her you may be sure,
I wish’d dat I would bring her;
She sigh’d and sung, while her head it hung,
I tink I had won Miss Ginger.

5. Now dis took place some years ago,
Yet she and I am single;
Den ladies all just hab a care,
Or tears wid joy will mingle;
She jilted me, O, she jilted me,
For dat she seems to linger;
Although she plays de ole banjo,
She still am ole Miss Ginger.
