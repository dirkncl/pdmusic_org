1. “The Star of Empire” poets say, 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
“Forever takes its onward way!” 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
That this be proven in our land, 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
It seems Jehovah’s great command, 
  Ho! Westward Ho!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ho! Westward! 
Soon the world shall know 
That all is grand 
In the western land; 
Ho! Westward Ho!

2. Our Pilgrim Fathers sang the song,— 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
Hear Right should triumph over Wrong? 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
Still— westward many thousands flock, 
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
And sing the shout from Plymough Rock, 
  Ho! Westward Ho!

3. Tis ever thus, the people cry,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
And from the eastern citites fly,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
To live on God’s most glorious land,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
Where hearts and thoughts are ever grand!
  Ho! Westward Ho!

4. The western fields, give thousands wealth,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
And yield to all a glowing health,
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
For all inclined to honest  toil,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
Secure their fortunes from the soil,
  Ho! Westward Ho!

5. We hear a thousand men relate,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
They wandered to some westest State,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
Without a hope their lives to save,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
The climate snatched them from the grave;
  Ho! Westward Ho!

6. We love the glorious western land,
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
For here the peoples’ hearts expand,
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
And on the prairies broad and grand,
  Ho! Westward Ho! 
We all can see Jehovah’s hand,
  Ho! Westward Ho!
