1. I would I were the slight fern growing, 
Beneath my Highland Mary’s tread.
I would I were the green tree throwing, 
Its shadow o’er her gentle head!
I would I were a wild flower springing 
where my sweet Mary loves to rest, 
That she might pluck me while she’s singing, 
And place me on her snowy breast.

That she might pluck me while she’s singing, 
And place me on her snowy breast!
her snowy breast, 
and place me on her snowy breast.

2.
I would I were in yonder hea’ven,
A silver star, whose soft dim light;
Would rise to bless each summer even,
And watch my Mary all the night!
I would, beneath those small white fingers,
I were the lute her breath has fanned;
The gentle lute, whose soft note lingers,
As loath to leave her fairy hand.

The gentle lute, whose soft note lingers,
As loath to leave her fairy hand.
her fairy hand,
As loath to leave her fairy hand.

3.
Ah happy things!
Ye may not wander,
From Scotland to some darker sky,
But ever live unchanging yonder;
To happiness and Mary sigh!
While I at midnight sadly weeping,
Upon the deep transparent blue;
Can only gaze while all are sleeping,
And dream my Mary watches too.

Can only gaze while all are sleeping,
And dream my Mary watches too.
watches too,
And dream my Mary watches too.
