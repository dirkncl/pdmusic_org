1. ’Twas down in sunny south where my Linda used to dwell, 
Whar de sugar cane it grow, I know de spot full well. 
’Twas by de river’s noisy brook whar de sparkling waters glide, 
My Linda spoke de charming words dat she would be my bride.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Then gently strike the Tambourine, de Bones now lightly play, 
No more we’ll hear her cheerful voice for Linda’s pass’d away.

2. When o’er the fields I came with slow and wearied pace,
My drooping spirits could be cheer’d by Linda’s smiling face;
With tender words she’d soothe my heart and drive all care away,
Then we’d together happy sit ’till night had turned to day.

3. But now those days are over, her form no more I.ll see,
For Linda’s pass’d away from earth, no joy is left for me;
My heart with sorrow now is fill’d, my tears I cannot stay,
All hope and comfort now is gone for Linda’s pass’d away.
