1. Meet me by moonlight alone
  And then, I will tell you a tale
Must be told by the moonlight alone.
  In the grove at the end of the vale
You must propose to come for I said
  I would shew the nightflowers their Queen
Nay turn not away thy sweet head
’Tis the lovli est ever was seen.
[REFRAIN]
Oh! meet me by moonlight alone,
  Meet me by moonlight alone.

2. Daylight may do for the gay,
  The thoughtless, the heartless, the free
But there’s something about the moon’s sky,
  That is sweeter to you and to me,
Oh! remember be sure to be there
  For tho’ dearly a moonlight I prize
I care not for all in the air
  If I want the sweet light of your eyes
[REFRAIN]
So meet me by moonlight alone,
  Meet me by moonlight alone.
