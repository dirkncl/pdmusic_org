1.
The frozen Streets in Moonshine glitter,
the midnight hour has long been past,
ab' me the wind blows keen and bitter,
I fink beneath the piercing blast,
in every Vein seems life to languish,
their weight my limbs no more can bear
but no one soothes the Orphan's anquish,
an no one heeds the Orphan's pray'r.

2.
Hark hark for surely footsteps near me
advancing prefs, the drifted Snow,
I die for food! ah Stranger hear me
I die for food some alms bestow,
you feel not guilty wretch implore you
so wanton pleads in feign'd despair
a famish'd Orphan kneels before you
oh grant a [--] Orphan's pray'r.

3.
Perhaps you  think my lips dissembling,
of virtuous sorrows feign a tale,
then mark my frame with anguish trembling,
my hollow eyes and features pale,
E'n should my story prove I deal
too well their wasted limbs declare,
my wants at least are not unreal
then Stranger grant the Orphan's pray'r.

4.
He's gone! no mercy man will show me
in prayers no more I'll wafte my breath
here on the frozen Earth I'll throw me
and waint in mute despair for death
farewell, thou cruel world tomorrow
no more thy scorn my heart will fear
the grave will shield the Child of sorrow
and Heaven will hear the Orphan's pray'r.

5.
But thou proud Man, the Beggar scorning
unmov'd who saw'st me kneel for bread,
thy heart shall ache to bear at morning
that morning sound the Beggar dead,
and when the room resounds with laughter
my famish'd cry thy mirth shall scare
and often shalt thou wish here after
thou had welcom'd the Orphan's pray'r.
