1. I stood where a storm on the mountain was raging. 
The stars were all hidden from sight, 
The clouds in wild battle were darkly engaging 
And threaten’d perpetual night; 
I laugh’d at the threat for I knew ’twas but seeming. 
The winds blew the vapours away. 
And the stars in a union of glory were gleaming, 
A bright and immortal array.

2. The land of our father’s, thy stars shall forever,
Resemble that Union on high;
No strife can extinguish, no menace dissever
The lights of Columbia’s sky;
From ocean to ocean, thine eyes shall tower,
O’er all land undivided and free;
And his eye shall delight in the evergreen bower,
That springs from the liberty tree.

3. Like the stern rocky chain of some fair tropic Island,
The hearts of thy children shall stand;
And the billows advancing to mine the gay highland,
In bubbles shall break on the strand;
With the rolling of years, thou shalt lose every error,
Still farther thy banner shall flame;
Till tyranny crownless and pallid with terror,
Shall burn in the blaze of thy fame.
