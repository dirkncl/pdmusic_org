1. To weary hearts, to mourning homes
God’s meekest Angel gently comes.
No power has he to bannish pain
Or give us back our lost again.
And yet in tenderest love and dear
Our Heavenly Father sends him here.

2. There’s quiet in that Angel’s glance.
There’s rest in his still contenance.
He mocks no grief with idle cheer
Nor wounds with words the mourner’s ear;
But ills and woes he may not cure.
He kindly learns us to endure.

3. Angel of Patience sent to calm
Our feverish brows with cooling balm
To lay the storms of hope and fear
And reconcile life’s smile and tear,
The throbs of wounded pride to still
And make our own our Father’s will.

4. Oh thou who mournest on the way
With longings for the close of day.
He walks with thee, that Angel kind
And gently whispers be resigned.
Bear up, bear on the end shall tell
The dear Lord ordereth all things well.
