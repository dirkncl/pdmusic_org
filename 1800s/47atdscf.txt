1. De mornin sun has wink’d his eye 
An lit de face ob de bright blue sky, 
Den darkies up like crows an fly

Away! Away! Away! Away!

Away! Away! Away! Away!

2. Come quickly buss your gals an wives,
Whet up de Jawbone ob your knives,
Old Sambo’s whip sings as he drives
Away to de sugar cane field.

Away away away away
Away to de sugar cane field. 
Away away away away
Away to de sugar cane field.

3. Be quick, for de stalks am turnen brown,
And de luscious juice am sweaten down,
An spillen its sweets upon de groun’.
Den away to de sugar can field..

Away away away away,
Den away to de sugar can field.
Away away away away,

4.  Dar Juba, dont hang dat lip,
For if my blade should happen to slip,
A pound or two I might chance to clip,
Upon de sugar cane field.

5. Oh! when de sun gets half way round,
We’ll roll like black snakes on de ground,
An sweeten our rest by chewin a pound
Ob de stalk ob de sugar cane field.

Ob mortals, for we hab de power
To keep de airth from gowen sour,

Or de gals for walken candies too,
If we darkies wasn’t to cut an stew

Behind de door to take a sip
Ob de cream upon dar upper lip,

De juice, de juice, de juice, de juice, 
De juice ob de sugar can field.

9. Den cut away boys, we’ll soon retreat
To dinner whar de gals we’ll meet,
An taste dar lips dat am more sweet,
Dan de stalk ob de sugar cane field.

If you’d make de sugar stalks grow high,
Just carry us out an luff us lie
Upon de sugar cane field.

Upon, upon, upon, upon, 
Upon de sugar can field.
Upon, upon, upon, upon, 
Upon de sugar can field.
