[CHORUS sung before each verse (and after last verse)]
Life let us cherish while yet the taper glows 
And the fresh flowret pluck ere it close.

1. Why are we fond of toil and care, 
Why choose the rankling thorn to wear 
And heedless by the Lilly stray 
Which blossoms in our way.

2. When clouds obscure the atmosphere 
And forked lightnings rend the air, 
The Sun resumes his silver crest 
And suller adorn the west.

3. The genial seasons soon are o’er 
Then let us ere we quit this shore 
Contentment seek it is life’s zest 
The sunshine of the breast.

4. Away with every toil and care 
And cease the rankling thorn to wear 
With manful hearts life’s conflict meet 
Till Death sounds the retreat.
