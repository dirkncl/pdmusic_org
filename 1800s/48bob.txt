1. I’ve been through Carolina, 
I’ve been to Tennessee, 
I sailed the Mississippi, 
For massa set me free, 
I’ve kissed de lubly Creole 
On Lousiana’s shore, 
But I nebber found de gal so much 
De blooming Belle ob Baltimore. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, boys, Belle’s a beauty, 
Eyes so bright and cheek so sooty, 
No gal I eber seen afore, 
So sweet as Belle ob Baltimore.

2. My Belle is tall and slender,
And sings so berry clear,
You’d tink she was an owlingale,
If once her woice you hear;
I walked down to her cabin
And rapped upon the door,
I went to gub my doggertype
To my sweet Belle ob Baltimore.

3. I found her by de ribber,
My errand I did tell,
Says she “You gay deceiber,
I know your tricks too well;
I seen you kiss anudder gal,
De berry night afore!”
Wid dat she turned upon her heel
And off went Belle ob Baltimore.

4. I wrote my lub a letter,
And scented it so sweet,
De musk, de clobes, and peppermint,
Stuck out about a feet!
But all my trouble was no use,
I nebber seen her more,
For I squashed de tender Yechshins ob
My blooming Belle ob Baltimore.
