1. Maid of Athens! ere we part,
Give, oh! give me back my heart;
Or, since that has left my breast,
Keep it now and take the rest;
Hear me vow, before I go,
Zoë mon, Zoë mon, sas agapo.

2. By those tresses unconfined,
Woo’d by each aegean wind;
By those lids whose jetty fringe,
Kiss thy soft cheek’s blooming tinge;
By those wild eyes like the Roe.—
Zoë mon, Zoë mon, sas agapo.

3. By that lip I long to taste,
By that zoneincircled waist;
By all the tokenflowers that  tell,
What words can never speak so well;
By love’s alternate joy and woe—
Zoë mon, Zoë mon, sas agapo.

4. Maid of Athens! I am gone,
Think of me sweet! when alone;
Though I fly to Islambol,*
Athens holds my heart and soul!
Can I cease to love thee? no!—
Zoë mon, Zoë mon, sas agapo.
