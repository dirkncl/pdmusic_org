1. I have wander’d over mountain, 
I have wander’d over plain, 
And I come upon more gladness, 
To my happy home again 
I see once more the village church, 
Where oh my feet would stray. 
Ye list that sweet and merry children, 
close of summer’s day. 
Those sounds which charm’d my early days, 
I never could forget; 
And oh I’ve dream’d when far away, 
I heard their music yet. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
I have wander’d over mountain, 
I have wander’d over plain, 
And I come once more with gladness, 
To my happy home again, 
To my happy home again.

2. I think of all those happy days
Pass’d in my early home,
When not a cloud came o’er my brow,
Or thought of time to come;
I think of all my youthful sports,
My playmates gay and free.
Methinks I hear their joyous laugh
Beneath the old oak tree;
And now once more I see the halls
Of childhood’s happy home;
Now, like the dove, an ark I’ve found,
My steps no more shall roam.
