1.
Believe me if all those endearing young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly today,
Where to change tomorrow  and fleet in my arms
Like fairy gifts fading away!
Then would'st still be ador'd as this moment thou art,
Let thy loveliness fade as it will;
And around the dear ruin, each wish of my heart,
Would entwine itself verdantly still.

2.
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,
And thy cheek unprofaned by a tear,
That the fervour and faith of a soul can be known
To which time will but maike thee more dear!
Oh! the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets,
But as truly loves on to the close,
As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets,
The same look which she turn'd when he rose!
