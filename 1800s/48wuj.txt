1. Come white folks listen to my song Come listen to my ditty;
I’ll tell you ob a colour’d chap Born in de Iron city.
He us’d to run de Railroad, He was de Bulgine tender;
Of golly he’s de debil, When he gets upon a bender.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Den wake up Jake! Wake up Jake!
Wake up Jake, de fire wants pokin’
Steam am up and de Bulgine’s smokin!

2. Oh Jake has been to college, and he says he am a Poet,
An while de track am good an strong, he says he means to go it
Dat “Milton” went to “paradise,” and Byron he was witty,
But Jake he means to ’mortalize, dat same ole Iron City.

3. Oh Bonnyparte was de chap, dat went to Santalena,
And Billy Brutus was de man, dat ’sassinated Ceasa,
And Cromwell was de Oliver, dat gub it to em pritty,
And Billy Pit he was de man, dat nam’d the Iron City.

4. Oh! Jake he went to Mexico, and dar saw SantaAnna—
He took a message to de camp, ’twas Zachey dont surrender;
Says Santa whar do you come from, you seems to be quite witty
Says Jake, yuhyah! I’m one of de b’hoys, dat come from de Iron City.
