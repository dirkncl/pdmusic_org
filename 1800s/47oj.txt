1. A men down south I once did know; 
His head it was  so white as snow; 
I wesnt down to de Ball one night, 
De fust Gal he saw she was clear out ob sight. 

CHORUS 1, 2 and 3 
Ole Joe, ole Joe, a kicking up a hind and a foe, 
And a Yellow Gal a kicking up a hind old Joe, 
Ole Joe a kicking up a hind and a foe; 
And a Yellow Gal a kicking up a hind old Joe.

2. To a man at de door he den did say, 
O who’s dat co lor’d Gal I pray; 
Oh de Ball dis night she is Venus. 
Dey call her Rosa Clementnus.

3. Old Joe he walk wid her aside, 
And said old Gal will you be my bride; 
She says dear Joe I must confess, 
I realy lubs you much de best.

4. Dey married but ’tis sad to say, 
Dat ole Joe’s wife went dead one day; 
Dis gib ole nigger Joe de blue, 
He turn’d around and went dead too. 

CHORUS 4
Ole Joe, Joe’s done kicking up a bind and a foe,  
For Death stopp’d de kicking up ob poor old Joe. 
Joe’s done a kicking up a hind and a foe, 
For Death stopp’d de kicking up ob poor ole Joe.
