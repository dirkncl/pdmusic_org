1. Oft in the stilly night, 
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me, 
Fond mem’ry brings the light 
Of other days a round me! 
The smiles, the tears, of childhood’s years,
 The words of love then spoken, 
The eyes, that shone, now dimm’d and gone; 
 The cheerful hearts now broken! 

[Refrain sung after each verse]
Thus in the stilly night, 
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me, 
Sad mem’ry brings the light, 
Of other days around me.

2. When I remember all
The friends, so link’d together,
I’ve seen around me fall,
Like leaves in wintry weather;
I feel like one, who treads alone
 Some banquet hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled, whose garland’s dead,
 And all, but he, departed.
