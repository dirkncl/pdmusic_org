1.
When I lived in Louisiana not many hours ago,
I fell in lub wid a charming gal, her name was Jane Monroe;
Her eyes were bright as diamonds, her teeth were white as snow,
De prettiest gal I ever saw was charming Jane Monroe.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
But now she is far far away,
And I hear from her ebery day,
But if she was here,
She'd have nothing to fear,
For the darkies all love her so gay.

2.
My love was like a model from her heal down to her toe,
And sprightly as de hoppergrass was charming Jane Monroe;
I'd rather be a slave for life and have de corn to hoe,
Than to be free, and live without my charming Jane Monroe.

3.
The darkie traders come one day and buy my gal from me,
And left me all alone to mourn beneath the cypress tree,
It fill'd my heart wid grief and pain to think she had to go,
Still I live in hopes to meet again my charming Jane Monroe.
