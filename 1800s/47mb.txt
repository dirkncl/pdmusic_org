1.
I once did know a pretty gal,
  And took her for my wife,
She came from Louisiana,
  And I lik'd her as my life,

We happy lib'd togethder,
  She nebber caused me pain,
But on one dark and dreary night,
  I lost poor Mary Blane,

CHORUS [after each verse]
Oh, Farewell, farewell, poor Mary Blane,
one faithful heart will think of you,
Farewell, farewell, poor Mary Blane,
if we ne'er meet again.

2.
While in de woods I go at night,
  A hunting for some game,
A nigger came to my old hut,
  And stole my Mary Blane,

Long times gwan by it grieb'd me much,
  To tink no tidings came,
I hunt de woods both night and day,
  To find poor Mary Blane.

3.
I often asked for Mary Blane,
  My Massa he did scold,
And said you saucy nigger boy,
  If you must know, she's sold,

If dats de case she cannot live
  Through out a weary life,
Oh let me die, and lay me by
  My poor heartbroken Blane.
