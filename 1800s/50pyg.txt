1. Now white folks listen to my song, 
And hark unto me ditty, 
I’ll tell you of de yaller gals 
Of Philadelphia City. 
They are such pretty yaller gals, 
No odders can compete; 
And when you kiss dere lubly lips, 
Ha, ha! dey taste so sweet!

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
De Philadelphia yaller gals, 
De do take my fancy; 
Among dem all, dat I did see, 
Give me de one call’d Nancy.

2. They are tall and slender round de waist,
An berry much genteel;
Wid long silk hair and much more grace
Den all your Lucy Neals!
An when you see dem in de street,
Dey look so neat and plain,
You’d gib up de Belle of Baltimore,
And say dat she is slain.

3. I seen her at a ball one night,
Along wid Master Fay;
It was den I popp’d de question,
And dis to her did say:
“My Nancy, will you marry me,
And be my lubly wife?”
“Ah! yes, indeed,” said she, “Johnson,
And lib wid you for life.”
