1. Go tell him from this hour we part,
And own no mutual shrine;
I will not brook anothers heart
Should share the joys of mine.
I care not for his troubled sleep
Yet whisper to his ear,
My eye is not too proud to weep,
But frozen is the tear.

2. My step is light— my smile is gay,
  Nor yet my eye is dim—
Go tell him how in halls I stray
  And never think of him;
And how at eve, when music’s tone,
  Comes gushing o’er the air,
I feel not in my bower, alone,
  Nor miss his presence there.

3. I do not love— I do not hate—
  It were an idle thing!
In puling strain I will not prate,
  Nor yet the gauntlet fling;
But tell him like some passing gleam
  That flits along the lea,
And like a shadow on a stream,
  His memory is to me.

4. And tell him tho’ his every look
  Cold distance shuns to see:
Tho’ like a falsely labell’d book,
  His name is now to me;
And tho’ no more like music bland,
  His voice may haunt my rest:
I wear his jewel on my hand,
  His image on my breast.
