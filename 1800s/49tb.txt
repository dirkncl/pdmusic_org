1. She’s thine for ever now thine own,
My beautiful! my best,
I give her freely, yet I feel
Deep sorrow at my breast,
She’s thine, thine own, oh! let her be
Beloved as she has been by me.
She’s thine, thine own, oh! let her be
Beloved as she has been to me.
From Infancy her life hath seemed
The very life of mine,
The priceless treasure of my soul:
The Altar maketh thine!
Yes thine, thine own! then let her be
Beloved as she has been by me,
Yes thine, thine own, then let her be
Beloved as she has been by me.

2. The friends that prized; the hearts that loved,
The home where ne’er denied,
Was aught that innocence might ask;
She leaves, to be thy Bride,
Think, think of this, and let her be,
Beloved as she has been by me.
Think! think of this and let her be,
Beloved as she has been by me.
Be thine the husband’s holy care
To check each rising tear,
Her ev’ry woe with kindness share,
With love each sorrow cheer,
Then, then, indeed my child will be
Beloved as she has been by me,
Then, then, indeed my child will be
Beloved as she has been by me.
