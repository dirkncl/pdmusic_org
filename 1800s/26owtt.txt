NOTE: due to the lo-res of the source, 
several words were not clear, 
and "best guesses" were made.

1.
Do ye like my dear, lassie,
  The hills wild and free,
When he sang o’ the shepherd, 
  Was a song wi’ glee;
Or the steep rocky glen,
  Where the wild falcon hide–
Then on wi’ the tartan
  And now let us ride.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
On wi’ the tartan,
  On wi’ the tartan,
On wi’ the tartan,
  And now let us ride.

2. 
Do ye like the knave, lassie,
  As weel as the riggs?
Or the bonnie lone hours,
  Whar the sweet Robin diggs?
Or the sang o’ the lassie
  When wooing his bride–
Then on wi’ the tartan
  And now let us ride.

3. 
Do ye like the burn, lassie,
  That loops among Byrds?
Or the bonnie green balms,
  Whar it cannily rins?
Wi’ a candy his bonnie,
  Sae snug by his side–
Then on wi’ the tartan
  And now let us ride.
