1.
Why fair Maid in ev'ry feature,
  are such Signs of fear expres'd?
Can a wand'ring wretch-ed Creature
  with such terror fill thy breast
Do my [brazened?] looks alarm thee
  [????] vain,
not for kingdoms would I harm thee,
  alarm not then poor CRAZY JANE

[REFRAIN]
poor CRAZY JANE, poor CRAZY JANE,
not for kingdoms would I harm thee,
shun not then poor CRAZY JANE.

2.
Doest thou need to see my anguish!
  Mark me and avoid my woe!
When men [taller?] sigh and languish,
  Think them false, I found them joy
For I lov'd, [qf?] so sincerely
  How could ever love again,
Met the youth I lov'd so dearly
  Stole the wile of CRAZY JANE.

{REFRAIN)

3.
Foundly my young heart received him,
  Which was doom'd to love but one,
He sigh'd, he vow'd and I believ'd him,
  He was false to [?]
From that hour has Reason never
  Held her Empire o're my brain,
HENRY fled -- with him for ever
  Fled the wile of CRAZY JANE.

(REFRAIN)

4.
Now forlorn, and broken hearted,
  And with [hreazined?] thoughts begat,
On that spot where lost parted,
  On that spot where we first met
Still I sing my love lorn ditty,
  Still I slowly pass the plain,
Whilst each [pafser?] by in pity,
  Cries, God help thee CRAZY JANE.

(REFRAIN)
