1.
As streams at morn from seas that glide,
Rejoicing on their sparkling way,
Will turn again at eventide
To mingle with their native spray;
E'en so the currents of the soul,
Dear, sister, where so 'er we rove,
Will backward to our kindred roll,
The boundless ocean of our love.
  Will backward to our kindred roll,
  The boundless ocean of our love.

2.
Yon northern star, now burning bright,
The tource by which the wave-toss'd steer,
Burns not with more unwav'ring light
Than does thy love, my sister dear.
From stars above the streams below
Receive the glory they impart,
So, sister, do thy virtues glow
Within the mirror of my heart.
  So, sister, do thy virtues glow
  Within the mirror of my heart.
