1.
On a high in de fall ob de year,
A hungry coon would rove for a corn field dat was near.
Green com de coon dat lub!
De coon felt his appetite,
Ha! Ha! ses he, I mean to eat me fill did night,
All in dat corn field green.

2.
De night it was bery dark,
De sun hab set too soon;
He couldnt hear de bull frog bark,
Good wedder sex de coon;
He husk de corn upon de sail,
His appetite was keen,
On dis same night he wag'd his tail,
All in dat cornfield green.

3.
Enough I've eat de coon he cried,
Enough I've eat cried he;
He kick'd de bucker an died;
All by a holler tree;
De odder coons out ob spite,
De nebber would be seen;
To eat dey're fill at night,
All in dat cornfield green.
