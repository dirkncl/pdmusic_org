1.When first a babe upon the knee
My mother us’d to sing to me.
I caught the accents from her tongue
And e’er I talk’d I lisp’d in song

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
I’m little Bess the Ballad singer
I’m little Bess
I’m little Bess
I’m little Bess the Ballad singer.

2. In ev’ry Village where I come,
They call’s me by my infant name;
And pensive as I roam along,
This stills the burden of my song.

3. Thro’ wood and Village scenes I stray,
With plaintive suit and artle, and lay;
And ev’ry passenger I meet,
With lowly curt’sy thus I greet.
