1.
Gaily in the woody cove the old conk shell did swell
As de coal black coon escaped his foe down by the haunted well,
  down by the haunted well
The [missing page?]
heels and head and come butt against a pump.
All round he sought the coal black coon dat made him lose the boys so soon,
Except himself no other swell was by the lonely haunted well,
  by the lonely haunted well.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Hab a care-- don't go dar-- for the dark maid watches near,
for the dark maid all can hear
(hab a car) (hab a care) (don't go dar)
for the dark maid watches near.

2.
The pale white catnip growing dar its fragments round did swell,
As the darkey lay all night down by the haunted well,
A girl was dar she stood on air her features were so mild,
She took a horn and blow'd dese words eh eh darkey you're de child.
  My ebony rose my darkey pride,
  Come lib wid me and be my bride,
  Nor like a pump digrace yourself,
  By standing in dat haunted well.

3.
Down in de water she did stoop for a ring-- oh what a sell,
Oh his finger den she placed de hoop and dey both slid down the well,
Twas on dat dey the coon did stray twas then poor sambo fell,
When darkeys near they often hear a voice cry out all's well.
  At midnight then dar forms are seen,
  Propelling on a coon around de green,
  Voices am heard and conk shells swell,
  Around that lonely haunted well.
