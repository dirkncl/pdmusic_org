1. You must call me when de Bantam crows,
  Be sure you don't forget;
Tomorrow'll be de happiest day,
  Dat eber I lib'd yet,
For Chloe vows she will be mine,
  So long as she hab life,
So call me when de Bantam crows,
  And Chloe shall be my wife.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So rouse me when de Bantam crows,
And Chloe shall be my wife.

2. I'm sure I shall not sleep a wink
  For tinking ob de morn,--
I nebber felt so cotton before,
  Since de night when I was born;
So I will rise at brake ob day--
  I will, upon my life,
And make of flow'rs a garland gay,
  For Chloe's to be my wife.

3. And Nelly she shall go wid us,
  And so shall Dinah Blue,
And all the darkie friends I know,
  And all dere sweethearts too;--
And Joe shall bring his banjo dere,
  And Jim shall bring his fife,
And I will gib you all tings nice,
  When Chloe is made my wife.

4. Oh! how poor Sam will tear his hair
  When dey tell him Chloe is mine;
But he'd better not cast his eyes, I swear,
  Oh Chloe, my Venus divine!
But if I can nebber go to sleep,
  Why I can nebber awake,--
So call me when de Bantam crows,
  Than Chloe my wife I'll make.
