1.
My tent is 'mid the golden broom, is 'mid the golden broom
Where fairy bells and daisies bloom, and daisies bloom
Where fairy bells and daisies bloom,
Where the gay lark springs from the tall green rye
To her hall of light in the clear blue sky
The gay lark springs to her hall of light
in the sky the clear blue sky
I envy not in leafy bow'r
The proudest dame in banner'd tow'r
For the sorrows of life yet have cast no shade
O'er the merry young heart of the Gypsy maid.

2.
My cheek its many lustre owes, its lustre owes
To mature's hand which tints the rose, which tints the rose
To nature's hand which tints the rose.
While the songs I sing are wild and free
As the happy birds in the forest trees
The songs I sing are wild and free
As the birds in the forest tree.
I maidens tell, what stars unfold,
Of lovers sighs! of rings of gold;
And the secret love whispers is ne'er betray'd
By the merry young heart of the Gypsy maid.

Then list to me for sweet the spell,
The Gypsy knows to weave so well
Ah!

When moonbeams play on the silver lake
And her joyous tones the echoes wake.
