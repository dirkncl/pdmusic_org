1.
Faintly as tolls the ev'ning chime,
Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time,
  Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time:
Soon as the woods on shore look dim
We'll sing at St. Ann's our parting hymn;
Row brothers row the stream runs fast,
The rapids are near and the daylight's past,
  The rapids are near and the daylight's past.

2.
Why should we yet our sail unfurl,
There is [? ?] truth the blue wave to curl;
  This is [? ?] truth the blue wave to curl;
But when the wind blows off the shore,
Oh! sweetly will rest our weary oar;
Row brothers row the stream runs fast,
The rapids are near and the daylight's past,
  The rapids are near and the daylight's past.

3.
[Ulawes?] hide this trembling moon,
Shall see us float o'er the surges soon;
  Shall see us float o'er the surges soon;
Saint of this green isle, hear our prayers,
Oh! grant us cool heaven's and favoring airs;
Blow breezes blow, the stream runs fast,
The rapids are near and the daylight's past,
  The rapids are near and the daylight's past.
