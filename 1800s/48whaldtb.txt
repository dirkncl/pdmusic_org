1. Oh listen to the good old tune, 
And then I’ll sing anodder, 
Oh Massa gwan this afternoon, 
To call upon his brudder, 
So darkies wait alittle while, 
Till he gets out of sight. 
We’ll drop de shovel and de hoe, 
And have a little dance tonight. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
We’ll have a little dance tonight boys, 
tonight boys, tonight boys, 
We’ll have a little dance tonight boys, 
And dance by the light of the moon.

2. I wants de kincebrie handkerchief,
I wants de beaver hat,
Oh hand me down de high heel boots,
Likewise de silk cravat.
The darkies all are grinning,
Their teeth look berry white,
Case dere gwoan ober de mountain,
To have a dance tonight.

3. I rises at the brake of day,
To take my morning walk.
I meets my lovely Julian,
And dis is the way we talk.
I says you are my only lub.
You are my heart’s delight.
Won’t you go ober de riber,
To have a little dance tonight?
