1. Come sit you down you darkies and hark to what I sing
  And while I tell de story why make de fiddle ring
Den [words missing from source]
  happier set of darkies dar neber will be seen.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Den sing, sing, sing, sing
and strike the tambourine.
We’ll tell you of a darkey gall
And Julius Cesar Green.

2. A darkey in Virginny libd dey calld him Cesar Green,
  He was so proud and dressd so fine his like was neber seen,
He court a handsome yaller gall from South Carlina State,
  Dey used to dance and sing so well from morn till bery late.

3. Oh Cesar den he married her and took her for his wife,
  Dey lived long and happily and neer had care or strife,
Dey had a picaniny his father’s only pride,
  His mammy was so happy wid him always by her side.

4. And long may they continue with comforts to be blest,
  Until the time arrives for both to take their rest;
And among all other darkies may happiness be seen,
  As tis between dis darkie gal and Julius Cesar Green.
