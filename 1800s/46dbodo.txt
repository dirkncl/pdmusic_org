1. We lib on de banks ob de Ohio,
Tra lal lal la, tral lal lal la,
Whar de mighty waters rapidly flow,
And de steamboat streak along.

CHORUS
We lib on de banks ob de Ohio, Ohio, Ohio,
We lib on de banks ob de Ohio, on de Ohio.

2. Old massa to we darkies am good
Tral lal lal la, tral lal lal la.
He gib us our close, an he gib us our food,
An we merrily work for him.

3. When de day am gone, an our toil am done,
Tral lal lal la, tral lal lal la.
To de cabin we go and hab our fun–
Sweet music dar we excourse.

4. Droop not, darkies, as we hoe
Tral lal lal la, tral lal lal la.
Tilin de banks ob de Ohio,
To raise de bacca and corn.

5. In a berry short time we all must go,
Tral lal lal la, tral lal lal la.
Back to de banks ob de Ohio,
Our home we lub so well.
