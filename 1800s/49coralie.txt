1. 
Ober de ribber we used to float,
Whil I cast de scine from my little boat,
As far and wide my eats I’d fling
And thus ob my lub I’d sweetly sing;
  Oh! Coralie, sweet Coralie,
  How happy I’ve been since you lub’d me,
  Oh! Coralie, sweet Coralie,
  Meet me to night by de cypress tree.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Coralie sweet Coralie,
Meet me tonight by de cypress tree,
Coralie sweet Coralie,
Meet me tonight by de cypress tree.

2. 
At night when de stars shine in de skies,
I’d think ob de light in my true lubs eyes;
As homeward I’d go de woods all ring,
While thus her name I’d sweetly sing.
  Oh! Coralie, sweet Coralie,
  How happy I’ve been since you lub’d me,
  Oh! Coralie, sweet Coralie,
  Meet me to night by de cypress tree.

3. 
Those days are all past and now no more,
I merrily sing by de riber shore;
On me her looks no longer beam,
And soff broods o’er my life’s dull stream.
  Oh! Coralie, my Coralie,
  How mournful I’ve been since you left me,
  Oh! Coralie my, Coralie,
  We meet no more by de cypress tree.

4. 
Some moonlight night false Coralie,
My sheeted ghost you’ll dimly see,
While from my lips dis mournful song,
Shall chill your heart as it floats along.
  Oh! Coralie, false Coralie,
  I died ’cause you would not love me,
  Oh! Coralie, false Coralie,
  I’m sleeping under de cypress tree.
