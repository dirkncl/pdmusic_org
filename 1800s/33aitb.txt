1. Oh Roasa dear Rosa I know they say,
 That my Love's lighter than air,
And that I can always adapt my lay,
 To the first Maid that is fair.
But if before Rosa taught me,
 To worship a brighter flame,
Some gleaming Star has caught me,
 Oh say,-- "am I to blame"?

2. 'Tis only by gazing on darker things
 That we know Lilies are white;
'Tis only by viewing a Raven's wing,
 That we prize flumes that are bright;
And if in my sportive hours
 I've learrit that the Rose must shame,
The sweets of all other Flowers,--
 Oh say,-- "am I to Blame"?

3. A first Love can never grow cold they say
 Till the eye's lustre is dim,
But that which looks very like Love today
 May turn out merely a Whim.
My little mistakes are past Love
 (Never give them a harsher name)
And thou art my first and my last Love,
 Then say,-- "am I to Blame"?
