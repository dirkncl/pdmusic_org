1. Oh! heard ye that shout!
We have conquered the foe” 
How it rings and reechoes o’er mountain and plain!
But, alas! with it mingles the sad note of woe— 
“A hero has perish‘d— brave Ringgold is slain!” 
“A hero has perish’d— brave Ringgold is slain!” 

2. They have laid him to rest on a far distant shore,
Where the Rio del Norte in his majesty flows,
And millions of freemen his loss will deplore,
And weep o’er the spot where his ashes repose.
And weep o’er the spot where his ashes repose.

3. Though dimmed is the eye of the hero, forever,
And hushed is his voice in the stillness of death,
His spirit will hover around those who never
Deserted their leader till life’s latest breath.
Deserted their leader till life’s latest breath.

4. When round them like hail, the death storm shall rattle,
And the warcloud in darkness envelope the plain,
His voice will be heard o’er the din of the battle,
Till victory perch on their banners again.
Till victory perch on their banners again.

5. His name shall live on when the struggle has ceased
And “grim visaged war” from our borders has flown,
When the era of freedom has so far increased,
That its bounds can be traced on the ocean alone.
That its bounds can be traced on the ocean alone.
