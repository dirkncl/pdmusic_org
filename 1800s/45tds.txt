1. The moon rose o’er the battle plain, 
And smil’d from her dark throne 
Upon the wounded and the slain, 
Left bleeding there alone, 
A maiden sought that place of death, 
And gazing round the scene, 
She caught a faintly passing breath, 
And knelt upon the green. 
“Oh! Mary dear, why art thou here! 
Cried one she bended o’er, 
“Our friends have fled— 
Our freedom’s dead— 
It is our home no more— 
Then, Mary, dearest Mary fly 
And leave, Oh! leave me here to die. 

2. What still upon the gory ground 
This bleak and fearful sight. 
Friends hold their sent tries around. 
Too horrid for your sight. 
Oh, if thou pray’st pray not for me, 
But for each breathing slave.  
T’were better far, not being free, 
To perish with the brave. 
Oh, Mary dear, forgive this tear, 
Not for myself ’tis shed, 
With thee alone I could live on 
Tho’ all the world were dead— 
Then, Mary, dearest Mary fly 
And leave Oh, leave me here to die.
