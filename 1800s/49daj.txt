1.
DINE.
You are going o'er the mountains far away from your poor Dine.
I hope you'll never forget the love of her you leave behind.
Oh I will dream of thee my love wherever you may go.
The tears will flow in to my eyes when I think of you dear Joe.
When you promenade the streets Joe or in the Ballroom shine
Oh will you think of her that loves and hears you in her mind?
With a Lady on your arm or sitting on your knee
You'll be making love to her you're with and never think of me,
You'll be making love to her you're with and never think of me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ho, ho, ho!
Don't go Joe,
Stay along with Dinah, do Joe, do.
Ho, ho, ho!
Don't go Joe,
Stay along with Dinah, do Joe, do.
The fire is a burning
Don't go Jue.
The hoe cake's done.
Don't go Joe.
Go home in the morning.
Stay along with Dinah do Joe, do.

2.
JOE.
Oh I'll think of thee dear Dine wherever I may roam.
My heart it will fly back to you and make my think of home.
But if fortune leads the way you'll be ever in my mind.
Oh happy, happy will I be when I call you wife dear Dine.
If I was king of Africa I would never from you roam.
I'd make you Queen of this nigger's heart and always stay at home.
Oh my heart with love is breaking Dine, I cannot leave you so.
Upon that she gave me one fond kiss and said farewell dear Joe,
Upon that she gave me one fond kiss and said farewell dear Joe.
