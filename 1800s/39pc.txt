1.
[Patrick]
Sweet Kathleen dear I'm now come here,
With love's impatient choking
I can't forget your last nights, pet,
But I think you was only joking
My Cain's built, my Ground is tilt
I've been neither proud nor lazy,
So come hard by and the Priest shall try
To make you Mistress Casey.

[Refrain sung after each verse]
Ri tal di ral di ral too di ral di lal
Tal di ral di ri do.

2.
[Kathleen]
Indeed, young Pat, I shant do that,
Your courtship you may clear up
The rich exciseman is now my prizeman,
At you I shall turn my nose up;
He's brough a gown would make you state
A bonnet would drive you crazy,
His wealth and riches I must share
So march off Patrick Casey.

3.
[Patrick]
Sweet Kathleen dear, you cant see clear,
For gold you'd turn the worms up,
You'll calm that brow, and I'll tach ye how
For you'll spoil that nose if it turns up;
The thundering theif with gold in store--
But I'll try to keep my rage in,
So when next we meet I'll make so bold
By the powers I'll spoil his gaging.

4.
[Patrick]
Shall form like this his splendour wave,
And grace his form so homely,
Shall lips like these his knees share
While Patrick is laying lowly;
Shall eyes like these, the fairest sluts--
Delight his sons and grandsons,
Shall teeth like these crack all his nuts
And perhaps he may find you deaf ones.

5.
[Kathleen]
Pray stay your gustering Master Pat,
Perhaps you've seen a winter day
He's not so old if it comes to that--
[Patrick]
He was sixty five last birth day;
[Kathleen]
Well that is no so old I'm sure,
For one that can smile and plaze ye.
[Patrick]
It's a trifling fault that time can't cure
It's too old for a Mistriss Cazey.

6.
[Kathleen]
Come Mr Impudence no more prate,
On your betters you scorn you're showing
Young Judy, at Chapel perhaps may wait
And you see you grapes are scooring;
My dear exciseman's bought me books,
I'm learning I'm much advancing
A Frenchman who divinely looks,
He has hired to teach me dancing.

7.
[Kathleen]
When I'm his wife I've got a tongue,
And if your arts be trying
You'll find although he's old I'm young
[Patrick]
Well that's what I'm not denying;
[Kathleen]
He's got a watch.
[Pattrick] I've got a boar,
A Cow that give milk and custard,
[Kathleen]
He's got a thousand pounds or more--
[Patrick]
When he's yours he'll not want for mustard.

8.
[Patrick]
Miss Kathleen I've just got one say,
For my love you are greatly schocking
As you old exciseman comes this way,
I'll show you the back of my stocking--
When I am gone you'll dance and sing,
Your wealth will drive you crazy,
But I'll find out Judy, I've bought the ring
And I'll soon make her Mistriss Cazey.

9.
[Kathleen]
Dear Patrick stay,--
[Patrick]
be quiet I say--
[Kathleen]
You should not scorn or flout me,
[Patrick]
What signifies this cold delay--
[Kathleen]
You know I can't do without ye;
[Patrick]
You exciseman's bought you showy rags,
[Kathleen]
How can you be so provoking,
[Patrick]
You said you lov'd his wealth and bags,
[Kathleen]
You know I was only joking.

10.
[Patrick]
Sweet Kathleen give those lips divine
Was all this done to taze me--
[Kathleen]
Dear Patrick do forgive this time,
And I'll do what I can to ye;
I'll henceforth make your sweet repose
So make your mind quite easy,
I'll make your meal, I'll mend your hoze
[Patrick]
Then I'll make you Mrs. Cazey.
