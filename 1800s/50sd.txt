De moon am shining light and clear,
De Bullfrog is singing in de riber near,
My old log canoe am light and free,
And de riber stops running to wait for de.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den Suzy dear hab no fear,
De moon am shining light and clear,
But come to me and you shall see,
Dis darkey's always true to de.

2.
De Coon and de Possum am stealin corn
Old Massa sleeps til de day does dawn
An de crickets sing so loud and clear
Ad de words dey say am "Susy dear."

3.
Come Susy come for de day's work's done
An de hoe cake it am waitin for de
An dis darkey's foot am beatin de note
For a dance way down on de ole Peedee.

4.
Den Susy cum for de Banjo tum,
An de darkey's dey am dancin a reel
My ole canoe like an ole ober shoe
Am waitin for Miss Susy's heel.
