1.
Thou art gone awa', thou art gone awa'.
Thou art gone awa' from me Mary.
Nor friends nor I could make thee stay.
Thou hast [claim-ed?] them and me Mary.
Until this hour I never thought
That ought could alter thee Mary.
Thou art still the mistress of my heart.
Think what you will of me Mary

2.
What e'er he said or might pretend
That stole that heart of thine Mary
True love I'm sure was ne'er his end
Or no such Love as mine Mary.
I spoke sincere nor flatter'd much
Had no unworthy thoughts Mary
Ambition, wealth nor naething such;
No I lov'd only thee Mary.

3.
Tho' you've been false, yet while I live
No other maid I'll woo Mary;
Till friends forget and I forgive
Thy wrongs to them and me Mary
So then farewell, of this be sure,
Since you've been false to me Mary.
For all the world I'd not endure,
Half what I've done for thee Mary.
