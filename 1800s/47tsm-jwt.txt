1. As I stray’d from my cot at the close of the day, 
  To muse on the beauties of June 
’Neath a jassamine shade, I replied a fair maid, 
  And she sadly comlain’d to the moon.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Roll on silver moon; guide the trav’ler his way,
  While the nightingale’s song is in tune;
I never, never more with my true love will stray
  By the sweet silver light of the moon.

2. As the hart on the mountain, my lover was brave,
  So handsome, and manly to view;
So kind and sincere, and he loved me most dear,
  O, Edwin no love was more true.

3. But now he is dead, and the youth once so gay,
  Is cut down like a rose in full bloom;
And he silently sleeps, and I’m thus left to weep
  By the sweet silver light of the moon.

4. But his grave I’ll seek out untill morning appears,
  And weep for my lover so brave;
I’ll embrace the cold earth, and bedew with my tears
  The flowers that bloom o’er his grave.

5. O never again can my heart throb with joy,
  My “lost one” I hope to meet soon;
And kind friends will weep o’er the grave where we sleep,
  By the sweet silver light of the moon.
