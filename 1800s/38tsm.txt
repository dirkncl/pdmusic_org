1.
The silver moon is in the sky,
The stars are shining bright,
And every breeze that murmer's by,
Seems whisp'ring of delight.

Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar
Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar.

2.
The waters o'er the lakes are clear,
On them the moonbeams play,
My little bark is waiting there,
To hear my love a way

Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar,
Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar.

[MINOR]
Hark the gentle birds of night
Carol their plaintive song,
And softly o'er the lakes of light,
It seems to float along ... along

Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar,
Come love and roam with me afar,
And listen to my sweet Guitar.
