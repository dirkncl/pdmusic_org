1. Oh what enchanting pleasure 
On de light Bombastie toe 
To dance de Polka measure 
Or thro’ de Waltz to go 
Specially wid de wenus 
Dat holds your heart in thrall. 
What sweet words pass between us 
At de color’d Fancy Ball. 
Now den Gemblemen please to be quiet, 
De Ball am gwarn to begin, 
If you dair make a mus or a riot 
’Twill cost you a kick on de shin. 
Now de music sweetly sound, 
Dark eyes now are dancing. 
Chasses croises prombermade. 
Oh de joys ob dancing! 
Now ’tis the time to whisper soft things, 
Sigh as if gwain to expire. 
Talk ob dat little blind boy dats got wings, 
Den swear dat your heart am on fire 
Oh what enchanting pleasure 
On de light Bombastle toe 
To dance de Polka measure 
Or thro’ de Waltz to go.

2. Observe dat lubly Juno,
Wid de luxurant head ob wool;
She beats all de gals dat you know,
I guess above a jug full.
Jus look how she toe and heel it,
And she ballensays to de crowd;
And dat color’d gent seems to feel it,
For no gobble was ever so proud.
See he offers a glass ob ice cream,
Wid a real silver spoon jus stuck in it;
She  takes it but surely I dream,
For by golly it’s gone in a minute.
See dat Nig in de blue satin vest,
Wid his heel sticking out a feet sirs;
Cutting such capers and doing his best,
To charm eb’ry gal dat he meet sirs.
Sich a darky as dat has no right at de ball,
Tell him to quit and be off;
He had two years in Singsing and came out last fall,
For picking up tings on de warf,
And now he takes his pleasures,
On his light babbastie toe;
As dance de polka measure,
Or thro’ de Waltz he go.
