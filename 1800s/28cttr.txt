1. Gin ’a body meet a body, coming through the rye. 
Gin a body kiss a body, need a body cry 
Lika body has a body, ne’er a one ha’e I, 
But a’ the lads they loe one weel, and what the deuce care I?

2. Gin a body meet a body, coming through the broom,
Gin a body kiss a body, need a body gloom?
Lika Jenny has her Jocky, ne’er a one have I,
But a’ the lad they loe one weel, and what the duce care I?
