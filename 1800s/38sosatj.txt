1. Sweet, oh, sweet are the joys, round Lilla’s Cot doth grow. 
The limpid stream like Lilla’s voice, enchantingly does flow; 
Sweet, oh, sweet are the joys round Lilla’s Cot doth grow. 
The limpid stream like Lilla’s voice, enchantingly does flow; 
I’ve often sat, with rapture and delight, 
A list’ning to the Nightingale, the songstress of the night, 
Still, Still I’ve never heard, such notes as can compare, 
To those my Lilla warbles forth, when ev’ning shades appear. 

[REFRAIN sung after each voice]
Sweet, oh sweet are the joys, round Lilla’s Cot doth grow, 
The limpid stream like Lilla’s voice, enchantingly does flow. 
Sweet, oh sweet are the joys, round Lilla’s Cot doth grow, 
The limpid stream like Lilla’s voiee, enchantingly does flow, 
doth flow, doth flow, Enchantingly does flow.

2. Could, oh, could we partake, of heav’nly joys on earth? 
Tis Lilla’s Cot, tis Lilla’s voice, defusing hea’nly mirth; 
Could, oh, could we partake, of heav’nly joys  on earth? 
Tis Lilla’s Cot, tis Lilla’s voice, defusing heav’nly mirth; 
Come let us go, and see my Lilla’s Cot, 
Along the banks whre limpid streams, continually do flow 
There, there my Lilla dear will warble notes of love, 
Enchanting all within her bow’r, as Angels do above.
