1.
Come to de Old Gum Tree,
  Whar de coon and de possum prance,
O, come you nigs wid me,
  And join in de jovial dance.
De coon he is above us,
  His meal is in de tree.
We know dat he don't love us,
  But fond of him are we.

CHORUS
Den come to de Ole Gum Tree,
  Whar de coon and de possum prance,
O come you nigs wid me,
  And join in de jovial dance.
O, come you nigs wid me,
  And join in de jovial dance.

2.
Oh, de wood and its yaller leaves,
  Oh, de cotton plants and flowers,
Den come you niggers wid us,
  For a merry life is ours.
Around us, and above us,
  De banjo's sweetest notes,
And de voices ob de niggers,
  Come rolling from dar throats.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come to de ole oak tree,
  So softly boys as you can,
And we'll go to de Ole Gum Tree,
  And catch dat coon if we can.
Dat nigger plays de fiddle,
  And I de tambourine,
We're de happiest set ob niggers,
  Dat eber fore was seen.

(CHORUS)
