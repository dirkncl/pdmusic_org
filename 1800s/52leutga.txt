1. Dry the tears for holy Eva,
With the blessed angels leave her,
Of the form so sweet and fair
Give to earch the tender care.
For the golden locks of Eva,
Let the sunny south land give her
Flowery pillow of repose,
Orange bloom and budding rise,
Orange bloom and budding rose.

2. All is light and peace with Eva,
There the darkness cometh never,
Tears are wiped and fetters fall,
And the Lord is all in all.
Weep no more for happy Eva,
Wrong and sin no more shall grieve her,
Care and pain and weariness,
Lost in love so measureless,
Lost in love so measureless.

2. All is light and  peace with Eva,
There the darkness cometh never,
Tears are wiped and fetters fall,
And the Lord is all in all.
Weep no more for happy Eva
Wrong and sin no more shall grieve her,
Care and pain and weariness
Lost in love so measureless,
Lost in love so measureless.

3. Gentle Eva loving Eva,
Child confessor, true beleiver,
Listen’r at the Master’s knee,
“Suffer such to come to me,”
Of for faith like thine, sweet Eva,
Lighting all the solemn river,
And the blessing of the poor
Wafting to the heavenly shore,
Wafting to the heavenly shore.
