1.
Oh, I was born in ole Virginny
And my little gal's name was Dine;
She always call'd me a prettier nigger
than Dandy Jim ob Caroline.

CHORUS [after each verse]
My rafts by the shore, she's light and free,
To be a jolly raftsman is the life for me;
And as we glide along, our song shall be,
Dearest Dinah, I love but thee.

2.
Come, oh, come wid me my dearest lub,
I'll take you to the Northern states,
And you shall keep de oyster celler,
Oh! you shall hurry up dem cakes.

3.
I'll bid good bye to ole Viriginny,
I now will take my last farewell;
And if I marry you, my dearest Dine,
We will in peace and happiness dwell.
