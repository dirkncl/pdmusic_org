1. Oh! I was born in Tenesee
  was de sihts de boys do see
Oh I did wake dem ebry morn
  and did de way I blowd my horn

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh! wake up in de morning
Oh! wake up in de morning
Oh! wake up in de morning
afor de brake ob day.

2. My massa owned a pretty gal
  De folks dey called her yaller Sal
De greatest gal in that big place
  Wid de broadest foot and blackest face

3. Dis Sal was tall as you could see
  Her shape was like de poplar tree
And when she passed de dogs dey howled
  De bullfrogs screamed and tadpoles growl'd

4. And Sal she had a lubly moufe
  Twould reach de poles from norfe to soufe
And when it oped from ear to ear
  You'll jump about a foot from fear

5. De Darkies once did gib a ball
  Dey hab it at de darkies hall
So Sall and I to de ball did go
  War as did cut de biggest show

6. While Sal was dancing in a reel
  A nigger stept upon her heel
She turned around to gib a grin
  Open'd her mouth and her head fell in

7. Day formed a jury on de spot
  De Darkies sweet it was so hot
But pity changed to deep despair
  When her leg give a jerk and her body wasn't dere
