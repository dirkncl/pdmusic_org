RECITATIVE
Ah when I came, all these dear friends were gone;
The Brother of the Prefect too was dead, and then I was alone,
Ah quite alone; until I met my Carlo who lov’d me still and pitied me,
and took me to his Mother’s house,
yet here in these luxurious halls let me remember still,
the scenes of childhood, and sing the song I love so well,

1. On the banks of Guadalquiver,
By the birght and flowing river,
While I’ve watch’d its gentle tide,
With a tranquil murmur glide,
Hath my heart ne’er ceas’d to pine,
For the calmness which is thine,
Oh beloved Guadalquiver,
Oh, beloved Guadalquiver,
While I’ve watch’d thy gentle tide,
With a tranquil murmur glide,
Hath my heart ne’er ceas’d to pine
For the calmness which is thine.

2. On the banks of Guadalquiver,
By the bright and flowing river
I have fancied while I wept,
O’er the waves which by me leapt,
That the joys of life thus may,
Just as swiftly pass away
As thy waters Guadalquiver,
Oh, beloved Guadalquiver
While I’ve watch’d thy gentle tide,
With a tranquil murmur glide,
Hath my heart ne’er ceas’d to pine,
For the calmness which is thine.
