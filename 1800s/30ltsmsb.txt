1. Lady the silver moon shines bright!
Her beams disperse the dews of night;
Then Lady, let thy presence cheer
Thy Lover who awaits thee here!
Then Lady let thy presence cheer
Thy Lover who awaits thee here!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Lady the silver moon shines bright!
Her beams disperse the dews of night:
Her beams disperse the dews of night,
Her beams disperse the dews of night.

2. Let the soft lustre of thine eyes
Dispers thy Lover’s anxious sighs!
And thy sweet voice which breaths divine,
Be tuned to love as well as mine.
