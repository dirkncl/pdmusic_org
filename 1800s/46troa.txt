1.
Away from Mississipi's vale,
Wid my ole hat dar for a sail,
I cross'd upon a cotten bale,
  To Rose ob Alabama.

CHORUS
Oh, brown Rosey,
De Rose ob Alabama,
A sweet tobacco posey
Is de Rose of Alabama
A sweet tobacco posey
Is de Rose of Alabama.

2.
I landed on de sand bank,
I sat upon a holler plank,
An' dare I made the banjo twank,
  For Rose of Alabama.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh, arter d'rectley, by an' bye,
De moon rose white as Rosey's eye,
Den like a young coon out so sly,
  Stole Rose ob Alabama.

(CHORUS)

4.
I axe her set down whar she please,
So cross my legs she took her ease,
"It's good to go upon de knees,"
  Says Rose ob Alabama.

(CHORUS)

5.
De river rolled, de crickets sing,
De lighnin' bug he flash'd his wing,
And like a rope my arms I fling
  Round Rose of Alabama.

(CHORUS)

6.
I his so long I cannot tell,
For Rosey seemed to like it well,
My banjo in de river fell,
  Ob Rose ob Alabama.

(CHORUS)

7.
Like alligator orter prey,
I plunge in, but it float away,
But all de time it seemed to say,
  "Oh, Rose ob Alabama."

(CHORUS)

8.
And ev'ry night in moon or shower,
To hunt dat banjo for an hour,
I meet my sweet tobacco flower,
  My Rose of Alabama.

CHORUS
Sing, oh, brown Rosey,
De Rose ob Alabama,
A sweet tobacco posey
Is de Rose of Alabama
A sweet tobacco posey
Is de Rose of Alabama.
