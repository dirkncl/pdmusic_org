1. My Willie’s on the dark blue sea,
  He’s gone far o’er the main,
And many a weary day will pass
  Ere he’ll come back again.

CHORUS 1-4 [sung after VERSEs 1-4]
Then blow gentle winds o’er the dark blue sea,
Bid the stormking star his hand,
And bring my Willie back to me,
To his own dear native land.

2. I love my Willie best of all,
  He e’er was true to me,
But lonesome, dreary are the hours
  Since first he went to sea.

3. There’s danger on the water now,
  I hear the blondhills cry;
And moaning voices seem to speak
  From out the cloudy sky.

4. I see the vivid lightnings flash,
  And hark! the thunder’s roar;
Oh Father, save my Willie from
  The stormking’s mighty power.

5. And as she spoke the lightning ceased,
  Hushed was the thunder’s roar;
And Willie clasped her in his arms,
  To roam the seas no more.

CHORUS 5
Now blow gentle winds o’er the dark blue sea,
  No more we’ll stay thy hand;
Since Willie’s safe at home with me,
  In his own dear native land.
