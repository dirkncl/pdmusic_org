1. There’s one I fondly love;
She’s more than dear to me, 
At twilight oft I rove, 
To meet my Fanny Lee, 

REFRAIN
[sung, followed by VERSE once again, after each VERSE]
Tra la la la la la la 
Tra la la la la la la la la 
Tra la la la la la la 
Tra la la la la la la la  la la la 


2. She has dimpled cheek,
And eyes you’d love to view,
And rosy lips that speak
So gentle, kind, and true.

3. We wander in the vales,
Or sit beside the stream,
And whisper many tales
As rippling waters gleam.

4. She’s called the village pride;
Her heart is light and free;
I’m happy by the side
Of little Fanny Lee.
