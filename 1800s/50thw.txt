1. She’s my myrtle, my geranium, 
My sunflow’r, my sweet marjoram, 
My honey suckle, my tulip, my violet, 
My hollyhock, my dahlia, my mignonette. 

CHORUS [sung after verses 1-5 only]
Ho! ho! she’s a fickle wild rose, 
A damask, a cabbage, a china rose. 
Ho! ho! she’s a fickle wild rose, 
A damask, a cabbage, that everybody knows.

2. She´s my snowdrop, my ranunculus, 
My hyacinth, my gilly flow’r, my polyanthus; 
My heart’s ease, my pink, my water lily, 
My buttercup, my daisy, my daffy-down dilly.

3. [omitted]

4. I am like a scarlet runner, that has lost its stick,
Or a cherry, that is left for the dickey birds to pick;
Like a watering pot, I’ll weep, like pavion, I’ll sigh,
Like a mushroom, I’ll wither, like a cucumber, I’ll die.

5. I am like a bumblebee that don’t know where to settle,
And she is a dandellion, and a stinging nettle;
My heart’s like a beet-root, choked with a chick­-weed,
My head’s like a pumpkin, running off to seed.

6. I’ve a great mind to make myself a fe­-lo-de-se,
And finish all my woes on the branch of a tree;
But I won’t! for I know that at my kicking you’d roar;
And honour my death with a double encore.

CHORUS [sung last time only]
Ho! ho! who would suppose,
I’d suffer so much by that fickle wild rose.
Ho! ho! who would suppose,
I’d suffer so much by that fickle wild rose.
