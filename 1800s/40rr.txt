1. It was Yule and the snow kept falling 
In silent shadowy flight, 
Thro’ the dull gray haze of daylight, 
Far in to the starless night; 
And father sat close by the fireside, 
With the children round his knee, 
And every bonny brown face was there, 
But the one that was as sea. 
Never a letter and never a word, 
And my eyes with tears were dim, 
As I wreathed the holly upon the wall, 
And hark’d to the children’s hymn. 
And father said as they carolled  on, 
With a smile nigh like a tear, 
This Christmas will scarce be Christmas, wife, 
If our boy should not be here, 
If our boy should not be here. 

2. The Never a sound but the crackling log, 
And the wind amid the thatch, 
Till the clock was past the stroke of twelve, 
When a finger rais’d the latch, 
A merry brown face stood at the door, 
The face I lov’d the best, 
And the snow in the curls of Robin 
Lay melting on my breat! 
Dear granny she rose from her corner 
And clapped   her hands in glee, 
And she said “O roving Robin, 
You must keep a kiss for me! 
And there’s some one else will want one too, 
Who left not long ago!” 
“Ah she get it” quoth Robin laughing 
“When I met her in the snow” 
“Ah she got it” quoth Robin laughing 
“When I met her in the snow. 

3. The wheel in the nook stood all unturn’d, 
And I saw not granny’s face; 
But the tears dropp’d under the wrinkled hands, 
Held toward the Yule log blaze; 
Poor Bessie she turn’d to the doorway 
With face both pale and sad, 
So I kiss’d her cheek ere we parted 
For love of my sailor lad. 
As I look’d down the driftdimm’d pathway I said, 
“There’s one, there’s one we know, 
Would have given a good deal darling, 
To have seen you thro’ the snow!! 
Then we drew near the hearth together, 
And listened side by side 
In the first blithe peel of the merry bells, 
Which welcome Christmas tide 
Which welcome Christmas tide.
