1. Holy, holy, holy Lord! 
Be thy  glorious name ador’d; Lord! 
thy mercies never fail; 
Hail celestial goodness hail! 
Though unworthy, Lord, thine ear Deign 
our humble songs to hear; 
Though unworthy, Lord, thine ear Deign 
our humble songs to hear; 
Purer praise we hope to bring, 
When around thy throne we sing.

2. There no tongue shall silent be,
All shall join in harmony;
That through Heaven’s capricious round,
Praise to thee may ever sound.
Lord! thy mercies never fail,
Hail, celestial goodness, hail!
Lord! thy mercies never fail,
Hail, celestial goodness, hail!
Holy, holy, holy, Lord!
Be thy glorious name ador’d.
