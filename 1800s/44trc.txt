1. 
Come listen to my story ye landsmen one and all, 
I’ll sing to you the dangers of that raging Canal, 
For I am one of many who expects a watery grave, 
For I’ve been at the mercy of the wind and of the wave.

2. 
When we left New York harbor it was the middle of the year, 
We put our helm hard a port and for Buffalo did steer, 
But when we got in sight of Alba’y we me a heavy squall, 
And we carried away our main mast on that Raging Canal.

3. 
She minded her helm just like a thing of life, 
The mate got on his knees uttering a prayer for his wife, 
We throwed the provisions overboard it was blowing such a squall, 
And we were put on short allowance on that Raging Canal.

4. 
It seemed as if the devil had work in hand that night,
For our oil it was all gone, and our lamps they gave no light,
The clouds began to gather and the rain began to fall,
And we had to rent out royals on that Raging Canal.

5. 
Loud roared the dreadful thunder, the rain in deluge showered,
The clouds were rent asunder, by lightnings vivid powers,
The bows-men gave a bellow, and the rook she gave a squall,
And the waves run mountain high on that Raging Canal.

6. 
The Captain came on deck and then began to rail,
He bellowed to the driver to take in more sail,
The driver knocked a horse down and then gave a howl,
And we scudded under bare pulse on that Raging Canal.
