PART FIRST
==========
Represents the May Queen, full of joyousness and hope in on
the Eve of May Day.

PART SECOND
============
New Year's Eve--declined in health, requesting her Mother
to call her to see the Sun rise upon the New Year--a sight
she never expects to enjoy again.

PART THIRD
===========
The return of Spring--still alive, when the first flowers
are cut--"The beautiful Blue Violets"--expecting to die,
with the assurance of a blessed Immortality--informing her
Mother and sister Effie, that she has been called to
Heaven by the Angels.

I thouht to pass awaw before, and yet alive I am;
And in the fields all round I hear the bleating of the lamb.
How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!
To die before the snowdrop came, and now the violets here.
Oh sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies,
And sweeter is the young lamb’s voice to me that cannot rise,
And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that blow,
And sweeter far is death than life to me that long to go.
I did not hear the dog howl, mother, or the deathwatch beat,
There came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet:
But sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,
And Effie on the other side and I will tell the sign.

All in the wild Marchmorning I heard the angels call;
It was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;
The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,
And in the wild Marchmorning I heard them call my soul.
For lying broad awake I thought of you and Effie dear;
I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here;
With all my strength I pray’d for both, and so I felt resign’d,
And up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.
I thought that it was fancy, and I listen’d in my bed,
And then did something speak to me— I know now what was said;
For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,
And up the valley came again the music on the wind.
But you were sleeping, and I said, “It’s not for them: it’s mine.”
And if it comes three times, I thought, I take it for a sign.
And once again it came, and close beside my window bars,
Then seem’d to go right up to heaven, and die among the stars.
So now I think my time is near. I trust it is. I only know
The blessed music went that way my soul will have to go
And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go today.
But, Effie, you must comfort her when I am passed away.

O look! the sun begins to rise, the heavens are in a glow;
He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know.
And there I move no longer now, and there his light may shine—
Wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.

O sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is done
The voice, that now is speaking, may be beyond the sun—
For ever and for ever with those just souls and true—
And what is life, that we should moan? why make we such ado?
For ever and for ever, all in a blessed home—
And there to wait a little while till you and Effie come—
To lie within the light of God as I lie upon your breast—
And the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.
