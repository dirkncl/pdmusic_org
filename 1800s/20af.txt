1. When distance severs kindred souls, 
Affection’s lasting tie ne’er sends, 
But fancy roves where ocean rolls, 
And loves to dwell with absent friends; 
But fancy roves where ocean rolls, 
And loves to dwell with absent friends. 
Then smiling hope’s delusive ray, 
Its care dispelling influence sends; 
Then smiling hope’s delusive ray, 
Its care dispelling influence sends; 
And gilds the hours that pass away, 
From those we love 
From Absent friends; 
From those we love 
From Absent friends   
From Absent friends 
From those we love 
From Absent friends, 
From Absent friends.

 2. Oh can there be in life a charm, 
More sweet that retrospection lends, 
When dwells the heart with rapture warm, 
On past delights and absent friends, 
When dwells the heart with rapture warm,  
On past delights and absent friends. 
That soothing charm I would not lose, 
For all the bliss that wealth at tends; 
That soothing charm I would not lose, 
For all the bliss that wealth attends; 
Its joys could ne’er a calm infuse, 
So sweet as thought 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends, 
Of Absent friends.
