1.
I have never been false to thee,
The heart I gave thee still is thine,
Though thou hast been untrue to me,
And I no more may call thee mine;
I've loved, as woman ever loves,
With constant soul in good or ill;
Thou'st proved, as man too often proves,
A rover-- but I love thee still.
  Thou'st proved, as man too often proves,
  A rover-- but I love thee still.

2.
Yet think not that my spirit stoops,
To bind thee captive to my train;
Love's not a flow'r, at sunset droops
But smiles when comes her god again;
Thy words, which fall unheeded now,
Could once my heart=strings madly thrill,
Love's golden chain and burning vow
Are broken but I love thee still,
  Love's golden chain and burning vow
  Are broken but I love thee still.

3.
Once what a heav'n of bliss was ours!
When love dispell'd the cloud of care!
And time went by with birds and flow'rs,
While song and incense fill'd the air!
The past is mine, the present thine,
Should thoughts of me thy future fill,
Think what a destiny is mine,
To lose-- but love thee false one still.
  Think what a destiny is mine,
  To lose-- but love thee false one still.
