1.
And said I that my limbs were old;
And said I that my blood was cold,
And that my kindly fire was fled,
And my poor wither'd heart was dead,
And that I might not sing of love:
How could I to the dearest theme,
That ever warm'd a minstrels dream,
So foul, so false a recreant prove!
How could I name love's very name,
Nor wake my harp to notes of flame!

In peace, Love tunes the shepherds reed;
In war, he mounts the warriors steed;
In halls, in attire is seen;
In hamlets dances on the green,
In hamlets dances on the green.

Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below and Saints above;
For love is heav'n,
And heav'n is love,
For love is heav'n, and heav'n is love.
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below
And Saints above;
For love is heav'n, and heav'n is love.
For love is heav'n,
And heav'n is love.
