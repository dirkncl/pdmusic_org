1. March! March, Etrick and Teviot Dale!
Why my lads dinna ye March, forward in order, 
March March, Eskdale and Liddlesdale!
All the blue Bonnets are over the border.
Many a Banner spread, flutters above your head, 
Many a Crest that is famous in Story, 
Mount and make ready, then sons of the Mountain glen, 
Fight for your King, and the old Scottish border.

2. Come from the hills where your hirsels are grazing,
Come from the glen of the buck and the roe,
Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,
Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow.
Trumpets are sounding, 
War Steeds are bounding,
Stand to your arms and 
March in good order.
ENGLAND shall many a day, 
Tell of the bloody fray,
When the blue Bonnets came over the border.
