1. 
As I was sailin’ on de ole canal,
I met wid my dear colour’d gal;
She look’d jes like a charcoal rose,
Her face so dark she scared de crows. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]

I’m sailin’ on de ole canal,
Tra la la la la la la la la,
Such a beautiful form is my colour’d gal,
Tra la la la la la la la la,
Such a beautiful form is my colour’d gal,
Tra la la la la la la la la.

2. 
O! Pomp she cried come hidder to me,
Or I’ll hang myself on dat ole pine tree;
I’ve treasured you long as a coloured prize,
I’ve waited here wid tears in my eyes.

3. 
O! yes dear Fanny I’ll be dar soon.
You’re handsome as dat ole new moon;
Your form is as fair as any spring wedder,
So jump on board and we’ll sail off togedder.

4. 
De earth did quake and de breakers roar,
When she came on board and left de shore;
De boat did dance wid joy to see,
My coloured gal sail off wid me.
