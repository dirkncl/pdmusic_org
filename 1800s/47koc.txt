CHORUS
  Before I got my freedom.

Clar to de Mississippi's mouf

  And each look'd more diviner,
But none can fill dis heart an head,
  Like Kate ob Carolina.

My Massa bid me hoe de weed,
  From round de tater vine sa,
But de only vine dar dat I seed,
  Was Kate ob Carolina.

SOLO
A lock ob hair for me she pull,
CHORUS
  Before I got my freedom;
SOLO
'Twas soft as new born Goose's wool,
CHORUS
  Before I got my freedom;
SOLO
I twist it into Banjo strings,
  Its music was divine ah,
But de only tune dat I would sing,
  Was Kate ob Carolina.
CHORUS
But de only tune dat I would sing,
  Was Kate ob Carolina.
