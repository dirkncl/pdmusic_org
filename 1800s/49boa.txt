1. One morning in de month ob may, 
Way down in Alabama, 
Dis darkey dress him up so gay, 
To meet his Julieanna;

CHORUS [sung after verse]
O Julie, O Julie, I’d kiss dose lubly lips ob dine, 
O Julie, O Julie, when shall I call de mine; 
O Julie, O Julie, I’d kiss dose lubly lips ob dine, 
O Julie, O Julie, 
[1-4] when shall I call de mine.
[5] I now do call de mine.

2. My Julie went to church wid me,
Dress’d in dat modest stile;
While I walk’d by her side to see,
Her sweet bewitching smile.

3. My massa meet us on de way,
And ssid dat we must marry;
Den Julie blushingly did say,
She would no longer tarry.

4. O how dis heart did leap wid joy,
Dose heabenly words inspire;
No more shall care or toil annoy;
She’s all dat I desire.

5. How happy I shall be trough life,
Wid Julieanna near me;
Belov’d, she is dis darkey’s wife,
Widout a fault to grieve me.
