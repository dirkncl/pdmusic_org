1. Come, listen all you gals and boys,
        Ise just from Tuckyhoe;
I'm goin, to sing a little song,
        My name's Jim Crow.

CHORUS [after every verse]
Weel about and turn about and do jis so,
Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow.

2. I went down to the river,
	I didn't mean to stay;
But dere I see so many gals,
	I couldn't get away.

3. And arter I been dere awhile,
	I tought I push my boat;
But I tumbled in de river,
	And I find myself afloat.

4. I git upon a flat boat,
	I cotch de Uncle Sam;
Den I went to see de place where
	Dey kill'd de Packenham.

5. And den I go to Orleans,
	An, feel so full of flight;
Dey put me in de Calaboose,
	An, keep me dere all night.

6. When I got out I hit a man,
	His name I now forgot;
But dere was noting left of him
	'Cept a little grease spot.

7. And oder day I hit a man,
	De man was mighty fat
I hit so hard I nockt him in
	To an old cockt hat.

8. I whipt my weight in wildcats,
	I eat an alligator;
I drunk de Mississippy up!
	O! I'm de very creature.

9. I sit upon a hornet's nest,
	I dance upon my bead;
I tie a wiper round my neck
	An, den I go to bed.

10. I kneel to de buzzard,
	An, I bow to the crow;
An eb'ry time I weel about
	I jump jis so.
