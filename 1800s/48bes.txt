1. I been to de east, I been to de west,
I been to Souf Car’lina,
And ob all de gals I lub de bes
Is my brack eye’d Susi-anna.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
She’s brack dat’s a fac,
She's brack dat’s a fac.
I been to de east, I been to de west,
I been to Souf Car’lina
And ob all de gals I lub de bes,
Is my brack ey’d Susianna.

2. I courted a gal way in de wes,
Her name it was Jemima—
But I still had a feelin in my bres
For my brack ey’d Susianna.

3. A letter to my lub I wrote
When I was in Indiana—
Eb’ry sentence dit I spoke
Was brack ey’d Susianna.

4. Home I started to my lub,
Her promis to remind her—
Soon herself to me she gub
Dat brack ey’d Susianna.

5. I lub her now wid all my heart;
My ’fections grow sublimer—
Neber more from her I’ll part,
Sweet brack ey’d Susianna.
