from "Melodies of the Harmoneans"
Arranged for the Piano Forte
"O! Lady, Sweetest Lady" (1846)
Serenade
Words by J. S. Davis
Music by L. V. H. Crosby

1.
O! lady sweetest lady,
  Soft slumbers round thee twine,
Sleep on for thou art dreaming
  Of music that's divine.

2.
Thy father's roof protects thee,
  O! would that it were mine,
Sleep on for thou art dreaming
  Of music that's divine.

3.
No sound shall break thy slumbers,
  But let my song be thine,
Sleep on for thou art dreaming
  Of music that's divine.
