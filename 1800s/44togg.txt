1. Monday was my  wedding day,
Tuesday I was married,
Wen’sdy night my wife took sick,
Sat’day she was buried.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Oh! looky har, Oh! looky whar,
Look right ober yander,
Don’t you see de Ole Grey Goose
Smiling at de Gander.

2. Wen’sday night my wife took sick.
Despair ob death cum o’er her.
O! some did cry, but I did laff
To see dat death go from her.

3. I ask Miss Dinah Rose one day
In de ole cart to ride.
She war by gosh so berry fat,
I couldn’t sit beside her.

4. When she was gittin out de cart
Miss Dinah loose her shoe.
And den I spied a great big hole
Right in her stocking through.

5. Says I to her: you Dinah Gal
Only looky dar
Dem heels are sticking out too far
As a niggar I declar.

6. Says she to me you nigger Jo
What are you about,
Dere’s science in dem are heels
And I want em to stick out.
