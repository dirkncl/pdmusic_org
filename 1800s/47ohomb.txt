1. Oh! home of my boybood, my own country home, 
I love it the better wherever I roam;
The lure of proud cities, the wealth of the main, 
Have never a charm like my own native plain;
There waved the old elms on the cottagelined street, 
There warbled the birds from the woodland retreat, 
The roar of the river, the forest crown’d hill, 
The starlight that glisten’d, they dwell with me still.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Oh! home of my boyhood, my own country home, 
I love it the better wherever I roam;
The lure of proud citties, the wealth of the main, 
Have never a charm like my own native plain.

2. I’ve wandered for years through the coldhearted world,
And rode every sea where a sail is unfurled;
I’ve met with the great and the noble of earth,
But never forgotten the home of my birth.
The laugh of my sister, my brother’s high glee,
Are echoing round me whereever I be;
The thousand bright glances from young maiden’s eyes,
Are stars in my heaven, when griefclouds arise.

3. The voice of my father, with deep manly tone,—
There’s music about it no other hath known;
The smile of my mother, that lovelighted brow,—
Oh! mother— dear mother!— they dwell with me now!
I love them,— I love them,— the days of the past,
And nothing shall bride me from keeping them fast;
Oh! home of my boyhood!— My own rural home!—
I’ll love it the better wherever I roam!
