1. In the woods, hunters say, 
It is glorious and gay 
To rush thro’ their sporting career, 
Where the leaves falling red, 
Yield a readymade bed, 
Where they rest after Slaying the Deer. 
On the venison steak jovial feasting they make 
And the flask going round helps the cheer. 
While the logs blazing bright, K
Keep them warm thro’ the night, 
When they rest after Slaying the Deer, 
They rest after Slaying the Deer.

2. But I know a sport 
That is safer resort, 
For wives will complain, if too far, 
You are tempted to steer In persuit of the deer 
And they wonder “wherever you are?” 
So give me the sleigh 
On the while frozen way 
With woman beside me, to cheer, 
Who is never complaining 
How long you’re remaining, 
When _thus_, you are _Sleighing_ the _Dear_ 
When _thus_ you are Sleighing_ the _Dear_.

3. While we gallop full speed 
As we run we   may  read 
She rejoices how fast we have got on, 
While the proud little minx, wrapp’d in bear skin or lynx, 
Just looks like a diamond in cotton. 
Her cheek, red as rose, 
(We won’t speak of the nose) 
Oh, beauty’s a delicate thing— 
Of a bloom on the cheek 
Any poet can speak 
But, (blow it!) a nose we can’t sing. 
But (blow it!) a nose we can’t sing.

4. But never did I
In a sleigh hear a sigh,
In fact there’s no time there for fretting.
As fast as the wind
We leave sorrow behind,
While the cold is our appetite whetting;
When the stomach’s in order,
No mental disorder
Upon any mortal can prey.
If your dear’s temper’s crost,
Pray, at once for the frost,
And fix her right into a sleigh!
And fix her right into a sleigh!

5. If she would, she can’t scold,
For the weather’s so cold,
Her mouth she can’t open at all.
In vain would she cry—
For the tears in her eye
Would be frozen before they could fall;
Then hurrah! for the snow
As we merrilly go
The bells my fleet horses can cheer.
While the _belle_ by my side
Is my joy and my pride,
Oh, there’s nothing like _Sleighing_ the _Dear_.
Oh, there’s nothing like _Sleighing_ the _Dear_.
