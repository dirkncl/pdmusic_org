1.
Ho! the Car Emancipation
Rides majestic thro' our nation
Bearing on its Train, the story,
LIBERTY! a Nations's Glory

[CHORUS]
Roll it along,
Roll it along,
Roll it along,
Thro' the Nation Freedom's Car.
Emancipation
Roll it along,
Roll it along,
Roll it along,
Thro' the Nation Freedom's Car.
Emancipation.

2.
First of all the train and greater,
Speeds the dauntless _Liberator_
Onward cheered amid hosannas,
And the waving of Free Banners.

[CHORUS (in the form as before)]
Roll it along! spread your Banners
While the people shout hosannas.

3.
Men of various predilictions,
Frightened, run in all directions:
Merchants, Editors, Physicians,
Lawyers, Priests and Politicians.

[CHORUS]
Get out of the way! every station.
Clear the track of 'mancipation.

4.
Let the Ministers and Churches
Leave behind sectarian lurches;
Jump on board the Car of Freedom
Ere it be too late to need them.

[CHORUS]
Sound the alarm! Pulpit's thunder!
Ere too late, you see your blunder.

5.
Politicians gazed, astonished,
When, at first our Bell resounded:
_Freight trains_ are coming, tell those Foxes,
With our _Votes_ and _Ballot Boxes_.

[CHORUS]
Jump up for your lives! Politicians,
From your dangerous false positions.


6.
Rail Roads to Emancipation
Cannot rest on _Clay_ foundation
And the _tracks_ of "_The Magigian_"
Are but _Rail Roads_ to perdition.

[CHORUS]
Pull up the Rails! Emancipation
Cannot rest on such foundation.

7.
All true friends of Emancipation,
Haste to Freedom's Rail Road Stations;
Quick into the Cars get seated,
All is ready and completed.

[CHORUS]
Put on the Steam! All are crying,
And the Liberty Flags are flying.

8.
Now, again the Bell is tolling,
Soon you'll see the car wheels rolling;
Hinder not their destination,
Chartered for Emancipation.

[CHORUS]
Mend up the flag! keep it flashing,
While the Train goes onward dashing.

9.
Hear the mighty car wheels humming!
Now look out! _The Engine's running!_
Church and Stateman! hear the thunder!
Clear the track! or you'll fall under.

[CHORUS]
Get off the track! all are singing,
While the Liberty Bell is ringing.

10.
On triumphant, see them bearing,
Through sectarian rubbish tearing;
The Bell and Whistle and the Steaming,
Startles thousands from their dreaming.

[CHORUS]
Look out for the cars! while the Bell rings,
Ere the sound your funeral knell rings.

11.
See the people run to meet us;
At the Depots thousands greet us;
All take seats with exultation,
In the Car Emancipation.

[CHORUS]
Hurra! Hurra! Emancipation
Soon will bless our happy nation.
  Hurra! Hurra!! Hurra!!!
