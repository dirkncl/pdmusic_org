1.
'Twas in de season of de year,
When flowr'ts fair did spring...
When Birds were perch'd up on de trees,
And sweetly dey did sing
I walk'd in to de cotton field,
My mind so free from care and pain
I neber know what was to sigh!
'Till I saw Mary Blane.

GLEE.
Oh, Mary Blane if you'll be mine
I'll toil from morning 'till de night
And you shall be my own true lub,
In truth and fond delight.

2.
I said dear Maid if you'll consent,
I'll make you mine for life,
And we will both as happy be,
Away from care and strife;
Her eyes like diamonds brightly shone,
Her mind so free from guile and stain,
I clasp'd her in my arms wid joy,
My Charming Mary Blane.

(GLEE)

3.
We Married and went far away,
And lib'd beside de sea,
We neber knew a moments care,
From fear and sorrow free;
Untill one day de white man cum,
Wid looks of fierce disdain,
And stole away my lubbly wife,
And I lost Mary Blane.

(GLEE)

4.
Dey took her to a distant shore,
And sold her for a slabe,
But soon de raging feber cum,
And sent her to her grave;
Oh! what to do I cannot tell,
My Heart's so full of pain.
But I shall die, I know full well,
For my sweet Mary Blane.

GLEE.
Adieu! Adieu! dear Mary Blane,
We part, on earth to meet no more,
But we shall meet in heav'n again,
My own sweet Mary Blane.
