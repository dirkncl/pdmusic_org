Words by Silas Sexton Steele, Esq., 1812-?
Composed and Sung by Anthony F. Winnemore

1.
Oh down in Indiana woods,
  Whar color'd Angels grow,
Dar I fust track'd a darkey gal,
  Her name was Dinah Doe;
Her shape was like a sheaf ob corn
  Her step was like de Roe
An my heart an heel was beating
  To follow Dinah Doe.
    Ah my heart an heel was beating
      To follow Dinah Doe.

2.
I foller her thro' flow'ry woods,
  Each step she walk more slow,-
An' when she peeped behind I thought
  The stars had dropt below;
For her eyes where like de risen moon,
  When daylight out does go
And my heart an' heel was beating,
  To foller Dinah Doe.
    And my heart an' heel was beating,
      To foller Dinah Doe.

3.
While looken round, she bumped a tree,
  An' backward down she go,
I catch herin dese trobbing arms
  As an eagle catch a crow
Oh she trembled like a color'd lamb,
  Out in a storm ob snow,
Ah my heart it beat de banjo,
  While I hold sweet Dinah Doe.
    Ah my heart it beat de banjo,
      While I hold sweet Dinah Doe.

4.
I prest de wound, I kiss her lip,
  And she revived not slow;
Her teeth showed like white grains ob corn,
  Laid in a double row,
An her breath was like de summer winds,
  Dat on de clover blow,
Oh she vowed dat night to lope wid me,
  De charming Dinah Doe.
    Oh she vowed dat night to lope wid me,
      De charming Dinah Doe.

5.
I help in my log Canoe,
  An down de stream I row,
I want no light to steer by, but
  De eyes ob Dinah Doe,
Oh we ride fas down de river
  While de waters gaily flow,
I thought her mine for ever
  Dis Charming Dinah Doe.
    I thought her mine for ever
      Dis Charming Dinah Doe.

6.
But her Massa's Driver spy her out,
  While fishen down below,
He shot sweet Dinah thro' de breast,
  And in de stream she go;
Oh! her cry was like a dying dove,
  Right through my soul it go,
And dis poor heart is beating,
  To foller Dinah Doe.
    And dis poor heart is beating,
      To foller Dinah Doe.
