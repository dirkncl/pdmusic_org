1. Oh! fate to pity oh relent 
In tears I bend before thy throne 
My heart alas can ne’er consent 
To plight my hand to one unknown 
To plight my hand to one unknown.

2. Ah! rob me of both riches rank 
If peace and happiness are mine 
With those we love not life’s a blank 
With those we love a gift divine 
With those we love a gift divine.
