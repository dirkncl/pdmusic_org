"Peaceful Are the Night Winds Sighing" (1847)
Duet
Sung at the Concerts of the
Harmoneons & Washington Euterpeans
Composed by L. V. H. Crosby

1.
Peaceful are the night winds sighing,
Soft (the) dew (falls)
Soft the dew falls on the rose
To prevent its fragrance dying
While its leaves in slumber close
While its (leaves in slumber)
While its leaves in slumber close.

2.
All is hushed and nature's sleeping
With her ev'ning mantle on;
But the rills and brooks are leaping
To (But the rills and brooks are leaping To)
the peaceful night wind's song.
But the rills
(and brooks are leaping
To the peaceful night wind's song...)
and brooks are leaping
To the peaceful night wind's song.
To the (To the peaceful)
To the peaceful night wind's song.

3. (like 1)
Peaceful are the night wind's sighing,
  Dew like angel's tears distills,
Giving life to flowers dying,
  Fragrance to the thirsty hills.

4. (like 2)
Hark! the breeze is now advancing,
  Now 'tis past, forever gone;
See the pearly dew drops dancing
  In the sunbeams of the morn.
