1. Triumphant Victorious Columbia be. 
Her arms still success, still success will command; 
Each Tar on the ocean his conquest enjoys, 
While Laurels, while Laurels shall cover the land. 

[B]
When invaded by foes, that like Locusts arise 
And cry for her ruin, her ruin aloud. 
Thy genious Columbia 
Their fury defies, 
And bursts, and bursts like the Sun, 
like the Sun thro’ a cloud!

REFRAIN and CHORUS sung after [B]
Huzza! Huzza! Huzza! here’s Columbia for ever! 
The Glory, the Glory and pride of the world.

2. How needless to talk of her prowess in war 
or proclaim, or proclaim what the universe knows, 
While they shrink from her vengeance let tyrants declare, 
What it is to have Freemen, to have Freemen for foes!
