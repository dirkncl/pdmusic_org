1. Oh come my boys attention give, 
And a song I’ll sing to you; 
Altho, the story may be old, 
The song you’ll say is new, 
It’s about de Rebolution days 
Which de world did admire; 
When in de hearts of patriots brave 
	Glow’d patriotic [CHORUS:] fire! fire!, fire! 
	Then hurrah for the days of old, 
	Then hurrah for the days of old, 
When ev’ry man and woman too 
	was a hero I’ve been told.

2. Dere was a man among the rest
	And Washington was his name;
And all de folks said he was de best,
	He had such a mighty fame;
He nebber feared de enemy,
	But when odder men would tire:
He wid his continentallers
	Would meet de redcoats [CHORUS:] fire! fire! fire!
	And arunning dey would go,
	And arunning dey would go,
For they thought they’d got a little dose
	Ob de fire down below.

3. Dere’s a place out here called Bunker Hill,
	Whar de monument does stand.
It’s de spot whar Massa Warren fell,
	Afighting for his land;
De Yankees were told to save dere shot
	Till de enemy should git nigher,
And when dey saw de white ob dere eye,
	Dey got de word to [CHORUS:] fire! fire! fire!
	But dey could not beat de foe,
	But dey could not beat de foe,
And many a gallant heart dat day
	Was in de dust laid low.

4. But dere was anudder little hill
	Wat dey call de Dorch’ster Hights,
Whar dey built a fort and cannons sot,
	All in a single night;
When de British General saw de game
	He thought he should suspire,
So he sent an invitation for
	De Yankees to stop dere [CHORUS:] fire! fire! fire!
	But twas no use atalking so,
	It was no use atalking so,
For de Yankees had found a patent way
	To make de redcoats go.
