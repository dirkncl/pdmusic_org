1. My soul within me panting, 
Like a bird within its cage 
’Gainst its prison sadly beating, 
Fill’d with a noble rage.

2. Mysterious thing! what are thou? 
Thou tenant of my breast, 
Thou roamest through thy chambers, 
The ruler yet the guest.

3. I feel thy magic finger 
Laid on this heart of mine. 
A bubbling fount but gushing 
Of exstacy divine.

4. Oft a pleasant tune thou playest 
On the heart’s sweet lute of love. 
And music wings ascending 
My spirit soars above.
