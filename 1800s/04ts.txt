1.
JANE was a Woodman's daughter, 
  The fairest of the three,
Love in his arms had caught her, 
  As fast as fast cou'd be;
A Sailor's Son was HARRY, 
  As brave as brave cou'd be,
And he resolv'd to marry, 
  The fairest of the three,
  The fairest of the three, 
  The fairest of the three,
And he resolv'd to marry, 
  The fairest of the three.

2.
MARIA thought it wiser,
  A rich man's wife to be,
And so took a Miser
  As old as old cou'd be,
LOUISA felt Love's passion,
  But wish'd this world to see
So chose a Lad of Fashion,
  The dullest of the three,
  The dullest of the three,
  The dullest of the three,
So chose a Lad of Fashion,
  The dullest of the three.

3.
LOUISA's spouse perplext her,
  A Widow soon was she,
MARIA's liv'd and vext her
  As well as well cou'd be.
But JANE possest true pleasure
  With one of low degree,
There were each others treasure
  The happiest of the three,
  The happiest of the three,
  The happiest of the three,
There were each others treasure
  The happiest of the three.
