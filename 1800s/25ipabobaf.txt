1. I’ll pull a bunch of buds and flow’rs,
And tie a ribbon round them;
If you’ll but think in your lonely hours,
Of the sweet little girl that bound them.

2. I’ll pull the earliest that put forth,
And those that last the longest,
And the bud that boasts the fairest birth,
Shall cling to the stem that’s strongest.

3. I’ve run about the garden walks
And search’d a mong the dew, Sir;–
These fragrant flowers, these tender stalks,
I’ve gather’d them all for you, Sir.

4. So here’s your bunch of buds and flowers,
And here’s the ribbon round them;
And here, to cheer your lonely hours,
Is the sweet little girl that bound them.
