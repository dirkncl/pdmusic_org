1. Oh! wake thee not dearest, no demon hath start ed, 
To breed upon raven wind o’er thee; 
I’m the spirit polite of a beau that’s departed, 
And linger on earth to adore thee! 
Too tenderly fram’d for this rude world of man, 
And for kindlier regions intended. 
I was slain with a frown, 
And the flirt of a fan,  
And to folly’s Elysium ascended, 
to folly’s Elysium ascended.

2. There fops of all ages are hymning,
The charms of young beauties like you, love;
On wings of white lace from some gay coquettes trimming,
Or cut from her last billetdown, love,
There dance we and sing as softly as Syrens,
But nought from THIS world that’s plebeian,
One only sweet lyric 
Of MOORE’S, or of BYRON’S,
One only Quadrille— “the Psychean!”,
One only Quadrille— “the Psychean!”.

3. And lo! on the moonbeam in silence I slip
From eternity’s region of blisses,
To fan with my pinions thy bosom and lip
Till thy dreams be of sighs and of kisses.
But the pale morn awakes— I must fly love from thee,
Ere her smile in the east she discloses,
To a light dejeunè upon Lavender-tea,
And purified Otto of Roses,
And purified Otto of Roses.
