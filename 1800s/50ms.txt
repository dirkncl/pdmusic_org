1. Far in the woods
Roam I from thee;
Deep in my soul
Cling’st thou to me.
Sound I the horn, love;
Ringeth it by:
It says, “For thee love,
I’d gladly die.”
Sound I the horn, love;
Ringeth it by:
It says, “For thee, love
I’d gladly die.”

2. While the breeze wafts
Its tones o’er the lea,
Think ’tis my soul,
Sighing for thee.
Sound I the horn, love;
Ringeth it by;
It says, “For thee, love,
I’d gladly die.
Sound I the horn, love;
Ringeth it by;
It says, “For thee, love,
I’d gladly die.
