1.
Our Flag is there! Our Flag is there!
  We'll hail it with three loud huzzas!
Our Flag is there; Our Flag is there!
  Behold the glorious Stripes and Stars!
Stout hearts have fought for that bright flag,
  Strong hands sustain'd it mast head high,
And Oh! to see how proud it waves,
  Brings tears of joy in ev'ry eye.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Our Flag is there! Our Flag is there!
  We'll hail it with three loud huzzas!
Our Flag is there! Our Flag is there!
  Behold the glorious Stripes and Stars!

2.
That flag has stood the battle's roar,
  With foemen stout, with foemen brave;
Strong hands have sought that flag to low'r,
  And found a speedy wat'ry grave!
That flag is known on ev'ry shore,
  The standard of a gallant band,
Alike unstain'd in peace or war,
  It floats o'er Freedom's happy land.
