1. De floating scow ob ole Virginia 
Dat I worked from day to day 
A raking 知ong de oyster beds 
To me it was but play. 

[CHORUS]
But now I知 old and feeble too, 
I cannot work any more. 
||: Oh carry me back to ole Virginia, 
To ole Virginia shore. :|| 

2. O, if I was but young again,
I would lead a different life,
And I壇 save money, and buy a farm,
And take Dina for my wife;

[CHORUS]
But now old age, he holds me tight
And my limbs are growing sore,
||: Den carry me back to ole Virginia,
To ole Virginia shore. :||

3. Oh, when I知 dead and gone to rest,
Lay de ole banjo by my side
Let de Possum an de coon to de funeral go,
Fur dey was my only pride;

[CHORUS]
Den in soft repose I take my sleep,
And I値l dream for eber more,
||: Dat carrying back to ole Virginia,
To ole Virginia shore. :||
