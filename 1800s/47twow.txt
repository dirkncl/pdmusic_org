1. The wild old woods I love them well 
For in boyhood’s idle hours 
My heart in  the groves with a magic spell 
Was bound in a wreath of thoughts that tell 
The language sweet of flowers. 

[CHORUS sung twice after each verse]
Where the pearly streams run sparkling on 
With a pleasant melody 
And bathe with spray the mossy rocks 
Aye! the wild old woods for me. 

2. The wild old woods where the shadows cling 
To the greensward fresh with dew 
Where the woodland bird of dusky wing 
Builds her nest on oaks that upward fling 
Their arms to the sky so blue.
