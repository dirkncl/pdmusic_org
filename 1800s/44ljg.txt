1. Oh not for me, oh not for me,
  That fatal toy of gems and gold,
Blood on its ermin’d band I see!
  And thorns are in its silken fold.
Let me the shaded pathway keep,
  Remote from wild ambition’s glare,
Nor lead me to that dizzy steep!
  For clouds and storms  are gath’ring there.

2. In vain they tried each specious art,
  Each sophistry of anxious zeal,
Until the partner of her heart,
  Made to her love a fond appeal.
She yielded then and who can blame
  The youthful lord’s exulting lone,
Which soon the heralds loud acclaim,
  Annouched them heirs of England’s throne. 

3. Dim was their star and short their hoar,
  And weak their friends and fierce their foes,
For captives soon to Mary’s power,
  The towers of Julius round them rose.
She died, that glory of her age!
  As never woman heroine died,
And Briton’s hist’ty has no page,
  More dear to British woman’s pride.
