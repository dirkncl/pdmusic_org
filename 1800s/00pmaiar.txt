How does my Lady’s garden grow? 
How does my Lady’s garden grow 
in silver bells and cockle shells 
and pretty maids all in a row. 
How does my Lady’s garden grow? 
How does my Lady’s garden grow 
with silver bells & cockle shells 
& pretty maids all in a row 
with silver bells & cockle shells 
& pretty maids all in a row.
