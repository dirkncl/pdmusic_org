1. Think not though fate has severed us, 
That I can ere forget 
There’s not a smile, there’s not a word 
But memory treasures yet, 
In vain may science spread her page, 
Her claims are lost to me; 
In festive halls or silent shades, 
Thought flies alone to thee alone, alone, 
thought flies alone to thee, alone, alone 
thought flies alone to thee. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Think not though fate has severed us, 
That I can e’er forget; 
There’s not a smile, there’s not a word, 
But memory treasures yet treasures yet, 
treasures yet, that memory treasures 

2. Oh give me not the blooming wreath, 
To twine around thy hair, 
It would but mock my dreary heart, 
to see its lustre there; 
Nor ask me why no longer beams 
my eye as once it shone, 
I would not have a ray left there 
When ev’ry joy has flown, when ev’ry joy, 
when ev’ry joy has flown, when ev’ry joy, 
when ev’ry joy has flown.
