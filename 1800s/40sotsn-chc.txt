Stars, stars of the summer night, 
Far, far in yon azure deeps 
Hide, hide your golden light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Stars, stars of the summer night, 
Far, far in yon azure deeps 
Hide, hide your golden light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 

Moon, moon of the summer night, 
Far, far down yon western steeps 
Sink, sink in silver light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Sink, sink in silver light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 

Dreams, dreams of the summer night 
Tell, tell her, her lover keeps 
Watch while in slumber light 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps, 
Dreams, dreams of the summer night. 
Tell, tell her, her lover keeps 
Watch while in slumber light 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 

Wind, wind of the summer night, 
Where yonder woodbine creeps, 
Fold, fold thy pinnions light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
Fold, fold thy pinnions light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps, 
She sleeps, she sleeps, my lady sleeps. 
She sleeps, she sleeps, my lady sleeps.
