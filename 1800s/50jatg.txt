1. Pearl River side is far away, 
In Mississippi state, 
Where our old Cabin stands alone, 
With Juney at the Gate; 
I told her I was going away 
But would not stay out late. 
And so she thought I’d soon be home 
And waited at the Gate. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
The Cabin stands upon the stream 
In Mississippi state, 
And I must quickly hurry home 
To take her from the Gate. 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
The  Cabin stands upon the stream 
In Mississippi state, 
And I must quickly hurry home,
To take her from the gate.

2. Old Massa died, and I was sold,
Away in Georgia state;
They did not buy my sister June,
When bought they me her mate;
I could not tell her we must part,
Alas! our cruel fate;
And so, with weeping eyes she stands,
To meet me at the gate!

3. I can’t forget her gloomy look
When I bade her good night,
Nor how my body quak’d and shook,
As slow I left her sight;
But soon, I’ll gold and silver get,
Pray Heav’n! I’m not too late,
To buy my darling Juney free,
And take her from the gate!

4. Ah! Juney was a simple child,
With pretty shining curls,
And white folks lov’d her best of all
The young mullato girls;
’Twas wrong for me to leave her lone,
In Mississippi state,
But money it shall break the chain,
That binds her to the gate!

5. If you should go, away down South,
To Mississippi state,
Don’t fail to seek our cabin there
With Juney at the gate.
Tell her to wait a little while,
Tell her, to hope and wait;
For I am he, shall make her free
And take her from the gate!
