1. Our Ship was out far, far from land, 
When the fairest of our gallant band, 
Grew sadly pale and wan’d away, 
Like the twilight or an autumn day.
We watch’d him thro’ long hours of pain 
But our cares were lost, our hopes were vain.
Death struck he gave no coward alarm, 
For he smiled as he died in his messmate’s arm, 
For he smiled as he died in his messmate’s arm.

2. He had no costly winding sheet, 
But we plac’d a round shot at his feet, 
And he slept in his hammock as safe and sound, 
As a king in his lawnshroud marble bound.
We proudly deck’d his funeral rest 
With the stars and stripes about his breast, 
We gave him those as the badge of the brave, 
And then he was fit for his Sailor’s grave, 
And then he was fit for his Sailor’s grave.

3. Our voices broke our hearts turn’d weak.
Hot tears were seen on the brownest cheek, 
And a quiver played on the lips of pride 
As we lower’d him down the ship’s dark side.
A plunge, a splash and our task was o’er.
The billows rolled as they rolled before 
But many a rude pray’r hallow’d the wave 
That closed above the Sailor’s grave, 
That closed above the Sailor’s grave.
