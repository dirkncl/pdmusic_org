1. Oh tell me how from Love to fly; 
Its dangers how to shun 
To guard the heart, to shield the eye, 
Or I must be undone! 
Or I must be undone! 
Or I must be undone! 
To guard the heart, to shield the eye, 
Or I must be undone. 

2. For thy impression on my mind, 
No time, nor power can move; 
And vain, Alas, the task I find, 
To look and not be love! 
To look and not to love! 
To look and not to love! 
And vain, Alas, the task I find, 
To look and not to love! 

3. Could absence my sad heart uphold, 
I’d hence, and mourn my lot; 
But Mem’ry will not be controll’d, 
Thou ne’er cans’t be forgot. 
Thou ne’er cans’t be forgot. 
Thou ne’er cans’t be forgot. 
But Mem’ry will not be controll’d, 
Thou ne’er cans’t be forgot.
