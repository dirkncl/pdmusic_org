1. I dreamt a bright and glitting star
In lovely radianc shone,
And fondly deemed its gentle rays
Beamed out for me alone.
I lov’d it but too soon I saw
The sky with clouds ov’cast;
And  found in sorrow I hand dreamed,
Of hopes too bright to last.

2. I dreamed a rose in beauty bloomed,
To all admirers free,
But that its soft and balmy breath
Was enly shed for me.
I loved it, but too soon there came
A rude and shiv’ring blast
And taught me I had dreamed again
Of hopes too bright to last.
