1. The Hills of New England!
  How proudly they rise
In the wildness of grand eur
  To blend with the skies!
With their far azure out  line,
  And tall ancient trees—
New England, my country!
  I love thee for these.

2. The Vales of New England!
  That cradle her streams,
And smile in their greenness
  Like land in our dreams:
All sunny with beauty,
  Embomsomed in ease—
New England, my country!
  I love thee for these. 

3. The Woods of New England!
  Still verdant and high,
Though rocked by the tempests
  Of ages gone by—
Romance dims their arches,
  And speaks in the breeze,—
New England, my country!
  I love thee for these. 

4. The Streams of New England!
  That roar as they go;
Or seem, in their stillness,
  But dreaming to flow:
O bright gifts the sunbeam
  Their march to the seas—
New England, my country!
  I love thee for these. 

5. The Homes of New England!
  Free, fortuned and fair;
O many a heart treasures
  Its terraphim there!
E’en more than thy mountains
  Or streamlets they please—
New England, my country!
  I love thee for these. 

6. God shield thee, New England!
  Dear land of my birth!
And thy children that wander
  Afar on the earth,
Thou still art my country,
  Where ’er I am cast;
Take thou to thy bosom
  My ashes at last.
