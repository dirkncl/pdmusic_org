Hail beautious Planet, beautious Planet of the night,
Thrice welcome to my longing sight.
Shine on thou dear shine on thou dear delightful thing,
thou dear delightful thing
And o're the Earth thy radiance fling
Shine on shine on and o're the Earth thy radiance fling.

Hail beautious Planet, beautious Planet of the night,
Thrice welcome to my longing sight.
Shine on thou dear shine on thou dear delightful thing,
thou dear delightful thing
And o're the Earth thy radiance fling
Shine on shine on and o're the Earth thy radiance fling.

(But Ah I see) I see (a fearful cloud) a cloud
thrilling Darkness, Darkness with its shroud, 
Darkness with its shroud, 
Then farewell (Then fare-) pale (well) and (thou)
gentle Moon Since thou and I must part so soon--
Fare---well, fare-well.

[Piu Moto.]
Anon that Cloud will pass away
That Cloud will pass away
(and thou'ht appear in bright array) And (ap-)
thou'ht ap- (-pear) -pear (in) in
bright array and
Thou'ht appear in bright array
Whilst from mine
Eyes tears will not pass,
But hang like dew,
like dew upon the grass;
dew upon the grass.

[Larghetto]
Adieu sweet Moon,
Adeiu sweet Moon
I go to rest,
I go to rest.

[Suave Tempo Primo]
And try to sooth my aching breast
And try to sooth my aching breast,
But vain alass,
But vain alass, I fear
T'will be, alas I fear
T'will be, I fear
T'will be,
For there's no
Comfort here for me, no
Comfort here for me, no
Comfort here for me, for now no
Confort here for me,
Here for me,
Here for me.
