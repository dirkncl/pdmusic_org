1.
I have travell'd this wide world over,
And now to another I'll go,
I know that good quarters are waiting
To welcome old Rosin the beau

CHORUS
To welcome old Rosing the beau...
To welcome old Rosing the beau
I know that good quarters are waiting
To welcome old Rosin the beau

2.
When I'm dead and laid out on the counter,
A voice you will hear from below
Singing some plain whiskey and water
To drink to old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
To drink to old Rosin the beau...
To drink to old Rosin the beau.
Singing some plain whiskey and water
To drink to old Rosin the beau.

3.
And when I'm dead I reckon
The ladies will all want to know
Just lift the lid off of the coffin
And look at old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
And look at old Rosin the beau...
And look at old Rosin the beau
Just lift the lid off of the coffin
And look at old Rosin the beau.

4.
I'll have to be buried I'm thinking
And I would like it done just so
And be sure not to go contrary
To the wish of old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
To the wish of old Rosin the beau...
To the wish of old Rosin the beau
And be sure not to go contrary
To the wish of old Rosin the beau.

5.
You must get some dozen good fellows
And stand them all round in a row
And drink out of half gallon bottles
To the name of old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
To the name of old Rosin the beau...
To the name of old Rosin the beau
And drink out of half gallon bottles
To the name of old Rosin the beau.

6.
Get four or five jovial young fellows
And let them all staggering go
And dig a deep hole in the meadow
And in it toss Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
And in it toss Rosin the beau...
And in it toss Rosin the beau
And dig a deep hole in the meadow
And in it toss Rosin the beau.

7.
Then get you a couple of donecks
Place one at my head and my toe
And do not fail to scratch on it
The name of old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
The name of old Rosin the beau...
The name of old Rosin the beau
And do not fail to scratch on it
The name of old Rosin the beau.

8.
I feel the grim tyrant approaching
That cruel impacable foe,
Who spares neither age or condition
Nor even old Rosin the beau.

CHORUS
Nor even old Rosin the beau...
Nor even old Rosin the beau
Who spares neither age or condition
Nor even old Rosin the beau.

[the original folksong lyrics]

"Rosin the Bow"
Words and music: Anonymous

I've always been cheerful and easy,
  And scarce have I needed a foe.
While some after money run crazy,
  I merrily Rosin'd the Bow.

Some youngsters were panting for fashions,
  Some new kick seemed now all the go,
But having no turbulent passions,
  My motto was "Rosin the Bow."

So kindly my parents besought me,
  No longer a roving to go,
And friends whom I thought had forgot me,
  With gladness met Rosin the Bow.

My young day I spent all in roving,
  But never was vicious, no, no;
But somehow I loved to keep moving,
  And cheerfully Rosin'd the Bow.

In country or city, no matter,
  Too often I never could go,
My presence all sadness would scatter,
  So cheerful was Rosin the Bow.

The old people always grew merry,
  Young faces with pleasure did glow,
While lips with the red of cherry,
  Sipped "bliss to old Rosin the Bow."

While sweetly I played on my viol,
  In measures so soft and so slow,
Old Time stopped the shade on the dial,
  To listen to Rosin the Bow.

And peacefully now I am sinking,
  From all this sweet world can bestow,
But Heaven's kind mercy I'm thinking,
  Provides for old Rosin the Bow.

Now soon some still Sunday morning,
  The first thing the neighbors will know,
Their ears will be met with the warning,
  To bury old Rosin the Bow.

My friends will then so neatly dress me,
  In linen as white as the snow,
And in my new coffin they'll press me,
  And whisper "poor Rosin the Bow."

Then lone with my head on the pillow,
  In peace I'll be sleeping below,
The grass and the breeze shaken willow,
  That waves over Rosin the Bow.
