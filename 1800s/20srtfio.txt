[A]
Soldier rest, the fight is over, 
Rest in peace the battle’s won; 
Sleep untill the morn discover, 
All the deeds that thou hast done, 
Rest in peace, the battle’s won; 
Sleep untill the morn discover, 
All the deeds that thou hast done. 

[B]
Soldier rest thy Mistress dreaming 
now thee in the battle’s fray; 
And her eye with pleasure beaming, 
Mark’d our waving banners gay. 

[REPEAT A]
Soldier rest and let tomorrow, 
Tell of Comrades lost in fight; 
Then shall thou indulge thy sorrow, 
Dream of love and fame tonight. 
Soldier rest and let tomorrow 
Tell of Comrades lost in fight; 
Then shall thou indulge thy sorrow. 
Dream of love and fame tonight. 
Soldier rest, the fight is over, 
Rest in peace, the battle’s won. 
Soon thy Mistress shall discover 
all the deeds that thou hast done. 
Rest in peace, the battle’s won; 
Soon thy Mistress shall discover 
all the deeds that thou hast done. 
deeds that thou hast done. 
that thou hast done, 
That thou hast done, 
that thou hast done.
