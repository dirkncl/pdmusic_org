1.
Goosy, goosy gander, from Bank to Bank I wander 
From City, Globe and Exchange to Gen’ral Int’rest chamber 
There sit the Cashiers the specie they refuse 
There sit the Cashiers the specie they refuse. 
While all the Bank Directors, 
While all the Bank Directors, 
While all the Bank Directors, are clapping on the screws. 

2
Goosy, goosy gander, all around I wander, 
Sawdust and Humbug, in the Doctor’s chamber 
There sits the victim looking rather thin 
There sits the victim looking rather thin. 
Father Longface, 
While old Father Longface, 
While old Father  Longface, pulls the rhino in. 

3.
Goosy, goosy gander, ev’rywhere I wander 
All the folks are gath’ring to Abolition chamber 
There the ’Malgamators are looking mighty wise 
There the Malgamators are looking mighty wise. 
While all the wond’ring Gumbus, 
While all the wond’ring Gumbus, 
While all the wond’ring Gumbus, are rolling up their eyes 

4.
Goosy, Goosy gander, to tented field I wander
Where grunts the Striped Pig, with topers all around her 
See what a laughing crowd is thronging ’round the door 
See what a laughing crowd is thronging ’round the door 
While all the men of water, 
While all the men of water,
While all the men of water, the horrid times deplore.
