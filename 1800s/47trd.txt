1. The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains, and the wind is never weary;
The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,
But at every gust the dead leaves fall,
And the day is dark and dreary.
And the day is derk and dreary.
And the day is dark and dreary.

2. My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains and the wind is never weary;
My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,
But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
And the day is dark and dreary.
And the day is derk and dreary.
And the day is dark and dreary.

3. Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;
Behind the clouds is the sun still shinging;
Thy fate is the common fate of all,
Into each life some rain must fall,
Some days are dark and dreay.
Some days are dark and dreay.
Some days are dark and dreay.
