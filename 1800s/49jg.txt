1. Jalapa gals, your eyes are bright,
Bright as de waking day:
And when you dance, your cheeks do shine,
Just like de flow’rs ob May.

Oh! den come out, and dance wid us,
De gay fandango more,
For we are gwine to march dis night,
For old Kaintucky’s shore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O! den come out and dance wid us,
De gay fandango more,
For we are gwine to march dis night,
For ole Kaintucky’s shore,

2. Jalapa gals your teef are white,
White as de northern snow,
And when you laff dey look jist like,
White sheep plac’d in a row.

Oh! den come our and dance wid us,
De gay fandango more,
For we are gwine to march dis night,
For ole Kaintucky’s shore.

3. Jalapa gals your step is light,
And graceful as de deer,
And when you walk de Plaza round,
We hail you wid tree cheer.

Oh! den come our and dance wid us,
De  gay fandango more,
For we are gwine to march dis night,
For ole Kaintucky’s shore.

4. Jalapa gals, we now must go,
Far far from you away,
But when we reach dear old Kaintuck,
We’ll tink of you alway.

Oh! den come our and dance wid us,
De  gay fandango more,
For we are gwine to march dis night,
For ole Kaintucky’s shore.
