1. Ye Gentlemen of England who live at home at ease, 
Ah! little do you think upon the dangers of the seas; 
Give ear unto the mariners and they will plainly shew, 
All the cares and the fears, 
all the cares and the fears, 
all the cares and the fears, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
while the stormy winds do blow, 
while the stormy winds do blow, 
while the stormy winds do blow, 
while the stormy winds do blow.

2. If enemies oppose us when England is at war,
With any foreign nation we fear not wounds or scars;
Our roaring guns shall teach them our valor for to know,
Whilst they reel on their keel,
whilst they reel on their keel,
whilst they reel on their keel,

[no third verse listed; perhaps an instrumental interlude]
4. Then our courage all brave mariners and never be dismay’d,
Whilst we have bold adventurers we ne’er shall want a trade;
Our merchants will employ us to fetch them wealth we know,
Then be bold work for gold,
then be bold work for gold,
then be bold work for gold,
