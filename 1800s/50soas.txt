1. O! quickly lend the pliant oar
But soft but soft let no one hear
I would not court the curious gaze
Of many an idle loit’rer there
I only wish One eye to see
That one which fondly looks for me.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
La la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la la la la

2. O had the midnight heav’n a tongue,
As it has burning eyes above
Full many a wond’rous tale ’twould tell
Of happy and despairing love
Of many a one who roves like me
With beating heart on Adria’s sea.

3. The lights have faded one by one
O turn the brow towards the shore.
The meeting hour is almost come;
My  anxious heart can wait no more
For in yon balcony above
I see my timid gentle love.
