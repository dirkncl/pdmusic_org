1. Oh come with me to my little canoe,
Where the sea is calm and the sky is blue,
Oh! come with me for I long to go
To those Isles where the mango apples grow,
Oh! come with me and be my love,
For thee the jungle depth I値l rove,
I値l gather the honey comb bright as gold,
And chase the Elk to its secret hole.

[CHORUS sung twice after each VERSE]
I値l chase the Antelope over the plain,
The Tiger cub I値l bind with a chain,
And the wild Gazelle with its silvery feet
I値l give thee for a playmate sweet.

2. I値l climb the palm for the Bias nest,
Red peas I値l gather to deck they breast
I値l pierce the cocoa痴 cup for its wine,
And haste to thee if thou値t be mine,
Then come with me in my light canoe,
While the sea is calm and the sky is blue,
For should we linger another day
Storms may arise and love decay.

3. Oh come if the love thou hast for me,
Is pure and fresh as mine for thee,
Fresh as the fountain under ground,
When first 稚is by the Lapwing found
Our sands are bare and down their slope
The silvery footed Antelope,
As gracefully and gaily springs
As o弾r the marbled sourts of kings.
