1.
Deserted by the waning moon,
When skies proclaimed night's cheerless noon,
on Tower Fort or tended ground,
the Sentry walk's his lowly round,
the Sentry walk's his lowly round,
the Sentry walk's his lowly round,
and should a footstep haply stray
where caution marks the guarded way,
where caution marks the guarded way,
the guarded way, who goes there
Stranger quickly tell, a Friend
the Word good night all's well
all's well the word good night all, all's well.

2.
Or Sailing on the midnight deep,
while weary messmates soundly sleep,
the careful watch patrols the Deck,
to guard the Ship from Foes or wreck,
to guard the Ship, from Foes or wreck,
to guard the Ship, from Foes or wreck,
while his thoughts oft homeward veer,
some friendly voice salutes his ear,
some well known voice salutes his ear,
an lures his ear, what cheer
Brother quickly tell, above below
good night all's well all's well,
a-bove be-low all all's well.
