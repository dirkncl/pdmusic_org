1.
When I live’d way down in ole Virginia 
I bought a culored gal for a guinea 
  By de [unavailable from source] 
  cause your heart to palpitate gib up de ghost and die;
Den I warn all you darkies not to lub her;
If you do she will cause you to blubber;
  So get out ob de way 
  and remember what I say, 
  Ise a gwain to marry her myself 
  some berry fine day.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Den I warn all you darkies not to lub her, 
If you do she will cause you to blubber;
So get out ob de way and remember what I say 
Ise a gwain to marry her myself some berry fine day!

2.
But now she’s goin for to leave me,
If she does will cruelly deceive me;
  But to win her I will try,
  By de winking of de eye,
  If she dont consent to marry
  I will go away and cry.
But I know dat she will not deceive me;
And she is not a gwoin for to leave me;
  So to hab a little fun,
  For de Banjo I will run,
  And I’ll play dat merry tune,
  ’Jenny git you hoe cake done.’

3.
One night when de moon war a beaming,
I lay fast asleep a dreaming,
  Dat de sun war shining bright,
  In de middle ob de night,
  And de Darkies had collected,
  For to hab a little fight.
When I woke, oh, de Banjo war sounding,
De Bones through de air war a bounding,
  But how pleasant it did seem,
  I was married in a dream
  In de floating scow Virginia,
  On de Mississippi stream.
