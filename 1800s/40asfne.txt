"[A] Song for New England" (1840)
Written by H. W. Elsworth Esq.

Let it rise, till it meet the sun in his coming. Let the
earliest light of the morning guide it, and parting day
linger and play on its summit. -- Webster

[Recitative]
Bright Eden— land of Nations,
Proud home of Liberty,
Joy be upon thy mountains,
And peace amid thy vales;
My Fatherland New England.

1. New England, New England!
How beautiful thy vales;
Where summer flow’rs, are breathing forth,
Their sweets to summer gales;
Where soft the wild note breaketh,
From out each dewy grove,
Where long the nightbird chanteth
Her even lay of love.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
New England, New England,
How beautiful thy vales,
Where summer flow’rs are breathing forth,
Their sweets to summer gales.
Their sweets to summer gales.
Their sweets to summer gales.

2. Oh! far beyond the surges wild,
That beat upon thy shore,
Hath swept the Paeen of thy fame
Old ocean’s vastness o’er!
And echoes far the triumph song,
Of that true hearted band,
Who gave their homes, their all for God,
And thee my fatherland!

3. It peals amid the palaces,
Of England’s titled sons.
O’er soft Italia’s quivering wires,
Its magic music runs;
From lofty peak, and lovely vale,
From Islands of the sea,
In joyous notes, comes bursting forth,
That anthem of the free!

4. Thy sons, what clime that knoweth not,
The noble and the brave!
The tamers of the stubborn earth,
The rovers of the wave.
Aye! dearly do they love the land,
Their fathers died to gain,
Their pride its glory fresh to keep,
Its honour bright from stain!

5. New England! New England!
God’s blessing on thee be;
And ever on those cherish’d ones,
Fond mem’ry links with thee,
From this fair land, whose spreading skies
Like thine a glory wear,
My spirit turns to breath for thee,
A blessing and a prayer.
