1. ’Tis the last rose of summer 
Left blooming alone, 
All her lovely companions 
Are faded and gone! 
No flower of her kindred, 
No rosebud is nigh 
To reflect back her blushes, 
Or give sigh for sigh.

2. I’ll not leave thee, thou lone one, 
To pine on the stem; 
Since the lovely are sleeping, 
Go, sleep thou with them: 
Thus kindly I scatter 
Thy leaves o’er the bed 
Where thy mates of the garden 
Lie scentless and dead.

3. So soon may I follow, 
When friendships decay, 
And from love’s shining circle, 
The gems drop away, 
When true hearts lie wither’d, 
And fond ones are flown, 
Oh! who would inhabit 
This bleak world alone.
