1. To me the world’s an open book,
Of sweet and pleasant poetry,
I read it on the running brook,
That sings its way towards the sea.
It whispers in the leaves of trees,
The swelling grain, the waving grass,
And in the cool fresh evening breeze,
That crisps the wavelets as they pass.

2. The flow’rs below— the stars above—
In all their bloom and brightness giv’n,
Are like the attributes of love,
The poetry of Earth and Heav’n.
Thus nature’s volume read aright,
Attunes the soul to minstrelsy,
Tinging life’s clouds with rosy light,
And all the world with poetry.
