As a sensitive coon lay sleeping one day,
The sound of the wood cutter’s hatchet was heard,
So he jump’d on a stump to see what was to pay,
And thus did he sing, aye, he sang like a bird:—

Woodman spare that tree.
Touch not a single bough;
In youth it shelter’d me.
And I’ll stick to it now.

Hard by on a pine sat a sober old owl,
A fanning himself with the cool western breeze,
And he wore on his features a horrible scowl,
As he sang to the zephyrs that play’d thro’ the trees,
As he sang to the sephyrs that play’d thro’ the trees:—

Blow away ye gentle breezes
All among the leaves and treeses,
I’ll sit down among the muses
Then I’ll mend my boots and shoeses.

A Squirriel and Possum together then met,
And shook hands and kiss’d and most lovingly clung,
For they vow’d years ago that they ne’er would forget
One another thro’ life—
So they struck up and sung:—

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never bro’t to mind—
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?

A Fox jump’d out of his thicket and play’d
With his brush for a while in a transport of glee;

Then thoughtfully walk’d to a green forest glade,
And sat himself down and most sweetly sang he—

Oft in the stilly night,
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me
Fond mem’ry brings the sight,
Of nice fat geese around me!

Then the Owl, Squirrel, Possum, the Fox and the Coon,
In concert all join’d to the tune of “Moll Brooks,”
And the stars cried Encore,
And the bright silv’ry moon
Grew brighter and brighter
as they sang, as they sang without books,
as they sang without books.

[CHORUS]
We won’t go home till morning
We won’t go home till morning
We won’t go home till morning
Till daylight doth appear;
We won’t go home till morning
We won’t go home till morning
We won’t go home till morning
Till daylight doth appear.
