1. Ye banks, and braes, and streams around 
The castle of Montgomery, 
Green by your woods, and fair your flow’rs 
Your waters never drumlie!
There simmer first unfold her robes, 
And there she langest tarry;
For there I took the last farewell 
Of my sweet Highland MARY.

2. How sweetly bloom’d the gaygreen birk,
How rich the hawthorn’s blossom,
As underneath their fragrant shade,
I clasp’d her to my bosom!
The golden hours, on angel wings,
Flew o’er me and my desires
For dear to me as light and life,
Was my sweet Highland MARY.

3. Wi’ mony a vow, and lock’d embrace,
Our parting was fo’tender;
And pledging aft to meet again,
We tore ourselves asunder.
But oh! fell death’s untimely frost,
That nipt my flower sae early!
Now green’s the sod, and cauld’s the clay
That wraps my Highland MARY.

4. O pale, pale now, those rosy lips
I aft ha’e kiss’d sae fondly!
And clos’d for ay, the sparkling glance
That dwelt on me sae kindly!
And mouldering now in silent dust,
That heart that lo’ed me dearly!
But still within my bosom’s core
Shall live my Highland MARY.
