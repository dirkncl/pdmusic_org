1. I lov’d my Pheobe verry well, I lov’d her night and day.
I lov’d her while I hoed de corn, and while I mow’d de hay.
At night when all my work was done I sought my Phoebe’s cot
And while she led de hoe down dance I scrap’d de old cat gut.

[REFRAIN and] CHORUS [sung after each VERSE [i.e. twice]]
O Phoebe she was lovely as de flow’rs upon the lea.
Her smile was like de dancing light upon de summer’s sea.

2. But Massa sole me far away, I cried to break my heart,
When I to Florida must go, and with my Phoebe part.
In cotten fields I labour’d hard— my Massa berry kind,
I felt no care or sorrow, but, for her I left behind.

3. One day my Massa’s little boy, upon de ribers side,
While sporting with his tiney boat fell in its rapid tide;
His Mother’s piercing scream I heard— I stop’d to hear no more
But plunging in I cotch’d de child and fotch him to de shore.

4. Den she fell upon my neck and joy was in her eye
This change from grief to frantic bliss; made dis poor nigger cry.
My Massa guve me freedom and I sot out for home
To meet my dearest— Phoebe, and neber more to roam.

5. But when I did come dar— to de spot whar I was born,
Dar was a tear in ebry eye, and de place it was forlorn;
I axed whar my Phoebe was, da nigger shook his  head,
And, busting out a crying, said, poor Phoebe was— gone dead.

6. Dar was ashes in dis heart, when I stood by Phoebe’s grave.
And many abitter tear fell down, the dreary sod to lave.
I lef de home I lov’d so well, I could not bear de sight,
And dat’s de reason why you see dis nigger hear to night.
