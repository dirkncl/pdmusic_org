1. Day has gone, and night has come, 
And we niggers take our rest, 
Ob all the gals dat come dis way. 
Julianna suits me best; 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den Julianna Johnson dont you cry. 
Ise gwan away for to leabe you. 
Wait a little while I’ll come byne bye, 
Dont you let my parting grieve you.

2. Julianna she is berry tall, 
She’s slender bout dat waist, 
She’s got such a pair ob lubly lips.
How I long for dem to taste.

3. I took Julianna from her home,
And we trabbled cross dem fields.
She got fast in a ditch & couldn’t get out
For de largeness ob dem heels.

4. Julianna she is de royal blood
To de great Victoria Anna;
And I was her belobed lobe,
Case I play’d on dis piana.

5. De railroad is mighty swift—
But de niggers legs is swifter;
And I’ll go down to old birviny,
And marry pop Miller’s sister.

6. Pop Miller’s daughter sent me word,
And seal’d it in a letter.
She said “my lub she’d nebber be.”
And it broke my heart for eber.
