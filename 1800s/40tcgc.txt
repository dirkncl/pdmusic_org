1. Come let us meet when day light sets, 
Grimalkin he can bawl; 
Thou slick skinn’d Tom Cat, Prince of pets, 
Can teach us how to squall; 
	Thou slick skinn’d Tom Cat, Prince of pets, 
	Can teach us how  to squall.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We’ll sing in harmony a glee, 
Meough, meough, meough. 
This in the Cat’s first Jubilee, 
Meough, meough, meough, 
	meough, meough, meough, 
	meough,  meough, meough.

2. Well give a fist rate concert now,
Grimalkin take the lead;
Dont let them Tom Cats make a row,
Our harmony impede.
	Dont let them Tom Cats make a row,
	Our harmony impede.

3. For now’s the hour for loving Cats,
In harmony to meet;
Secure from noisy dogs and rats,
Let each Cat take her seat.
	Secure from noisy dogs and rats,
	Let each Cat take her seat.

4. Grimalkin hear our dullest squall,
That rolls along in piles;
It takes us young Cats, thus to bawl.
The old ones they may smile.
	It takes us young Cats, thus to bawl.
	The old ones they may smile.

5. That Cat there sings quite out of tune,
Grimalkin close her jaws.
We have no place for such a lune,
Nor those with dirty paws.
	We have no place for such a lune,
	Nor those with dirty paws.

6. But oh Grimalkin should they still,
Not mind their P’s and Q’s;
Expell them from the place they fill,
And let them take a snooze.
	Expell them from the place they fill,
	And let them take a snooze.

7. In chorus let us all conclude,
To finish this night’s sport;
Let’s swell our notes in magnitude,
Till we begin to snort.
	Let’s swell our notes in magnitude,
	Till we begin to snort.
