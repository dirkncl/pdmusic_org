1.
Old Ironsides at anchor lay
  In the harbor of Mahon;
A dead calm rested on the bay.
  The waves to sleep had gone;
When little Jack the captain's son,
  With gallant hardihood
Climb'd deck and spar then upon
  The maintruck rose and stood.

2.
A shudder ran through ev'ry vein,
  All eyes were turn'd on high,
There stood the boy with dizzy brain,
  Between the sea and sky.
No hold had he above-- below--
  Alone he stood in air,
At that far height none dar'd to go,
  No aid could reach hime there!

3.
We gaz'd, but not a man could speak,
  With horror all aghast.
In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,
  We watch'd the quiv'ring mast;
The atmosphere grew thick and hot,
  And of a lurid hue,
As, riveted unto the spot,
  Stood officers and crew.

4.
The father came on deck-- he gasp'd.
  "0h God! thy will be done!"
Then suddenly a rifle grasp'd
  And aim'd it at his son;
"Jump far out, boy! into the wave!
  Jump, or I fire!" he said:
"That only chance your life can save!
  Jump, jump boy!"-- He obey'd.

5.
He sank, he rose, he liv'd, he mov'd,
  He for the ship struck out!
On board we hail'd the lad belov'd,
  With many a manly shout;
His father drew in silent joy
  Those wet arms round his neck,
Then folded to his heart the boy,
  And fainted on the deck!
