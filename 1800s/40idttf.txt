1. They have torn us apart but by those angel eyes 
And the sweet glance they gave when first we met 
By our first pledge so fond yet so unwise 
That still must cheer me when all hope has set 
By my fond pray’rs and by they free replies 
By each dear memory freshly cherish’d yet 
Thy gentle murmurs and thy plaintive sighs 
I dare thee I defy thee to forget 
  I dare thee I defy thee to forget.

2. By all we both remember of the past,
When thy young beating heart with mine first met;
By that warm kiss, the dearest and the last,
Whose sweetness on my lips is lingering yet,
By thy free vow to dare with me the blast,
Nor in the world’s frown suffer one regret;
By all the love thou gav’st me & still hast,
My heart defies thine ever to forget
  My heart defies thine ever to forget.

3. Thou still must love me on, through weal and woe
Howe’er the wall between us has been set;
They cannot teach thy bosom not to know;
’Tis now, with parting only, comes regret.
Thou knowest I love thee, and thine eyes will flow,
To think how mine must ever more be wet;
By these I triumph, these defeat the blow,
These dare thee— these defy thee to forget.
  These dare thee— these defy thee to forget.
