"The 'Old Granite State'" (1843)
by John Hutchinson, 1821-1908

1.
We have come from the mountains,
We have come from the mountains,
We have come from the mountains,
  Of the "Old Granite State."
We're a band of brothers,
We're a band of brothers,
We're a band of brothers,
  And we live among the hills,
With a band of music,
With a band of music,
With a band of music,
  We are passing round the World.

2.
We have left our aged parents,
We have left our aged parents,
We have left our aged parents,
  In the "Old Granite State."
We obtain'd their blessing,
We obtain'd their blessing,
We obtain'd their blessing,
  And we bless them in return,
Good old fashion'd singers,
Good old fashion'd singers,
Good old fashion'd singers,
  They can make the air resound.

CHORUS [after every two verses only]
Hurrah! hurrah!, hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah!, hurrah!
Like our sires before us,
We will swell the chorus,
'Till the heavens o'er us,
shall rebound the loud huzzah.

3.
We have eight other Brothers,
And of Sisters, just another,
Besides our Father, and our Mother,
  In the "Old Granite State"
With our present number,
With our present number,
With our present number,
  There are fifteen in the tribe;
Thirteen sons and daughters,
Thirteen sons and daughters,
Thirteen sons and daughters,
  And their history we bring.

4.
Yes while the air is ringing
With their wild mountain singing,
We the news to you are bringing,
  From the "Old Granite State."
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
  'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
'Tis the tribe of Jesse,
  'Tis the tribe of Jesse,

(CHORUS)

Caleb, Joshua, Jesse, and Beny, (jamin)
Judson, Rhoda, John, and Asa,
  And Abbe, are our names:
We're the sons of Mary,
We're the sons of Mary,
We're the sons of Mary,
  Of the tribe of Jesse,
And we now address ye,
And we now address ye,
And we now address ye,
  With our native mountain song.

6.
We are all real Yankees,
We are all real Yankees,
We are all real Yankees,
  From the "Old Granite State"
And by prudent guessing,
And by prudent guessing,
And by prudent guessing,
  And by prudent guessing,
And by prudent guessing,
And by prudent guessing,
And by prudent guessing,
  We shall whittle through the world.

(CHORUS)

Equal liberty is our motto
  In the "Old Granite State"
We despise oppression

  And we cannot be enslaved.
We despise oppression

We despise oppression
  And we cannot be enslaved.

8.
Yes we'er friends of emancipation
And we'el sing the proclamation
Till it echoes through our nation
  From the "Old Granite State"
That the tribe of Jesse
That the tribe of Jesse
That the tribe of Jesse
  Are the friends of equal rights.
That the tribe of Jesse
That the tribe of Jesse
That the tribe of Jesse
  Are the friends of equal rights.

We are all Washingtonians,
Yes we're all Washingtonians,
Heav'n bless the Washingtonians,
  Of the "Old Granite State"
We are all teetoatlers,

We are all teetoatlers,
  And have sign'd the Temp'rance pledge.
We are all teetoatlers,
We are all teetoatlers,

  And have sign'd the Temp'rance pledge.

10.
Now three cheers altogether,
Shout Columbia's people ever,
Yankee hearts none can sever,
  In the "Old Sister States."
Like our Sires before us,
Like our Sires before us,
Like our Sires before us,
  We will swell the chorus,
'Till the Heavens o'er us,
'Till the Heavens o'er us,
'Till the Heavens o'er us,
   Shall rebound the loud hussa.

(CHORUS)
