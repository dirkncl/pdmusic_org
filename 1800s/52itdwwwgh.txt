1. In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn! 
We never had such times, or saw 
  Such sights since we were born. 
We danc’d and sung and laugh’d and play’d, 
  With hearts so light and free. 
The sky above our canopy; 
  Our field the raging sea. 
And thus we whil’d away the hours, 
  Of ev’ry night and morn; 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn! 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn!

2. The homesick ones bemoan’d the time,
  They ever went to sea;
The seasick ones, they fed the sharks!
  With true philanthropy!
The sober ones, they moved about,
  With slow and solemn tred.
The gay ones skipp’d with hearts so light.
  The lazy went to bed!
And thus we whil’d away the hours, 
  Of ev’ry night and morn; 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn! 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn!

3. We saw such lots of Porpoises!
  And Flying-fish a heap;
Dolphins, Albatross, besides
  Great monsters of the deep;
And when we were upon the Line,
  Old Neptune came on board,
Victims were dous’d and slush’d and scrap’d,
  When ere he gave the word.
And thus we whil’d away the hours, 
  Of ev’ry night and morn; 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn! 
In the days when we went Gold-hunting! 
  ’Twas all around the Horn!

4. But a grander sight, more splendid far,
  We saw when off “the Cape.”
The wind it blew, the hail it flew,
  Both “Canister and Grape.”
The angry sea ran mountains high,
  And swept us “fore and aft,”
And seem’d intent on swallowing
  Our poor devoted Craft.
The rains did pour, the winds did rant there!
  Every night and morn;
Oh! then we saw the Elephant there!
  All around the Horn!
Oh! then we saw the Elephant there!
  All around the Horn!
