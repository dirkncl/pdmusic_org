1. The good old state, the brave old state,
  Where granite rocks abound,
Where rushing streams from mountains great
  Throw sweetest murmurs round;
[CHORUS]
In thee we leave our mountain home
  While kind remembrance thrills,
Each heart and mind for kindred kind
  Among the ganite hills.

2. By steam and lake, by stream and lake,
  Beside the wild cascade
Where cataracts their echoes wake
  Or ’neath some forest shade,
[CHORUS]
We’ve left again our mountain home
  While kind remembrance thrills
Each heart and mind, for kindred kind,
  Among the granite hills.

3. Through milder climes, through milder climes,
  And richer lands we roam,
Where merry music sweetly chimes
  From many a happy home.
[CHORUS]
Then think of those we’ve left behind
  While kind remembrance thrills,
Each heart and mind for kindred kind
  Among the granite hills.
