1. The sweet church bells are pealing out
  A chorus wild and free,
And every thing rejoicing
  For the glorious victory;
But bitter tears are gushing
  For the gallant and the gay,
Who now in death are sleeping
  On the field of Monterey.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
On the field of Monterey,
Who now in death are sleeping
On the field of Monterey. 

2. When spring was here with opening flowers
  And I the proud May queen,
And all the young and gay were met
  To dance upon the green;
The noblest and the manliest
  Was by my side that day,
Who now in death is sleeping
  On the field of Monterey.

3. The flowers of spring are faded now.
  The woods are sear and cold,
The persimmon’s cheek is flushing
  And the papaw shines in gold.
But he in earliest manhood
  Had sadly passed away,
And now in death is sleeping
  On the field of Monterey.

4. The bugles swell their wildest notes
  And loud the cannons roar,
And madly peal the sweet church bells
  For holy rest no more;
But lonely hearts are bleeding
  Upon this glorious day,
For the loved in death are sleeping
  On the field of Monterey.
