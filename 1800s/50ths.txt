Come hither, come hither my pretty herd
  Huah! huah!
  Huah! huah! huah!
Come Ox and Cow, and weanling brood
And hasten to taste of the ev’ning food
For night with her shade, creeps dark’ning on
Ring shrilly horn on the mountain round
And follow my cattle the welcome sound
  Huah! huah! huah!
To grateful abundance my flock,
Now speed ye.
Paradis’d upon her arm,
No care can grieve no ill can harm.
  Paradis’d upon her arm,
  No care can grieve no ill can harm.

Come hither, come hither my pretty herd
Huah! huah! huah! haah! haah!
Huah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!
