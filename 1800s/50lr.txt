1. Little Rose is full of mischief, 
Laughing all the live long day;
Merry as a chirping cricket 
That ’mid flowers loves to stray 
Ringlets floating round her forehead, 
Give her such a dreamy air;
Lips that seem to my just parted, 
Come and kiss me if you dare, 
Lips that seem to say you parted, 
Come and kiss me if you dare.

2.
Little Rose is fresh and blooming,
How ideal is her form;
Gentle, kind, and full of goodness,
And a heart that’s fresh and warm.
Then her voice, so sweet and winsome—
O! it is some fairy dream!
Tones like silver linger round me,
Like the music of a stream.
Tones like silver linger round me,
Like the music of a stream.

3. Little Rose lives in a cottage,
All embowered in a dell;
Front of white and wall of woodbine,
Where the linnets love to dwell.
Here mid beauty, Rose is happy,
Sunshine, flowers, leaves of green;
Revelling in pomp of nature,
One more happy ne’er was seen.
Revelling in pomp of nature,
One more happy ne’er was seen.
