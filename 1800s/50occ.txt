1. Our coral caves beneath the sea
Are laying many fathoms deep,
And in their sparry halls of light
The spirits of the ocean, the spirits of the ocean,
the spirits of the ocean sleep
Until the moonbeam’s fairy ray
Illumines ev’ry sylphic eye,
And starlight tells us that the day
Is fading from the silent sky.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE] 
Then dwell with me, dwell with me, dwell with me,
Oh dwell with me, dwell with me,
Oh dwell with me, dwell Oh dwell with me,
Dwell, dwell with me,
Dwell, dwell with me.

2. The lovely rose blooms not for us
Or violets shed their fragrant breath,
Yet we have spars and brilliant gems
That share their beauty, that share their beauty, 
that share their beauty, not their death:
Oh transient are the joys of earth
Compar’d with these beneath the wave,
And Death follows ever on their birth,
Ere love cannot its Idol save.
