1.
What can it be that makes me sad,
  When thinking of the past,
That was so bright and beautiful,
  Alas too bright to last,
The spring has come with all its bloom,
  The Azure sky is clear;
But not one throb beats for me there
  in the heart I lov'd so dear!
But not one throb beats for me there
  in the heart I lov'd so dear!

2.
Why do the flowers blossom forth,
  Birds sing their tuneful lay,
Whilst winter with its icy chain,
  O'er me still holds its sway.
I care no for the bright eyes;
  That once my soul did cheer,
For not one throb beats for me there!
  In the heart I lov'd so dear,
For not one throb beats for me there!
  In the heart I lov'd so dear.
