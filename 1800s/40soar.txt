1.
As I walk'd out by de light ob de moon,
So merrily singing dis same tune,
I cum across a big racoon, 
  A sittin' on a rail, sittin' on a rail,
  sittin' on a rail, sittin' on a rail,
Sleepin werry sound.

2.
I at de Racoon take a peep,
An den so softly to him creep,
I foun de Raccon fast asleep,
  An pull him off de rail, pull him off de rail,
  pull him off de rail, pull him off de rail,
An fling him on de ground.

3.
De Racoon gan to scratch and bite,
I hit him once wid all myu might,
I bung he eye, an spile he sight,
  O I'm dat child to fight, I'm dat child to fight,
  I'm dat child to fight, I'm dat child to fight,
And beat de banjo too.

4.
I tell de Racoon gin to pray,
While on de ground de Racoon lay,
But he jump up, and ran away,
  An soon he out ob sight, soon he out ob sight,
  soon he out ob sight, soon he out ob sight,
Sittin on a rail.

5.
My ole Massa dead an gone,
A dose ob poisin help him on,
De Debil say he funeral song,
  Oh bress him, let him go, bress him, let him go,
  bress him, let him go, bress him, let him go,
An joy go wid him too.

6.
De Racoon hunt do werry quare,
Am no touch to kill de deer,
Be Case you kotch him wid out fear,
  Sittin on a rail, sittin on a rail,
  sittin on a rail, sittin on a rail,
Sleepin werry sound.

7.
Ob all de songs dat eber I sung,
De Racoon hunt's de greatest one,
It always pleases old and young,
  And den dey cry encore, den dey cry encore,
  den dey cry encore, den dey cry encore,
An den I come agin.
