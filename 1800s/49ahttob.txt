1. Fill fill the sparkling brimmer!
Fill! for the moments fly:
The stars’ weary light grows dimmer,
And the moon fades away from the sky.
Fill! fro the signal flag is up!
And the wind is veering round
In haste let us pledge our parting cup
In a health to the outward bound.
  In haste let us pledge our parting cup
  In a health to the outward bound.

2. Fill high this hour tomorrow
Nor toast nor jest shall be,
But a few shall meet in sorrow,
While the many plough the sea.
Then while we’re all together,
Give the toast let it
Full sails and prosperous weather
And a health to the outward bound.
  Full sails and prosperous weather
  And a health to the outward bound.

3. Let no adieu be spoken
To weep is a woman’s part;
Nor give me a farewell token
But a health from our inmost heart:
Oft when the winds blow free,
And the rough waves roll around
The health shall come back to thee
That we drand to the outward bound.
  The health shall come back to thee
  That we drand to the outward bound.
