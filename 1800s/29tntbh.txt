"There's Nothing True But Heaven" (1829)
From Moore's Sacred Melodies.
Words by Thomas Moore, 1779-1852
Music by Oliver Shaw, 1779-1848

1.
The world is all a fleeting show, for man's illusion giv'n;
  The world is all a fleeting show, for man's illusion giv'n;
The smiles of joy, the tears of woe, 
Deceitful shine, deceitful flow,

[REFRAIN]
There's nothing true, but heav'n,
There's nothing true, but heav'n,
There's nothing true, but heav'n!

2.
And false the light on glory's plume, as fading hues of even;
  And false the light on glory's plume, as fading hues of even;
And love, and hope, and beauty's bloom
Are blossoms gather'd for the tomb ...

REFRAIN
There's nothing bright but heav'n,
There's nothing bright but heav'n,
There's nothing bright but heav'n!

3.
Poor wand'rers of a stormy day, from wave to wave we're driv'n;
  Poor wand'rers of a stormy day, from wave to wave we're driv'n;
And fancy's flash, and reason's ray,
Serve but to light the troubled way ...

REFRAIN
There's nothing calm but heav'n,
There's nothing calm but heav'n,
There's nothing calm but heav'n!
