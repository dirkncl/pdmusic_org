1.
Oh now I come afore you,
  To sing a little song
And play de tum tum Bongo,
  Bout luby Lucy Long,
Oh! none's so fair as Lucy.
Dat sweet Lucy Long,
Oh none's so fair as Lucy,
Dat Lucy, Miss Lucy Long.

2.
Miss Lucy's berry saucy,
  Whene'er I talk ob lub --
You'd tink her eyes were comets --
  Dey're as big as a washing tub
So lubly as dat Lucy --
Miss Lucy Miss Lucy Long.

3.
Her face, all black sad shiny,
  Is smooth as de skins ob soles;
Her figure is so charming,
  Just like a great sack ob coals.
Ob none's so fair as Lucy,
Dat Lucy, Miss Lucy Long.

4.
When last she went a dancing
  She trod de floor as light
Dat all de Niggers jump up
  And run off in a fright.
Oh! sweet enchanting Lucy,
Dat Lucy, Miss Lucy Long.

5.
And when dat we are married,
  As sure as she was born,
If she turn out a wixen,
  I'll trade her away for corn,
And nebber again see Lucy,
  Dat Lucy, Miss Lucy Long.

Oh! I jis come out afore you,
To sing a little song;

And dey calls it Lucy Long.
Oh!

CHORUS

And Miss Lucy she is tall;
To see her dance Cachucha,
Is death to Niggers all.

Just like an ear ob corn;
And her eyes dey look so winning!
Oh! would I'd ne'er been born.

Myself de toder day;
She said she'd rather tarry,
So I let her habe her way.

If she makes a scolding wife,
As sure as she was born,
I'll tote her down to Georgia,
And trade her off for corn.
Then

(CHORUS)
