1. O l lub Susan dearly,
  I’ve lub’d her many a day,
And I shall lub her always
  ’Till all my head am gray.

[CHORUS sung twice after each VERSE]
Susan dear Susan dear
Wont you show some lub for me
Susan dear Susan dear
Show some lub for me.

2. It was by de Chesapeake
  Dat fust I saw my Sue,
My heart war gone dat minute
  And I sang as now to you.

3. Her hair was dark and frizzly,
  Her eye it looked me thro’,
You nebber saw so sweet a smile,
  As gabe by lubly Sue.

4. I helpd her hoe de baccer,
  What all you white men chew
And as we worked togeder
   Twas so I courted Sue.

5. But massa cotched me winkin
  He said it would not do
Dat lub am all a humbug
  But still I say to Sue.

6. Each night I took my banjo,
  And to my cabin flew
And all de night I sing a song
  About my dearest Sue.

7. But Susan was so cruel
  Oh, dis am sartin true,
She hurt my feelings berry much
  And make em black and blue.

8. But dis she wont return me
  De lub for her I bring
She smash dat same ole banjo,
  If I dont forebber sing.

9. For I lub Susan dearly
  I lub her all de day,
And tho she am so cruel
  I’ll lub her till I’m gray.
