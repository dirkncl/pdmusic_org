1.
When I ilb'd in Tennesse,
Uliali olae,
I went courtin Rosa Lee,
Uliali olae,
Eyes as dark as winter night,
Lips as red as berrys;
When first I did her wooing go,
She said, "now don't be foolish, Joe."

CHORUS
Uliali olae,
Courtin' down in Tennesse,
Uliali olae,
'Neath de wild Banana tree.

2.
I said you lubbly Gal, dat's plain,
Uliali olae,
Brett as sweet as sugar cane,
Uliali olae,
Feet so large and comely too,
Might make a cradle of each shoe;
Rosa, take me for your beau,
She said, "now don't be foolish, Joe."

(CHORUS)

3.
My story yet is to be bold,
Uliali olae,
Rosa cotch'd a shocking cold,
Uliali olae,
Send de Doctor, fetch de Nurse,
Doctor came, but made her worse,
I tried to make her laugh, but no---
She said, "now don't be foolish, Joe."

(CHORUS)

4.
Day give her up, no pow'r could save,
Uliali olae,
She ax me follow to her grave,
Uliali olae,
I take her hand, 'twas cold as death,
So cold I hardly draw my breff,
She saw my tears in sorrow flow,
And said, "now don't be foolish, Joe."

(CHORUS)
