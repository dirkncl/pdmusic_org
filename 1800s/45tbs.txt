1. Our notions rightly kettled up
  No one a doubt can harbour
That all the world’s a Barber’s shop,
  And ev’ry man a Barber,
    And ev’ry man a Barber,
    And ev’ry man a Barber,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, And ev’ry man a Barber.

2. The farmer, he’s a Barber’s friend,
  And ready to a trice, sir,
To lather with a recommend,
  And shave us with a price, sir.
    And shave us with a price, sir,
    And shave us with a price, sir,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, And share us with a price, sir.

3. Mechanic’s they are Barber’s all,
  Nor lackey at their play, sir,
They lather when for work we call,
  And shave us for the pay, sir.
    And shave us for the pay, sir,
    And shave us for the pay, sir,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, And shave us for the pay, sir.

4. The doctor, he’s a Barber too,
  And lathers with a pill, sir,
And many, applcants, or few,
  He shaves us with a bill, sir.
    He shaves us with a bill, sir,
    He shaves us with a bill, sir,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, He shaves us with a bill, sir.

5. The Merchant, he’s a Barber too,
  Then who than he surpasses;
He lathers well fine calico,
  And shaves the pretty lasses.
    And shaves the pretty lasses,
    And shaves the pretty lasses,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, And shaves the pretty lasses.

6. But of all the suds bedaubing host,
  With razors whet the keenest,
The Lawyers lather folkes the most
  And shave mankind the cleanest.
    And shave mankind the cleanest,
    And shave mankind the cleanest,
Ho, ho, ho, ho, And shave mankind the cleanest.
