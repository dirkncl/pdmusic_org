One Pompy O Smash courted Miss Dinar Coal,
She was hansome to view an as strat as a pole,
An Pomp was so proud dat de niggs would all say,
When dey seen him a comen 'Git out od de way!'
De first time he seen her 'twas washin de close,
She was soap to the eyes and suds up de nose,
And she looked in de tub when de close was all down,
Den so high as so dry were dey hung in de dun,
De rain comein down ebry rag was wet through,
When de wind blow de gust den de line broke into,
All de close dey come tumble-ing down wid a crash!
Blow high an lay low, sez bold Pompy O Smash.

Now Dinah sat down on an ole holler log
Sez Pompey by gosh if I dont go de hog,
He set im down by her an buse her tick lipps,
She sink an she smile like a basket ob chipps,
Sez Pompey Dear Dinar tell me how you feel?
Sez she like a boot dats run down at de heel;
As I dream todder night as I lay wide awake,
Dat Sam Johnson gub me a peice ob hoe cake;
Dar some udder fact dat I sartinly dreamp,
He sware he would hab me or bust in de temp!
Sez Pompey my lub dont you tink on sech trash,
Kase I'll hab you myself! sez bold Pompey O Smash.

Den Pompey de rogue lay he arm roun her waise,
An led her away o de parson in haste,
Den he gib a dollar widout any joke,
To marry dem same like he marry white folk.
So dey stood up togedder by each odders side,
And de parson mon make dem both husband and bride,
Sez Pomp I'll stick to you as long as I lib,
An hug her so tight dat he broke ebry rib,
Pomp put on his hat-- Dinar cotch hold his arm,
An de Priest for de tin-- gin to feel some alarm,
Sez he be quick Pompy an shell out de cash!
You nue kiss de bride, sez Bold Pompey O Smash.

Now Pompy and Dinar dey both did agree,
To vite all de niggars to come in a spree,
Pomp shouldered his meal bag, for corn crib him break,
And he stole enuff corn for to bake de hoe cake.
He lifted de meal bag widout half a try,
Den look all aroun him both running an sly,
Tinks he to himself dar am no one in sight,
He stole nudder bushel dont you tink he was right,
Den when he got home his Dear Dinar was gone,
SHe run off wid Sam while he gone for de corn;
He tro down de meal bag an arter dem dash,
Debble take de hindmost! sez Pompey O Smash.
