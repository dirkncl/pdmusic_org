1. Think gently of the erring, Ye know not of the power 
With which the dark temptation came in some enguarded hour, 
Ye may not know how earnestly they struggled, or how well, 
Until the hour of weakness came, and sadly thus they fell. 
Until the hour of weakness came and sadly thus they fell.

2. Think gently of the erring, Oh do not then forget, 
However darkly stained by sin, he is thy brother yet. 
Heir of the self same heritage; child of the self same God. 
He hath but stumbled in the path thou hast in weakness trod, 
He hath but stumbled in the path, thou hast in weakness trod.

3. Speak gently to the erring, for it is not enough,
That innocence and peace have gone, without thy censure rough?
It sure must be a weary lot, that sincrushed heart to bear,
And they who share a happier fate, their chidings well may spare.
And they who share a happier fate, their chidings well may spare.


4. Speak kindly to the erring, then yet may’st lend them back:
With holy words and tones of love from misery’s thorny track;
Forget not, thou hast often sinned, and sinful yet may be,
Deal gently with the erring one, as God hath delt with thee.
Deal gently with the erring one, as God hath delt with thee.
