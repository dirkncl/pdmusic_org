1.
I liv'd in Alabama
  My Massa's name was Beal
He us'd to own a yaller gal
  Her name was Lucy Neal,
She us'd to go out wid us
  To pick cotton in the fiel'
And dere's whar first I fell in lub
  Wid my sweet Lucy Neal.

Oh poor Lucy Neal;
Oh poor Lucy Neal;
If I had you by my side
How happy I should feel.

CHORUS
Oh poor Lucy Neal,
Oh poor Lucy Neal,
If I had you by my side
How happy I should feel.

2.
One night de Niggers gabe a ball;
  Miss Lucy danc'd a reel,
And all declared no darkee dare
  Could dance like Lucy Neal
After dat my Massa sell me,
  Because he thought I'd steal,
Which caused a separation
  Ob myself and Lucy Neal.

Oh poor Lucy Neal;
Oh poor Lucy Neal;
If I had you by my side
How happy I should feel.

(CHORUS)

3.
Poor Lucy she was taken ill,
  How bad it made me feel, --
De Docter he did gib he up,
  Alas poor Lucy Neal!
One day I got a letter,
  And jet black was the seal;
It was to tell me she was dead
  My poor Miss Lucy Neal.

Oh poor Lucy Neal;
Oh poor Lucy Neal;
If I had you by my side
How happy I should feel.

(CHORUS)

4.
Dey bore her from my bosom,
  But de wound dy cannot heal;
And my heart is breaking,
  For I lub'd sweet Lucy Neal.
Oh yes and when I'm dying,
  And dark visions round me steal,
De last low murmur of dis life
  Shall be sweet Lucy Neal.

Oh poor Lucy Neal;
Oh poor Lucy Neal;
If I had you by my side
How happy I should feel.

(CHORUS)

And no one could at all compare,

Sweet, simple Lucy Neal.

And that's de way he parted
Poor me and Lucy Neal.

Ob de death of Lucy Neal.
