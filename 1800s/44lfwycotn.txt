1.
As I was lumb'ring down de street
  down de street
  down de street
A pretty girl I chanc'd to meet
O she was fair to view

CHORUS
Den lubly Fan will you cum out to night,
  will you cum out to night,
  will you cum out to night,
Den lubly Fan will you cum out to night,
An dance by de lite ob de moon.

2.
I stopt her an I had some talk,
  Had some talk,
  Had some talk,
But her foot covered up de whole side walk
And left no room for me.

(CHORUS)

3.
She's de prettiest gal ibe seen in my life,
  Seen in my life,
  Seen in my life,
An I wish to de Lord she was my wife,
Den we would part no more.

(CHORUS)

4.
I lub to taste dem lubly libs,
  Lubly lips,
  Lubly lips,
Oh den I sure would lose my wits,
An drop down on de floor.

(CHORUS)

5.
Her lips are like de oyster plant,
  De oyster plant,
  De oyster plant,
I try to kiss dem but I cant,
Dey am so berry large.

(CHORUS)

6.
Oh make haste Fan dont make me wait,
  Make me wait,
  Make me wait,
I fear you've kept me now too late,
Yes dare's de ebening gun.

(CHORUS)

7.
Yes lubly Fan will you cum out to night,
  Cum out to night,
  Cum out to night,
Yes lubly Fan will you cum out to night,
And dance by de light ob de moon.

CHORUS
Lubly Fan is cumming out to night
  Cumming out to night
  Cumming out to night
[Lubly Fan is cumming out to night]
Far to dance by de lite of de moon.

1.
As I was lumb'ring down the street,
  Down the street, down the street,
A handsome gal I chanc'd to meet;
Oh! she was fair to view.

[CHORUS]
Buffalo gals, can't you come out to night?
  Can't you come out to night?
  Can't you come out to night?
And dance by de light ob de moon.

2.
I ax'd her would she hab some talk,
  Hab some talk, hab some talk,
Her feet cover'd up de whole sidewalk,
As she stood close by me.

(CHORUS)

3.
I ax'd her would she hab a dance,
  Hab a dance, hab a dance,
I taught dat I might get a chance,
To shake a foot wid her.

(CHORUS)

4.
I'd like to make that gal my wife,
  Gal my wife, gal my wife,
I'd be happy all my life,
If I had her by me.

(CHORUS)
