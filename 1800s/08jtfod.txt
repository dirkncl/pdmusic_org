1.
The Sun has gane down o'er the lofty Benlomond,
  And left the red Clouds to preside o'er the scene,
While lanely I stray in the calm simmer gloaming,
  To muse on sweet Jessie the flow'r o' Dumblane.
How sweet is the brier wi' its saft faulding bloosm,
  And sweet is the birk, wi' its mantle o' green;
Yet sweeter an' fairer an' dear to this bosom,
  Is lovely young Jessie the flow'r o' Dumblane.

[REFRAIN]
Is lovely young Jessie, is lovely young Jessie,
Is lovely young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane.

2.
She's modest as ony, an' blithe as she's bonny,
  For guileless simplicity marks her it's ain;
An' far be the villan, divested o' feeling,
  Wha'd blight in it's bloom, the sweet flow'r o' Dumblane.
Sing on thou seet mavis, thy hymn to the e'ening,
  Thou'rt dear to the echoes o' Calder-wood glen;
Sae dear to this bosom, sae artless and winning,
  Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane.

3.
How lost were my days, 'till I met wi' my Jessie,
  The sports o' the city seem'd foolish and vain,
I ne'er saw a Nymph I would ca' my dear lassie,
  'Till charm'd wi' sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane.
Though mine were the station, o' loftiest grandeur,
  Amidst it's profusion, I'd languish in pain,
An' recon as naething the height o' it's splendour,
  If wanting sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane.
