1. Soldier rest thy warfare o’er. 
  Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking 
Dream of battles fields no more 
  Days of danger, nights of waking 
In our life’s enchanted hall 
  Hands unseen thy couch dethrowing 
Fairy strains of music fall 
  Ev’ry sense  in slumber dewing 
Soldier rest thy warfare o’er 
Dream of fighting fields no more 
Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking morn 
Of [fool?] nor night of working.

2. No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
  Armour’s clang, or warsteed champing,
Trump nor pilrock summon here
  Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.
Yet the lark’s shrill fife may come,
  At the daybreak from the fallow,
And the bittern found his drum,
  Booming from the sedgy shallow,
Ruder sounds shall none be near,
Guards our warden challenge here,
Here’s no warstool neigh and champing,
Shouting clans or squadrons stamping.


3. Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,
  While our slumbrous spells assail ye,
Dream not with the rising sun,
  Bugles here shall sound reveille.
Sleep! the deer is in his den;
  Sleep! the hounds are by thee lying;
Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen,
  How thy gallant steed lay dying.
Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,
Think not of the rising sun,
For at dawning to assail ye,
Here no bugles sound reveille.
