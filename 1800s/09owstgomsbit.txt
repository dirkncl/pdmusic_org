1. Oh! why should the Girl of my soul be in tears 
At a meeting of rapture like this? 
Oh! why should the Girl of my soul be in tears 
At a meeting of rapture like this 
When the gloom of the past and the sorrows of years 
Have been paid by a moment of bliss, 
When the gloom of the past and the sorrows of years 
Have been paid by a moment of bliss?

2. Are they shed for that moment of blissful delight, 
Which dwells on her memory yet? 
Are they shed for that moment of blissful delight, 
Which dwells on her memory yet?
Do they flow like the dews of the love breathing night, 
From the warmth of the sun that has set.
Do they flow like the dews of the love breathing night, 
From the warmth of the sun that has set.


3. Oh! sweet is the tear on that languishing smile,
That smile which is lovliest then;
Oh! sweet is the tear on that languishing smile,
That smile which is lovliest then;
And if such are the drops that delight can beguile,
Thou shalt weep them again and again.
And if such are the drops that delight can beguile,
Thou shalt weep them again and again.
