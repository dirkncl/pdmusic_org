1 ’Tis thy will, and I must leave thee, 
Oh thou hast belov’d fare well; 
I forbear lest I should grieve thee 
Half my heartfelt pangs to tell; 
Soon a British fair will charm thee, 
Then her smiles will fondly woo; 
But though she to rapture warm thee, 
Don’t forget your poor Hindoo 
Don’t forget your poor Hindoo.

2. Oh how  blest she’ll be to please thee, 
Should her charms thy heart subdue; 
I am sure each maid that sees thee, 
Leaves thee like thy poor Hindoo; 
See how fast from thee they tear me, 
Faster still will death pursue; 
But ’tis well death will endear me, 
And thou’lt mourn thy poor Hindoo 
And thou’lt mourn thy poor Hindoo.
