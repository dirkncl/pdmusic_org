See! our native hills appear!
The house to ev’ry Switzer dear!
Yes! Our Alpine hills are free
Home of the brave and liberty!
Ev’ry heart now beats with grateful pride again!
Switzer-swords have not been drawn in vain!
Hark! the echo sounds our cry so merrily!
Our cry so merrily!
Hark! the mountain echoes come!
Ah! yes it is our native home!
Hark! The mountain echoes come!
Ah! yes it is our native, our native home!
See the land for which we fought and bled!
See! the hills from which the foe has fled!
Free we are, and free we will remain!
Switzers never fight in vain!
Hark! the mountain echoes come!
Yes! it is our native home, it is our native home!
