1. I would not live always, I ask not to stay, 
Where storm after storm, rises dark o’er the way, 
How few are the pleasures, that dawn on us here, 
Fly spirit, fly spirit, to thy Father dear.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I would not live always, I ask not to stay, 
Where storm after storm, rises dark o’er the way, 
Where storm after storm, rises dark o’er the way.

2. I would not live always, on these barren shores,
Where the soul has no pleasures, in all worldly stores;
But in heaven with angels I there shall behold,
My Saviour in glory,— my Father of old.

3. I would not live always, away from my God,
Far, far from You heav’n that blissful abode;
I long to be with Him, oh fly spirit fly,
To my heavenly mansion, oh, hie spirit hie.
