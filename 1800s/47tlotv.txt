1.
Away! now darkies away!
De horn am sounding de brake of day;
To work wid your shubble and your hoe,
When your labour is done, haste away.
  Away! now darkies away!
  De horn am sounding de brake of day;
  To work wid your shubble and your hoe,
  When your labour is done, haste away.

CHORUS
To the lily, the lily, the lily of the valley,
When work is done, we'll haste to see the lily of the valley.

2.
To marry her you hab no chance,
Her eyes is like an Injun lance,
She sings to de horse to make him prance,
And beats all darkies in de dance.

(CHORUS)
