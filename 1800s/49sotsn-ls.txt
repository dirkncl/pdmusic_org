1. Stars of the summer night, 
Far in yon azure deeps 
Hide, hide, your golden light; 
She sleeps my lady sleeps, 
She sleeps, Sleeps. 

2. Moon of the summer night, 
Far down yon western steeps 
Sink, sink, in silver light; 
She sleeps my lady sleeps, 
She sleeps, Sleeps. 

3. Wind of the summer night, 
Where yonder woodbine creeps, 
Fold, fold your pinnions light, 
She sleeps; my lady sleeps, 
She sleeps, Sleeps.

4. Dreams of the summer night, 
Tell her her lover keeps, 
Watch while in slumbers light, 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps, 
She sleeps, Sleeps.
