"Excelsior!"(circa 1843)
Duet.
Words by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-1882
Music by Michael William Balfe, 1808-1870

1.
The shades of night were falling fast,
As thro' an Alpine village pass'd
At youth, who bore 'mid snow and ice
A banner, with the strange device,
"Excelsior! Excelcior!"

2.
His brow was sad, his eye beneath
Flash'd like a falchion from its sheath,
And like a silver clarion rung,
The accents of that unknown tongue,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

3.
In happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and bright,
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,
And from his lips excap'd a groan,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

4.
"Try not the pass," the old man said,
"Dark low'rs the temppest overhead,
The roaring torrent is deep and wide,"
And loud that clarion voice replied,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

5.
"O stay, O stay," the maidedn said,
"And rest thy weary head upon this breast,"
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,
But still he answer'd, with a sigh,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

6.
"Beware the pine trees' wither'd branch,
Beware the awful avalanche,"
This was the peasant's last goodnight;
A voice replied, far up the height,
"Excelsior! (Excelsior!)
"Excelsior! (Excelsior!)
"Excelsior!

7.
At break of day, as heavenward,
The pious monks of San Bernard
Utter'd an oft repeated pray'r,
A voice cried thro' the startled air,
A voice cried thro' the startled air,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

8.
A trav'ler, by the faithful hound,
Half buried in the snow was found,
Still grasping in his hand of ice
That banner with the strange device,
That banner with the strange device,
"Excelsior! Excelsior!"

9.
There in the twilight cold and grey,
Lifeless, but beautiful he lay,
And from the sky serene and far,
A voice fell like a falling star,
|: "Excelsior! (Excelsior!) :| [11 times]
