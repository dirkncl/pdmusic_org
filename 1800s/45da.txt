1. Oh! Dermot Astore! between waking and sleeping, 
I heard thy dear voice, and I wept to its lay;
Ev’ry pulse of my heart, the sweet measure was keeping, 
’Till Killarney’s wild echoes had borne it away.
Oh! tell me, my own Love, is this our last meeting?
Shall we wander no more in Killarney’s green bowers, 
To watch the bright sun o’er the dim hills retreating, 
And the wild stag at rest in his bed of spring flowers.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Oh! Dermot Astore! between waking and sleeping, 
I heard thy dear voice and I wept to its lay;
Ev’ry pulse of my heart, the sweet measure was keeping, 
’Til Killarney’s wild echoes had borne it away.

2. Oh! Dermot Astore! how this fond heart would flutter, 
When I met thee by night, in the shady bosom, 
And heard thine own voice in a soft whisper utter 
Those words of endearment, “Mavourneen Coleen,” 
I know we meet past, but oh! say not forever, 
That it may be for years adds enough to my pain;
But I’ll cling to the hope that tho’ now we must sever, 
In some blessed hour I shall meet thee again.
