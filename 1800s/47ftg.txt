1. Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to de cotton fields an cane brake so tall;
Farewell to her waters,
Her sweet yaller darters,
An farewell to young Rosa
Der sweetest ob dem all.

My Master is goin
Whar de broad sea is flowin,
An de grey flowers growin,
In de land far away.
And I now must foller
From my green shady holler,
But I'd gib a golden dollar,
If he'd leab Gumbo stay. Oh!

Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to de cotton fields an cane brake so tall;
Farewell to her waters,
Her sweet yaller darters,
An farewell to young Rosa
Der sweetest ob dem all.

2. Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to de wild birds an de green trees so tall;
Farewell to de rivers,
Whar de yaller lilly quivers,
An farewell to young Rosa
Der fairest ob dem all.

When I'se a faithful valet,
Far from my native alley,
I'll ne'er forget de valley,
Whar my Rosey first did blow
Whare'er dar blooms a flower,
I shall feel her charms sole power,
An dis heart shall beat each hour,
Upon love's banjo. Oh!

Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to Georgia,
Farewell to de wild birds an de green trees so tall;
Farewell to de rivers,
Whar de yaller lilly quivers,
An farewell to young Rosa
Der fairest ob dem all.
