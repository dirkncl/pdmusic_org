Chorus. [ATTB]
Oh! the belles of Baltimore!
The charming belles of Baltimore!

[1st] Bass Solo.
My head is craz’d, my heart amaz’d,
Among the belles of Baltimore the belles of Baltimore.

Tutti. [ATTB]
Oh! the belles of Baltimore!
The charming belles of Baltimore!
The charming belles of Baltimore!

1st Tenor Solo.
The I’ve seen the belles of haughty Spain,
With sunny cheek and laughing eye,
The fairhair’d belles of Allemain,
With sanft Ge fuhl und Schwarmerey,
I’ve lov’d the laughing belles of France,
Yet England’s beauties touch me more:
But none could e’er my heart entrance
Like thy fair belles, sweet Baltimore!
Like thy fair belles, sweeet Baltimore!

[REPEAT Chorus, (1st) Bass Solo, Tutti and 1st Tenor Solo.]

[2nd] Bass Solo.
New York has belles with true dutch names,
With Peri forms and Paris graces;
And Philadelphia gentle dames,
With throbbing hearts, but quiet faces,
There’s Boston belles of heavenly blue,
Who talk so sweet of learned lore,
There’s Norfolk, Richmond, Charleston, too,
But all must yield to Baltimore!
But all must yield to Baltimore!
But all must yield to Baltimore!

[REPEAT Chorus, (1st) Bass Solo, Tutti and 1st Tenor Solo.]

Tenor Solo 3rd Voice. (may be omitted.)
Her belles. her belles, too, rate of ev’ry  class,
E’en like the vessels of her skippers;
Some like tall frigates stately pass,
And some are little raking clippers,
Then haste, ye beauz, from ev’ry part,
From far key west to Labrador,
Who e’er  would traffic with his heart,
Will find his match in Baltimore, in Baltimore!

Chorus.
Oh! the belles of Baltimore!
The blooming belles of Baltimore!

[3rd] Bass Solo.
Had I a thousand hearts to lose,
I’d lose them all in Baltimore! them all in Baltimore!

Chorus.
Oh! the belles of Baltimore!
The blooming belles of Baltimore!
The blooming belles of Baltimore!
