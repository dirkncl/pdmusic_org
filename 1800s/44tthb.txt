1. Oh wilt thou be dear maiden
The Texian hunter’s bride
And tend his forest bower
By Colorado’s side.
Thy distant home forgetting
That other home to prize
Where, where the sun is setting
But where our sun must rise.
  But where our sun must rise.

2. I bring no wealth to woo thee,
But in my grasp I bear
The weapon, at whose whisper,
The forest nations fear;
The wild Cumanche flies the track
That I have blazed for thee,
And when I wind this yellow horn,
The tiger seeks his tree.
  The tiger seeks his tree.

3. And gay with richest flowers
And green with leafy shade,
Shall be the forest bowers
That love for thee has made;
No high and haughty palace,
But smiling through the green,
Of waving sealike vallies
Our snow white cot is seen.
  Our snow white cot is seen.

4. But if like maid of Europe,
Still prouder thoughts be thine
Then, by my steed and rifle
A bolder aim than mine:—
The single star above me,
And what Mexique powers?
Ho! maid— if thou but love me,
For Montezuma’s towers!
  For Montezuma’s towers!
