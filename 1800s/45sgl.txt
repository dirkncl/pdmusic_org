1. Slumber gentle Lady,
Slumber like the rose;
Where the air of evening,
Lulls it to repose.
Angels hover o’er thee
Softly seal thine eyes,
Waft thy spirit gently
To the smiling skies.

2. When the light of morning,
Chases sleeep away;
May the heart beat lightly,
’Till the close of day;
Thus may life flow calmly,
Like a summer sea;
Every moment freighted,
With new joys for thee.
