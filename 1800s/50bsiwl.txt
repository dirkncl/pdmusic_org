1. Brother speak in whispers light, 
’Tis my last, my last good night; 
Never more our steps will stray, 
Through the gardens scented way. 
By the homestead of the bees, 
’Neath the shady chesnut trees; 
By the rivers winding stream, 
Glitt’ring in the sunset beam. 
Gentle brother smile and bless, 
’Tis my last, my last caress; 
  Gentle brother smile and bless, 
  ’Tis my last, my last caress.

2. Sister with thine eyes of blue, 
Hither come and weep adieu; 
Let thy arm around me twine, 
Let thy cheek repose on mine. 
While I gaze into thy face, 
Circled in this dear embrace; 
Thou has ever proved to me, 
All that love could wish to be. 
Yet I leave thy heart alone, 
Brother, Sister, bless our own. 
  Yet I leave thy heart alone, 
  Brother, Sister, bless our own.

3. Mother, thou hast rocked my head,
Softly on my cradled bed;
When the storm was raging high,
Sweetly sang love’s lullaby.
Yet I part— I part from thee,
Who henceforth will sing to me?
When my forehead aches with pain,
I shall miss that early strain.
Mother with thy accents mild,
Bless, O! Bless! thy weeping child.
  Mother with thy accents mild,
  Bless, O! Bless! thy weeping child.
