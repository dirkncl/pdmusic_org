"Stop That Knocking at the Door" (1847)
Words and Music by A.F. Winnemore

1.
I once did lub a col-ored Gal......
Whose name was Su-zy Brown,
She came from old Vir-gin-ny, 
She was de fair-est in de town;
Her eyes so bright, dey shine at night 
When de moon am gone a-way,
She used to call this dar-key up..... 
Just a-fore de broke of day:

REFRAIN
Wid a who dar? who dar? who dar? 
An' a who dar a knock-ing at my door?
Am dat you Sam? Am dat you Sam? 
No you bet-ter stop dat knock-ing at my door.
Stop that knock-ing. 
Stop that knock-ing. 
Oh! you bet-ter stop that knock-ing at my door.
Stop that knock-ing. 
Stop that knock-ing. 
Oh! you bet-ter stop that knock-ing at my door.

CHORUS
Stop that knock-ing, stop that knock-ing, 
stop that knock-ing, stop that knock-ing,
Oh! you bet-ter stop that knock-ing at my door.
Stop that knock-ing, stop that knock-ing, 
stop that knock-ing, stop that knock-ing,
Oh! you bet-ter stop that knock-ing at my door.

2.
She was the pretti-est yal-ler Gal 
That eb-er I did see,
She never would go a-walk-ing, 
Wid a-ny Col-or'd man but me.
And when I took my Ban-jo down, 
And _ played three tunes or more,
All_at once I heard three raps, pretty hard...........
Come _ bang a-gain' my door

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
Oh_de first one dat cum in de room, 
Was_a dark-ey dressed to death,
He looked just like de show-man, 
What _ dey used to call Mack-beth.
He said he was a Cali-forni man, 
And _ just ar-rived on shore,
I ax_him whare fore he cum an rap, 
So _ hard a-gainst my door.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
