1.
Darkies come, the sun is sinking,
  Fading is its golden light;
And the perfumed flow'rs are drinking
  Pearly dewdrops fresh and bright.
From the cotton plants you're hoeing,
From the fields where bacco's growing,
  Come and dance to night.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Darkies come, iur work is done,
  Put up the spade and hoe,
Take down the banjo from the wall,
  The fiddle and the bow.

2.
Darkies come, our work is ended,
  And the stars are shining brightl
And our songs with music blended
  Sweetly cheer the hours of night.
Come, no more of labour thinking,
While the flowers the dew is drinking
  Come and dance to night.
