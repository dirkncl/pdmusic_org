1.
Did you ne’er hear a tale, how a Youth in the Vale,
  Ask’d a Damsel to grant him a Kiss,
Where this pretty Maid cry’d, no it must be deny’d,
  Yet all the while wish’d to say yes,
For when on her Pillow, she sigh’d for the Willow,
  Where Ed ward first saw pretty Sally,
Or rather in truth, she sigh’d for the Youth,
  Adown, adown, adown in the Valley.

2.
Did you ne’er hear it said, when he ask’d her to wed,
  And told her true love prompted so,
How this silly Maid spoke? to be sure ’twas in joke,
  For she answer’d, him, “Shepherd so, so,”
  Where Edward first saw pretty Sally;
Or, rather in truth, she sigh’d for the Youth,
  Adown adown in the Valley. 

3.
But, ah, now you shall find, how this Maid chang’d her mind,
  When a twelvemonth had pass’d after this;
For when he next press’d, at the Church to be blest,
  O, she answer’d dear “Shepherd, yes, yes”!
Now when on her Pillow, more sigh’d for the Willow,
  Where Edward first saw pretty Sally
But bless’d the fond Day, they to Church flew away,
  Adown adown adown in the Valley.
