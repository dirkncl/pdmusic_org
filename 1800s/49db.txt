1. Now blackmen come around me,
  And listen to my song,
I’ll sing you of a darkie Gal
  Who in Kentuck was born,
She had such charming jet black eyes,
  Her teeth dey shone like silver,
Dar was no Gal in all Kentuck
  Compar’d with my Belinda.

CHORUS 1.—3. [sung twice]
Den I’m tap tap tapping at de winder,
  Dont you hear me my dearest Belinda,
For I’ll knock here no more so open your door,
  For I know you’r as black as a cinder.

2. One night I went to visit her,
  I tapped upon the door,
If I’d known who was in dar,
  I’d quit de house before.
I op’d the door I looked around,
  It fill’d me with surprise!
Dar sit my rival Count Mustache,
  I scarce believe my eyes.

3. I left the house I felt so bad,
  I knew not where I went,
I thought I’d drown all in a drink;
  But found I hadn’t a cent,
Belinda made me feel so bad,
  I wished my rival dead:
My feelings got de best of me,
  And so I went to bed.  

4. In de morning when dis nigger wake,
  I tink ob all dat past,
Belinda treat me very bad,
  But I found her out at last,
I go and bid her den farewell!
  I’ll see her act again,
I since have found another gal,
  And loved her not in vain.

CHORUS 4. [sung twice]
Den I’ll tap no more upon de winder,
  To my false hearted fickle Belinda,
For I’ll knock no more,
  So neber mind your door,
For I know your as black as a cinder.
