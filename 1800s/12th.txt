1.
I was a wild and wayward boy,
My childhood scorn'd each childish toy,
  I was a wild and wayward boy,
  My childhood scorn'd each childish toy.
Retired from all, refered and coy,
  Retired from all, refered and coy
To musing prone, to musing prone
I wowed my solitary joy
  My harp alone, my harp alone
  I wowed my solitary joy
  My harp alone, my harp alone.

[NOTE: all other verses sung similarly as 1]

2.
My youth withheld Ambition's mood,
Despised the humble stream and wood
Where my poor father's cottage stood.
  To fame unknown:--
What should my soaring wings make good?
  My harp alone.

3.
Love came with all his frantic fire,
And wild romance of vain desire,
The baron's daighter heard my lyre,
  And praised the town.
What could presumptuous hope inspire?
  My harp alone.

4.
At Manhood's touch the bubble burst,
And Manhood's pride the vision curst,
And all that had my folly nursed
  Love's sway to own,
Yet spared the spell that lulled me [fleft?]
  My harp alone.

5.
We came with war, and want with wo[e],
And it was mine to undergo
Each outrage of the rebel fee:--
  Can aught atone
My fields made waste, my cot laid low?
  My harp alone!

6.
Ambition's dreams I've seen depart,
Have rued of penury the smart.
Have felt of love the venomed dart,
  When hope was flown;
Yet rests one solace to my heart.
  My harp alone!

7.
Then, over mountain, moor, and hill,
My faithful harp, I'll hear thee still,
And when this life of want and ill
  Is well nigh gone,
The Strings mine elegy shall shrill,
  My harp alone!
