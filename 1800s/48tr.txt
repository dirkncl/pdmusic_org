1. SOLO
Flow gently Tar River, thy cane brakes beside
disturb not the rest of my beautiful bride,
My [missing from source]
Flow gently Tar River, disturb not her dream.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Darkies listen to de tale he's tellin
While de lub widin his bosom dwelin
does set de niggars heart a swellin
till its like to bust, Ah!

2. SOLO
Ye wild warbling bull frogs dat croak on de shore,
disturb not her slumbers as sweetly she snores,
reclining in innocent grace by de side,
Den flow gently Tar River disturb no my bride.

3. SOLO
Ye trees wave in music you boughs to de sky
Ye katydids sing her a soft lullaby
All blacksnakes and varmints away from her keep
Approach not de place where my Dinah's asleep

4. SOLO
But let de pale moon show her face all de night
As round as a pot cheese (de niggars delight)
While still de ole Tar river rolls gently its tide
Singing sweetly to Dinah who sleeps by its side
