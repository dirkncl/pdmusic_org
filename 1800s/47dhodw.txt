1.
O, I come from ole Virginny
  Wid my head full ob knowledge,
And I never went to free school
  Nor any other college;
But one thing I will tell you,
  Which am a solid fact,
I tell you how dis world was made
  In a twinkling ob a crack.

CHORUS
Den walk in,
  Den walk in I say,
Den walk in,
  And hear de banjo play,
Den walk into de parlor,
  And hear de banjo ring,
And watch dis niggers fingers,
  While he plays upon de string.

2.
Oh, dis world was made in six days,
  And den dey made de sky,
And den dey hung it ober head
  And left it dar to dry;
And den dey made de stars
  Out ob nigger wenches eyes,
For to gib a little light
  When de moon didn't rise.

(CHORUS)

3.
So Adam was de first man,
  Ebe she was de oder,
And Cain walk'd on de treadmill,
  Because he kill'd his broder;
Ole Moder Ebe
  Couldn't sleep widout a pillar,
And de greatest man dat eber lived
  Was Jack de Giant killer.

(CHORUS)

4.
And den de made the sea,
  And in it put a whale,
And den de made a racoon,
  Wid a ring around his tail;
And all de oder animals
  Was finished one by one,
And stuck against de to dry
  As fast as they were done.

(CHORUS)

5.
O, lighning is a yellow gal,
  She libs up in de clouds,
And thunder he's a black man,
  For he can hollow loud;
When he kisses lightning,
  She dodges off in wonder,
Den he jumps and tares his trowsers,
  And dat's what makes de thunder.

(CHORUS)

6.
O, de wind begin to blow,
  And de rain begin to fall,
And de water came so high,
  But it drown'd de niggers all;
And it rain'd forty days and nights,
  Exactly by the counting,
And it landed Noah's ark
  'Pon de Alleghany Mountains.

(CHORUS)
