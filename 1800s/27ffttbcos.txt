1. Farewell— farewell— to thee bright child of song,
  Our sights waft thee o’er the dark waters;
A few fleeting days and thou shinest among,
  The fairest of Italy’s daughters;
Roam where thou wilt tho’ skies may be clearer,
  And brighter the pleasures that swell;
Thou ne’er wilt meet friends meet friends that are dearer,
   Than those who now sigh their, their farewell,
     Farewell— farewell—
   Than those who now sigh their fairwell,

2. Farewell— farewell— when the stormspirit raves,
  And winds with the billows are swelling;
Think that the hearts thou has left o’er the waves,
  With regret on thy absence are dwelling;
Oh! the thought that these scenes are retreatintg,
  Veils our bosoms in sorrow’s dark spell;
Bright visions in sadness are fleeting,
  As we breathe the last notes of farewell
    Farewell— farewell—
  As we breath the last notes of farewell.
