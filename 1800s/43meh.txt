1. Back on the misty track of time, 
In mem’ry’s flick’ring light, 
I see the scenes of other days, 
Like meteors in the night, 
The garden with its low built fence, 
With stakes and withes to tie it, 
The rude loghouse, my early home, 
And one wild maple by it, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh back on the misty track of time, 
In mem’ry’s flick’ring light, 
I see the scenes of other days, 
Like meteors in the night. 

2. Rude were the sports round that wild home, 
When little hands were twined, 
And echoing woods swept back the joy, 
Like voices in the wind 
And there gay birds on bending spray, 
Their wildwood songs have given, 
The Robin sang at dawn of day, 
And Whipoorwill at even, 

3. But leaves are scattered not more wild, 
By autumn’s winds unhurled, 
Than all that group of fa ces bright 
Upon the wide, wide world. 
But still on memory’s page in light, 
’Gainst which there’s no resistance, 
Stand out those scenes, that home and tree, 
Like nightfires, in the distance,
