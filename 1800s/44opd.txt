1. Souf Carlina I was born
I husk de wood an chop de corn,
De roastin car to de house I bring,
De nigger cotch me and I sing;--

[CHORUS sung after Verses 1 & 2]
Ring de hoop! blow de horn!
Cotch de niggers a stealin corn
Way down in de low groun fiel
3, 4 mile from Pompey's heel.

2. Dey took me out on a tater hill
Dey make ne dance against my will,
I dance all roun de tater hole
De niggers punch me wid a pole.

3. Down de riber I spied a ship,
I slid down on my under lip,
Hop on board an cross de drink,
It make de niggers gizzard wind.

[CHORUS]
Ring de hoop! an blow de horn!
Nebher felt do glad sinc I was born;
Way down in de low groun fiel
3, 4 mile from Pompey's heel.

4. To Boston port I den sail roun,
Dey said de Dickens was in town;
I as dem who de Dickens was
Dey sed 'twas massa Pickwick Bos.

[CHORUS]
Ring de hoop! an blow de horn!
Mass Dickens eat de corn,
Way down in de low groun fiel
3, 4 mile from Pompey's heel.

5. Dey fed ole massa Box so tall
His trowsaloons dey grow too small;
In Boston I couldnt get any pickins
Case all de victuals went to de Dickens.

[CHORUS]
Ring de bell! an sown de gong!
Mass Dickens' feedin strong,
Way down in de low groun fiel
3, 4 mile from Pompey's heel.
