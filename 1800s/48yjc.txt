1. 
Young Julius Crow one summer morn
  Went to the field to hoe,
And dar he spied his pretty Rose
  milking a little cow!
She sat upon an old pine knot
  And sang so light and gay,
dat Julius saw and Julius loved
  and she stole his heart away

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Singing
Tu rul le man ti naw
Singing
Tu ril le man ti naw
Singing
Tu til lil lu ril lil
lu ril li la
Sing
Tu ril lil man ti naw.

2.
Youg Julius stood and gazed awhile
  With rapture and delight,
And Rose she sat and milked away
  Till massa out ob sight--
He says to her my dearest Rose,
  Consent to be my wife,
She flung her arms around his neck
  Saying, I love you as my life.

3.
Dey early den next morning went
  Up to de Parsons door,
Resolved to lead a single life
  Of blessedness, no more,
De Parson dar did join dar hands
  And den pronounce dem one,
Dey lib in peace and harmony
  For dar life is just begun.
