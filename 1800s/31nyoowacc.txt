1.
The ardent, romantic,
  The charming god of song,
Cross's lately th'At-lantic
  Nor thought the voy'ge long;
He tripp'd along in shoes of cork,
  Singing many a ditty,
But he chang'd his song when he reache'd New York,
  To what a charming City.

[CHORUS][sung after each verse]
New York! New York!
Oh! what a charming City.
New York! New York!
Oh! what a charming City.

2.
In Bowery, in Broadway,
  He rambl'd up and down,
Took byway, and oddway,
  Resolve to see the town;
And on he went, he sung this song,
  "Now, is it not a pity,"
I should have stay'd away so long,
  From such a charming City.

3.
Here Freedom, and duty,
  And truth, and taste remain,
Here honour, and beauty,
  And love, and valour reign;
Then hither Freedom's friends resort,
  The grave, the gay, the witty,
For here I'll henceforth keep my court,
  In this delightful City.
