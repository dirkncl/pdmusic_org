1. 
The Minstrel Boy in the war is gone, 
  In the ranks of death you’ll find him, 
His father’s sword, he has girded on, 
  And his wild harp hung behind him. 
“Land of Song.” said the Warrior Bard 
  “Tho, all the world betrays  thee, 
One sword at least thy Right shall guard, 
  One faithful harp shall praise thee.

2. 
The Minstrel fell! but the foeman’s chain
  Could not bring his proud soul under;
The Harp he lov’d ne’er spoke again,
  For he tore its Chords asunder;
And said “No chains shall sully thee,
  Thou soul of Love and Bravery!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
  They shall never sound in Slavery.”
