Written by Edward Fitzball, 1792-1873

1.
My pretty Jane! my pretty Jane!
  Ah! never never look so shy.
But meet me, meet me in the Ev'ning, 
  While the bloom is on the Rye. 
The Spring is waning fast, my Love, 
  The corn is in the ear. 
The Summer nights are coming, Love, 
  The moon shines bright and clear; 
Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane, 
  Ah! never look so shy, 
But meet me, meet me in the Ev'ning, 
  While the bloom is on the Rye.

2.
But name the day, the wedding day, 
  And I will buy the ring, 
The Lads and Maids in favours white, 
  And the village bells shall ring. 
The Spring is waning fast, my Love, 
  The corn is in the ear. 
The Summer nights are coming, Love, 
  The moon shines bright and clear; 
Then pretty Jane, my dearest Jane, 
  Ah! never look so shy, 
But meet me, meet me in the Ev'ning, 
  While the bloom is on the Rye.
