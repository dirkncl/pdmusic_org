1. Will you come to the Bow’r I’ve shaded for you?.
Your bed shall he flow’rs all spangled  with dew.  
Will you come to the Bow’r I’ve shaded for you? 
Your bed shall be flow’rs all spangled with dew. 

[CHORUS  sung after each verse]
Will you, wil you, will you, will you come to the Bow’r? 
Will you, will you, will you, will you come to the Bow’r?

2. There under the Bow’r on roses you lie
With a blush in your cheek and a smile in your eye.
There under the Bow’r on roses you lie
With a blush in your cheek and a smile in your eye.

3. But the roses we press shall not rival your lip
Nor the dew be so sweet as the kisses we sip.
But the roses we press shall not rival your lip
Nor the dew be so sweet as the kisses we sip.

4. And Oh for the Joys that are sweeter than dew
From languishing roses and kisses from you.
And Oh for the Joys that are sweeter than dew
From languishing roses and kisses from you.
