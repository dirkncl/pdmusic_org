1. Weep for the gallant dead,
  Brave hearts that beat no more;
Weep for the glorious ones who bled,
When the battle morn broke darkly red,
  By the Rio Grande’s shore!

2. Weep for the valiant band,
  Who first the warsword drew
For Ringgold brave of the iron hand,
And the noble son of our Maryland,
  Our Watson! brave and true.

3. Aye! weep for the gallant chief,
  Who fell at Monterey;
Yet, joy that though his days were brief,
His life of deeds was a ripened sheaf,
  On the glorious harvest day:

4. And the sunlight of his fame
  Shall burst the cloud of woe,
And the memory of each gallant name,
Like the sacred heat of an altarflame,
  In our hearts for aye shall glow.
