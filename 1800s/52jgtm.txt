1.
I thank you, Mister Jacob, but I'm not inclin'd to go,
Your wagon is so clumsey, and your team so very slow,
And 'tho 'twould make you happy with your Phillis by your side,
To go in such a "turn-out" would be shocking to my pride.

CHORUS 1
To ride in a wagon,
An old rusty wagon,
A squeaking lumber wagon,
'Twould be shocking to my pride;
Besided, a jolting wagon
I never could abide.

2.
And then that sweeet "love story" which has weighed upon your heart,"
Must be a queer sensation which affects another part;
Your love is in you stomach, and no doubt 'tis very sweet
To think, when e'er I'm by your side, of "something good to eat."

CHORUS 2
Away with your wagon,
An old rusty wagon,
A squeaking, lumber wagon,
To you it must be sweet,
But in a common wagon,
I would scorn to take a seat.

3.
Perhaps you may consider that I'm very hard to please,
But I can ne'er be happy in a dairy making cheese;
So keep you little farm house, and just go and mind your plough,
I'm sure I can do better than consent to milk your cow.

CHORUS 3
And ride in a wagon,
An old rusty wagon,
A squeeaking, lumber wagon,
With horses from the plough--
To think of such a wagon,
It mortifies me now!

4.
Old Mike was not so stingy when he ask'd me for his bride,
As to bring a clumsy wagon, and invite me out to ride;
And tho' he's not so handsome quite as you may deem yourself,
I think him quite acceptable--especially "his pelf."

CHORUS
I'll ride in a carriage,
A fine gilded carriage,
An easy cushion'd carriage,
And own it all my self--
I'll not decline a marriage
With old Mike--and "all his pelf."
