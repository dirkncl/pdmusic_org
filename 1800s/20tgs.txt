* The idea is supposed to be taken from the _Oases_,
the verdant isles in the arid deserts of Africa, which afford
refreshment and repose to the way worn pilgrim and traveller.

1. O’er the desert of life, when you vainly pursued, 
Those phantoms of hope which their promise disown; 
Have you ne’er met some spirit, divinely endued, 
That so kindly could say, you don’t suffer alone? 
And however our fate may have smil’d or have frown’d, 
Will she deign still to share as the friend or the wife? 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then make her the pulse of your heart for you’ve found, 
The green spot that blooms o’er the desert of life.

2. Does she love to recall the past moments so dear, 
When the sweet pledge of faith was confidingly given, 
When the lip spoke the voice of affection sincere, 
And the vow was exchanged and recorded in heaven? 
Does she wish to rebind what was  already bound, 
And draw closer the claim of the friend or the wife?
