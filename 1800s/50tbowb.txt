1. The moon was shining brightly 
Upon de ole cornfield, 
De darkies dere tipp’d lightly 
The ole Virginia reel, 
The darkies was a dancing 
With step so light and gay 
When came de lubly Dinah, 
The Belle of Winyaw Bay. 

CHORUS 1
The darkies was a dancing 
With step so light and gay 
When came the lubly Dinah 
The Belle of Winjaw Bay.

2. She gave one look of pleasure
Upon that happy scene
Then joined in tromping there
To the sound of the tambourine
And when the tired darkies
For anything did pray
Twas for the lubly Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.

CHORUS 2
And when the tired darkies
For anything did pray
Twas for the lubly Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.

3. Then she did give them water
To cool the darkies throats
And then she caper’d gaily
To the banjo’s mellow notes
And when the old horn sounded
Jist at the broke of day
They blease the lubly Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.

CHORUS 3
And when the old horn sounded
Jist at the broke of day
They blease the lubly Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.

4. Tho well she loved old Massa
And prayed that he might live
Yet when there was a dancing
She had a foot to give
Then heres to that sweet beauty
That stole my heart away
The black eyed gal sweet Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.

CHORUS 4
Then heres to that sweet beauty
That stole my heart away
The black eyed gal sweet Dinah
The Belle of Winyaw Bay.
