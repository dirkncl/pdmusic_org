1. 
I remember, I remember
The house where I was born,
The little window where the sun
Came peeping in at morn;
He never came a wink too soon,
Nor brought too long a day,
But now, I often wish that night
Had bourne my breath away!
  But now, I often wish that night
  Had bourne my breath away!

2. 
I remember, I remember
The roses, red and white,
The vi’lets and the lilly cups,
Those flowers made of light!
The lilacks where the robin built,
And where my brother set
The liburnum on his birthday,–
The tree is living yet!!
  The liburnum on his birthday,–
  The tree is living yet!!


3. 
I remember, I remember
Where I was used to swing,
And thought the air must rush as fresh
To swallows on the wing;
My spririts flew in feathers then,
That is so heavy now,
And summers pools could hardly cool
The fever on my brow!
  And summers pools could hardly cool
  The fever on my brow!


4. 
I remember, I remember
The fir trees dark and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky,
It was a childish ignorance,
But now ’tis little joy
To know I’m farther off from heav’n
Than when I was a boy.
  To know I’m farther off from heav’n
  Than when I was a boy.
