1. The last link is broken that bound me to thee, 
And the words thou hast spoken have render’d me free;
That bright glance misleading, on others may shine, 
Those eyes smil’d unheeding when tears burst from mine.
If my love was deem’d boldness that error is o’er.
I’ve witness’d thy coldness and prize thee no more.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
I have not lov’d lightly, I’ll think on thee yet.
I’ll pray for thee nightly, till life’s sun has set;
I have not lov’d lightly, I’ll think on thee yet, 
I’ll pray for thee nightly till life’s sun has set.

2. The heart thou hast broken once doted on thee, 
And the words I have spoken prove sorrow to me;
Oh! had’st thou then treasur’d my thoughts spoken free, 
Those could’st not have measur’d thine own love to me.
But oh! thou hast sorrow.d the heart that was thine, 
I’ll return to thee, borrow’d, the one I thought mine.
