1.
Despondency is all the rage
  And moping all the go,
Our husbands, sweethearts, all are gone
  Away to Mexico!
Some never smile; some offer sobs;
  Some cry, outright, with woe;
Till one would think mankind were all
  Away in Mexico.
One would think mankind were all
  Away in Mexico.

2.
You ask Miss Snooks, “Why, what ails you?”
  Her tone is sad and low,
As she replies— “My George has gone
  Away to Mexico!”
Some wives who used to vex their lords,
  Until they jump’d Jim Crow,
Now cry they long to be with them,
  Away to Mexico.

3.
But when dear HUBBY does come back,
  (It always turns out so)
How oft, poor soul, he’ll wish he was
  Away in Mexico.
Some wives have faces three feet long,
  The reason I don’t know,
But think they dread their lords may come
  Away from Mexico.

4.
There’s Mrs. Stubbs, the other day,
  Was talking very slow
About her grief for poor, dear Stubbs
  Away in Mexico.
And, all the time, here eyes were fix’d
  On handsome Captain DOUGH,
Worth fifty of her husband— Stubbs—
  Away in Mexico.

5.
But all that wives are now about
  I do not choose to show,
But think their husbands better come
  Away from Mexico.
But I’m a maid, and have no lord,
  Although I have a beau,
Who’se gone, among the volunteers,
  Away to Mexico.

6.
I’m true to him— yet love to flirt—
  And have a youth in tow,
Who’d do as well, were poor Charles hurt,
  Away in Mexico.
So, ladies, dry your weeping eyes,
  Nor let their currents flow;
We’ve chaps on hand as good as those
  Away in Mexico.

7.
Then, whilst our hearts are free as winds
  That from the northwest blow,
We’ll letters write to gull our swains
  Away in Mexico.
                     POSTSCRIPT
“Whilst shine the sun,” the proverb says,
  “Your hay you’d better mow,”
So, verbum sap to those who’ve lords
  Away in Mexico.
