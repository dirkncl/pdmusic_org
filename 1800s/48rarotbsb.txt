1. Oh! there’s not a canvas going worth showing or knowing 
Like that from glory growing for our “Bold soger Boy!” 
Away “ROUGH AND READY’LL” go soon you’ll know friend or foe, 
The Polls will quickly show 
He’s the “Bold soger Boy.” 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
There’s not a town he’ll march thro’ but voters looking arch thro’ 
The cavalcade will sarch thro’ to find the Nation’s joy, 
While in the street each man you meet will cry I vote, 
will cry I vote for Zachery the darling the “Bold soger Boy.”

2. When the rest have got the rout,
Oh! they’ll pout,
And they’ll shout,
Then go to the right about
For the “Bold soger Boy.”
When in the White House Chair
Won’t that pair,
Tear their hair,
But he’ll get there soft and fair,
Will our “Bold soger Boy.”

3. Sure we see the game before us,
Though with “Pledges” they may bore us;
All the people will encore us,
And sing our songs with joy!
What is that we hear?
Repeat that cheer;
It’s loud and clear!
Hurrah! we shout,
For Zachery the darling,
The Bold soger Boy.
