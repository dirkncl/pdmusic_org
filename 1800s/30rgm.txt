1. Day has gone down on the Baltic’s broad billow,
Ev’ning has sigh’d her last to the lone willow;
The Baltic’s broad billow,
Ev’ning has sigh’d her last to the lone willow
Night hurries on, night hurries on earth and ocean to cover,
Night hurries on, night hurrires on earth and ocean to cover
Rise gentle moon and lgiht me to my lover, gentle moon,
gentle moon and light me to my lover.

2. ’Twas by thy beam he first stole forth to woo me,
Brighter since then hast thou ever seem’d to me;
First stole forth to woo me,
Brighter since then hast thou ever seem’d to me:
Let the wild waves still, let the wild waves still, the red sun roll over,
Let the wild waves still,
Let the wild waves still the red sun roll over.
Thine is the light of all lights to a lover, gentle moon,
gentle moon, rise gentle, gentle moon.
