"She Wore a Wreath of Roses" (1839)
Words by Thomas Haynes Bayly, 1797-1829
Music by Joseph Philip Knight, 1812-1887

1.
She wore a wreath of roses,
The night that first we met;
Her lovely face was smiling
Beneath her curls of jet;
Her footstep had the lightness,
Her voice the joyous tone,
The tokens of a youthful heart,
Where sorrow is unknown.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now,
With the wreath of summer flowers,
Upon her snowy brow.

2.
A wreath of orange blossoms
When next we met she wore;
Th’ expression of her features
Was more thoughtful than before;
And standing by her side was one,
Who strove, and not in vain,
To soothe her leaving that dear home,
She ne’er might view again.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now,
With the wreath of orange blossoms
Upon her snowy brow.

3.
And once again I see that brow,
No bridal wreath was there,
The widow’s sombre cap conceals
Her once luxuriant hair;
She weeps in silent solitude,
And there is no one near,
To press her hand within his own,
And wipe away the tear.
I saw her brokenhearted,
Yet methinks I see her now,
In the pride of youth and beauty,
With a garland on her brow.
