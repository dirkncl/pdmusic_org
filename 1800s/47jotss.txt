1.
Ere the twilight bat was flitting,
In the sunset, at her knitting,
Sang a lonely maiden, sitting
  Underneath her threshold tree;
And, ere daylight died before us,
And the vesper stars shone o'er us,
Fitful rose her tender chorus--
  "Jamie's on the stormy sea!"

2.
Warmly shone the sunset glowing;
Sweetly breath'd the young flow'rs blowing
Earth, with beauty overflowing,
  Seem'd the home of love to be,
As those angel tones ascending,
With the scene and season blending,
Ever had the same low ending--
  "Jamie's on the stormy sea!"

3.
Curfew bells remotely ringing,
Mingled with that sweet voice singing
And the last red ray seemed clinging
  Lingeringly to tower and tree;
Nearer as I came, and nearer,
Finer rose the notes, and clearer;
Oh! 'twas heaven itself to hear her--
  "Jamie's on the stormy sea!"

4.
"Blow, ye west winds! blandly hover
O'er the bark that bears my lover;
Gently blow, and bear him over
  To his own dear home and me;
For, when night winds bend the willow,
Sleep forsakes my lonely pillow,
Thinking of the foaming billow--
  "Jamie's on the stormy sea!"

5.
How could I but list, but linger,
To the song, and near the singer,
Sweetly wooing heaven to bring her
  Jamie from the stormy sea;
And while yet her lips did name me,
Forth I sprang -- my heart o'ercame me--
"Grieve no more, sweet, I am Jamie,
  Home returned to love and thee!"
