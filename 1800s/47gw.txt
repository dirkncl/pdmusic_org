1. O pleasant de song dat I sing,
  And well I remember the day,
When the little church bells they did ring,
  And the darkies were done making hay.
   When de birds were at rest
    And lay snug in their nest,
And de clouds they look’d pleasant and clear,
  Sweet Rosa was happy indeed,
When to church she and Ginger did steer.

CHORUS 1.
  When de birds were at rest,
  And lay snug in their nest,
And de clouds dey look’d pleasant and clear;
  Sweet Rosa was happy indeed,
When to church she and Ginger did steer.


2. Dey were going to be married dat day,
  And de darkies were all to be there,
In de little log church by de way,
  Wid de color’d gals looking so fair.
    Den locked arm in arm,
    For fear of some harm,
Dis couple went skipping along
  And Rosa felt happy day day
As she sang dat sweet nightengale song.

3. Shall I eber forget it indeed?
  How happy de darkies did look
When de parson he den did proceed
  By perusing de highmonial book!
    Den he asked lovely Rosa,
    If wedded she’d be
And take Ginger for better or wuss?
  Wid a tear and a sigh she said yes!
Den Ginger give Rosa a buss.
