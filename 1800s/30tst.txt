"The Soldier's Tear" (1830)
from "Music & Prejudice"
Words by Thomas Haynes Bayly, 1797-1829
Music by George Alexander Lee, 1802-1852

1.
Upon the hill he turn’d,
To take a last fond look
Of the valley and the village church,
And the cottage by the brook;
He listen’d to the sounds,
So familiar to his ear,
And the soldier leant upon his sword,
And wip’d away a tear.

2.
Beside that cottage porch
A girl was on her knees,
She held aloft a snowy scarf
Which flutter’d in the breeze;
She breath’d a pray’r for him,
A pray’r he could not hear,
But he paus’d to bless her as she knelt,
And wip’d away  a tear.

3.
He turn’d and left the spot
Oh! do not deem him weak,
For dauntless was the soldier’s heart,
Tho’ tears were on his cheek;
Go watch the foremost ranks
In danger’s dark career,
Be sure the hand most daring there
Has wip’d away a tear.
