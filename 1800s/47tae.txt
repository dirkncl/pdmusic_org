1. Harry Bluff when a boy left his friends and his home
And his dear native land o’er the ocean to roam
Like a sapling he sprung, he was fair to the view,
He was true yankee oak boys, the older he grew.
Though his body was weak, and his hands were so soft,
When the signal was giv’n he’s the first man aloft,
And the vet’rans all cried, he will one day lead the van,
Though he’s rated at a boy, he’s the soul of a man.

2. When promoted to manhood and burning for fame
Still in peace or in war Harry Bluff was the same.
So true to his love and in battle so brave
That the myrtle and laurel entwined o’er his grave.
For his country he fell when with victory crowned
The flag shot away, fell in tatters around.
And the foe thought he’d struck but he cried out avast
And the flag of Columbia he nailed to the mast.
