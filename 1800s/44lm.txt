1. Lovely maid the fields invite you 
let us taste the smiling morn 
let the warbling birds delight you 
chanting from the flow’ry thorn 

2. ’Twas not beauty’s smile that charmed me 
playing o’er thy dimpled face 
’twas no transient flame that warm’d me 
which can change with time or place 

3. Where the purling streams are flowing me 
the banks adorn’d with flow’rs 
lovely maid thy care foregoing 
let us chase these gloomy hours. 

4. ’Tis thy mental charms that bind me 
’twas thy virtue won my heart 
cast thy jealous cares behind thee 
bid thy boding fears depart. 

5. Sorrow grief and care should never dwell 
where love and faith reside 
time nor place our truth shall sever 
no rude hand our love divide 
no rude hand our love divide 
no rude hand our love divide.

6. Love that’s kindred by the graces 
some new passion may estrange 
but th’impression virtue traces 
time nor place shall ever change 
time nor place shall ever change 
time nor place shall ever change.
