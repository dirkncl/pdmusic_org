1.
Way down in Alabama, 
  Not bery long ago, 
I knew a yallow charmer, 
  And her name was Emma Snow.
Her eyes were bright as diamonds, 
  And her teeth were pearly white, 
And dey glisten’d in the darkness, 
  Like the stars do in the night.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
But the happy time is ober, 
I’ve only grief and pain, 
For I shall neber neber see 
My Emma Snow again.

2.
We used to go out early
  To hoe de sugar cane,
De time it pass so cheer’ly
  Whar my Emma Snow was seen,
And when our work was ober
  And de night had come again
We danc’d and sung so gaily
  To de banjo’s sweetest strain.

3.
But de happiest heart has sorrow,
  De brightest day has night,
And I lodt my lubly Emma
  By de pizen adders bite,
We missed her in de ebening
  And we hunted far and wide,
We found her in de meadow
  Whar she sicken’d and she died.
