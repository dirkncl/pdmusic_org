1. Tell me, ye winged winds that round my pathway roam, 
Do ye not know some spot, where mortals weep no more, 
Some lone and pleasant dell, some valley in the west, 
Where free from toil and pain, the weary soul may rest?

CHORUS 1
The loud winds dwindled to a whisper low 
And sighed for pity as it answered No! No!

2. Tell me, thou mighty deep whose billows round me play, 
Know’st thou some favored spot, some island far away, 
Where weary man may find the bliss for which he sighs, 
Where sorrow never lives, and friendship never dies?

CHORUS 2
The loud waves rolling in perpetual flow 
Stopped for a while and sighed to answer No! No!

3. And thou, ? ? ? person[?], with such holy face 
Don’t look upon the earth, asleep in might’s embrace;
Tell me in ? thy ?, hast thou not found some spot?
Where we meek wretched men may find a happier rest?

CHORUS 3
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe 
And a voice sweet but sad responded No! No!

4. Tell me my secret soul, oh! tell me hope and faith, 
Is there no resting place from sorrow, sin and death;
Is there no happy spot where mortals may be bless’d 
Where grief may find a balm, and weariness a rest?

CHORUS 4
Faith, Hope, and Love, best boons to mortals giv’n, 
Wav’d their bright wings and whisper’d, “Yes, in Heav’n.”
