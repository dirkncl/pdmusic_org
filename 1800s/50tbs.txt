1.
Bright Bird ah! why so loudly sing?
Ah! why? Ah why?
Thy notes make all the valleys ring,
Ah, why? Ah! why?
When buds bedeck the gladsome spring,
When summer fragrant blossoms bring,
I sing, I sing,
I sing I know not why.
La...

2.
Birdling! why sing in the forest wide?
Say, why? Say, why?
Call’st thou the Bridegroom or the Bride?
And why? And why?
“I call no Bridegroom— call no Bride,
Although I sing in forest wide—
Nor know, Nor know,
Nor know why I am singing.”

Sweet Bird your little heart seems glad,
Ah, why? Ah, why?
Sorrow ne’er comes to make thee sad,
Ah! why? Ah! why?
Why my heart’s full I cannot tell,
I ever feel some magic spell,
I sing! I sing! I sing but know not why.
I sing but know not why.
La...

4.
Birdling! why is thy heart so blest?
Oh, say! Oh, say?
Music o’erflowing from they breast?
Oh, say? Oh, say?
“My heart is full, and yet is light;
My heart is glad in day or night,
Nor know, Nor know, Nor know I why I’m singing.”
Nor know I why I’m singing.”

5.
Sweet Bird thou sing’st the long day thro’
Ah! why? Ah! why?
Hast thou some love who listens to thy song?
O! say? I sing while life is giv’n to me,
Careless if any hear or see,
I sing! I sing! I sing but know now why.
I sing but know not why.
La...

Birdling! why sing you all the day?
Oh, tell! Oh, tell!
Do any listen to thy lay?
Oh, tell? Oh, tell?
“I care not what my song may be;
Now this, not that— I warble free,
Nor know, Nor know,
Nor know, yet must be singing.
La...
