1. In Glasgow Town my Mither dwells, 
  As sure the Maidens ken, 
For oft her counsel warns the Girls, 
  O ne’er to trust the Men, 
But let her chide and call them bad, 
  the folk must all agree 
Blythe Sandy is a bonny lad, 
  Blythe Sandy is a bonny lad, 
And dearly he loves me. 
  Blythe Sandy is a bonny lad, 
And dearly he loves me, he does, 
  And dearly he loves me.

2. The other Morning from the Pair,
  My bonny Boy would bring—
A Snow white ribbon, for my Hair,
  A Plaid, and Golden Ring!
A Kiss he ask’d, a Kiss he had,
  How could I but agree,
For Sandy is a bonny lad,
  For Sandy is a bonny lad,
And dearly he loves me, 
  For Sandy is a bonny lad,
And dearly he loves me, he does,
  And dearly he loves me.

3. My Mither frowns to hear his Name,
  And calls me forward Elf;
But sure she canna, munna blame,
  At what she did herself
For Mither once was young, and glad,
  To wed— she must agree,
And so will I my bonny Lad,
  And so will I my bonny Lad,
For dearly he loves me,
  And so will I my bonny Lad,
For dearly he loves me, he does,
  For dearly he loves me..
