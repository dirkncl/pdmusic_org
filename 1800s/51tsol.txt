1.
The Star of Love now shines above
Cool zephyrs crisp the sea;
Among the leaves the wind-harp weaves,
Its serenade for thee!
The star, the breeze, the wave, the trees,
Their minstrelsy unite,
But all seems drear till thou appear,
To decorate the night!

[REFRAIN repeat after each verse]
Thou guiding star of love to me,
thou star, thou star, of love to me,
thou star of love, of love to me!

2.
The light of noon streams from the moon
Tho' with a milder ray;
O'er hill and grove like woman's love,
It cheers us on our way.
Thus all that's bright, the moon, the night,
The heav'ns, the earth, the sea,
Exert their pow'rs to bless the hours,
We dedicate to thee!
