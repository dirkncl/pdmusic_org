[1] Stars of the summer night! 
Far in yon azure deeps, 
Hide, hide your golden light! 
She sleeps! my lady sleeps! She sleeps! 

[2] Moon of the summer night! 
Far down yon western steeps, 
Sink, sink in silver light! 
She sleeps! my lady sleeps! She sleeps. 

[3] Wind od the summer night! 
Where yonder woodbine creeps, 
Fold, fold thy pinions light! 
Fold, fold thy pinions light! 
She sleeps! She sleeps! 
She sleeps, my lady sleeps. 

[4] Dreams of the summer night. 
Tell her, her lover keeps watch. 
Her lover keeps watch! 
while in slumbers light She sleeps! 
She sleeps! my lady sleeps, 
my lady sleeps, my lady sleeps, 
my lady sleeps! She sleeps!
