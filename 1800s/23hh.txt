1. Our Warrior hearts for Battle [burths (sp?)]
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
To Glory now our [?] we turn, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
Farewell to home and all its charms, 
We break from Love’s entwining arms, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

2. Behold! the enemy appears,—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
The din of battle fill our ears,—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
The bugles ring, the banners wave,
Each warrior grasps his shining glaive.—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

3. No more for fame; no more for gold,—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
The flag of battle we unfold,—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
United in a holy band,
For God and for our native land.—
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
