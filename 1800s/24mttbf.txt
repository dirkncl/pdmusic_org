1. March to the Battle field 
The foe is now before us 
Each heart is freedom’s shield 
And Heav’n is smiling o’er us 
The woes and pains 
The gaffing chains 
That keep our spirits under 
In proud disdain 
We’ve broke again 
And tore each link assunder 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
March to the Battle field 
The foe is now before us 
Each heart is freedom’s shield 
And Heav’n is smiling o’er us.

2. Who for his Country brave
Would fly from her lavader?
Who his ? live to wave
Would traiter like degrade her?
Our hallowed cause
Our home and laws
’Gainst tyrant power sustaining,
We’ll gain a crown
Of bright renown
Or die— our rights maintaining!
