1. White folks, I’m goin’ to sing
  A song dat am quite new
Of myself, an’ banjo string
  An’ you— an’ you— an’ you!
Oh, Sam, don’t laf, I say!
  Our strings will keep in tune!
Just listen to de fiddle play
  For de white folks round de room! 

[CHORUS sung twice after each VERSE]
Den commence, ye darkies all,
As loud as you can brawl!
Commence, ye darkies all, tonight!

2. Touch light de banjo string;
  An’ rattle de ole jawbone;
Oh, merrily sound de tambourine,
  An’ make dat fiddle hum!
An’ make dat fiddle hum, ole dad!
  De way dem bones will shake,
Am a caution to all living niggs,
  An’ a death to rattle snakes!

3. “O for a piano or guitar!
  I hear a fair one cry;
But when I hear dese instruments,
  I tink I’d like to die!
I tink I’d like to die, I does!
  I could lay me down to rest—
For music hab such ’lodious sounds
  “To soothe” dis darkey’s “breast!”
