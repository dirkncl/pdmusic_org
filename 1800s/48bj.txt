1. Gaily Black Jupiter, shoulder’d his hoe, 
Wen from de cornpatch, he homeward did go, 
Singing from hoeing corn, hithar I come, 
Lucy, lub, Lucy, lub, welcome me home!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Wid a linkey dinkey di do, 
Darkies hasten home. 
And we’ll hab a little dance, 
By de light ob de moon.

2. She for  Black Jupiter, good things kept hot,
Cow heel and hominey, bil’d in de pot,
While, as she swept de hearth, gaily she sung,
Jupiter, Jupiter, come to dy home!

3. Hark! dat was Jupiter, breavin her name,
Round by de hog pen, so softly he came,
Singing so gaily, de days work is done,
Lucy, lub, Lucy, lub, welcome me come!
