1. We parted in silence, we parted at night, 
On the banks of that lonely river, 
Where the fragrant pines, their boughs unite, 
We met and we parted for ever;
The night birds’ song and the stars above, 
Told many a touching story, 
Of friends long pass’d to the kingdom above, 
Where the soul wears its mantle of glory, 
Where the soul wears its mantle of glory.


2. We parted in silence, our cheeks were wet, 
With tears that were past controlling, 
And we vow’d that we’d never, no, never forget, 
And the vows at the time were consoling;
But the lips that echo’d the vow of mine, 
Are as cold as that lonely river, 
And the sparkling eye, the spirit’s shrine, 
Has shrowded its fire for ever, 
Has shrouded its fire for ever.

3. And now, on the midnight sky I look,
My heart grows full to weeping,
Each star to me is a sealed book,
Some tale of that lovely one keeping;
We parted in silence, we parted at night,
On the banks of that lonely river,
But the colour and bloom of the byegone years,
Shall hang o’er its waters forever,
Shall hang o’er its waters forever.
