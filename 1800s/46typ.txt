1. A storm arose on land and sea, 
Each billow dash’d most fearfully, 
As from the shore some Pilot’s brave 
Tempted the ocean’s swelling wave.
Among them was a cherish’d youth, 
Whose heart was full of love and truth;
A wife’s fond hope, a father’s pride, 
Was that lov’d one, who lately died.

2. How sad and awful in the storm,
The sight to them who saw the form
Struggling in vain ’mid wind and wave,
Failing, alas! himself to save.
But all is past! the scene is o’er!
No more he greets us on the shore!
Beneath the foam, in silent sleep,
Lies the young Pilot of the deep.
