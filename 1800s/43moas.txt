1. Agwine down to New Orleans I got upon de landin, 
I ran agin acotton bag, it foch me up a standin 
It’s alamode de duck soup, de corner ob an alley; 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 

O Sally, O Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 
Sally, Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
Ra re ri ro roun de corner Sally.

2. I as her, wont you take a ride wid me upon de lebby?
She jump up an crack her heels an swow dat she was ready,
I nebber spoke annudder word, nor shall I gib de reason
Why I lite on her ’fection for de balance ob de season.

De season, de season, my old aunt Sally, 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 
Sally, Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
Ra re ri ro roun de corner Sally.

3. I hitch de bull before de cart jus like a cleber feller,
Dea hit him a cut to make him go, de bull began to beller;
I turn aroun to look for Sall— I nebber shall forgetum,
Dar I see her makin track across de sandy bottom.

De bottom, de bottom, my old aunt Sally, 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 
Sally, Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
Ra re ri ro roun de corner Sally.

4. Up de hill an down de dale I didn’t seem to mind her,
De bull’s tail stick strat out as he keep up behind ’er,
He run slap agin a stump, an found hesef mistaken,
Sall she dodge on tudder side, an try to save her bacon.

Her bacon, her bacon, my old aunt Sally,

Ra re ri ro roun de corner Sally.

5. I brace my back agin de fence, de bull he look so sabbage,
Sez he old hoss I’l eat you up jis like I would a cabbage:
I softly creep up to him den jist like a nigger stealin, 
An lites upon him like a pig upon a tater peelin.

A peelin, a peelin, my old aunt Sally, 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 
Sally, Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
Ra re ri ro roun de corner Sally.

6. I gib her piece of my advice, to hunt some odder lodgin,
De bull keep gwine around de stump, an Sall she keep a dodgin,
She jump a nod or two aside, ye orter seen her bound it,
An if de bull haint broke de stump, he’s still a gwine round it.

Around it, around it, my old aunt Sally, 
I’ll tell you ob a scrape I had, wid my lubly Sally. 
Sally, Sally, my old aunt Sally, 
Ra re  ri ro roun de corner Sally.
