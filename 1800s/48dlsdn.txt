1. De lubly Sukey Dough Nut,

Den cook’d de possum in de fat, 
Dat cum from rattle snake;

Wid rake dat massa bought, 
And fri’d dem in de possom fat, 
Eb’ry one she cought.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dese be de joys ob de darkey’s life, 
In de little nigger hut he had a little wife, 
Dar you see dem dance to de banjo and de bones, 
Dey be happy all dar life.

2. And when dat Sambo cum home,

When Sukey wid de rake begin;
To comb his wooly head,

And try to run away;

And ebry one was fat.
