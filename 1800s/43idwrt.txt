In de wild Raccoon track at de break ob de morn,
'Tis de niggers pride by de Ribbers side.
We am led on de track by de howl ob de Coon

Dat howl to me when de Coon I see,
Makes de heart ob dis nigger bound.
I long to be climbing up dat tree
To pull de ole Coon down.

Her lips was white her eyes was brite,
Her voice was berry clar,
Her lips was big she could sing like a pig,
Her mouth stretch from ear to ear.
