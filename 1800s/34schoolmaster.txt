VERSE [1-5 for BASS Solo
with CHORUS (for 2-4) for Soprano and Alto]
1. Come, come my children, I must see,
How you can say your A B C,
Go get your books & hither come to me
And I will hear your E F G.
Hold up your heads and frighten’d don’t ye be
While you repeat to me your L M N O P.
Come, come my darlings now  let me see,
How well you know your U X Y & Z.

2. A B C D E F G

Don’t you be so much alarm’d
Don’t you cry you sha’n’t be harm’d
Don’t you laugh you rogue at me,
mind I say your A B C.
Else I will whip you and
send you out of school
For you are a naughty boy and
do not mind my rule.

3. No so, not so, not so, not so,
Bravo, bravo, bravo, boy, how
well you task you know.
Not so, not so,
not so stupid boy.
That’s right, ah! my dearest child you
are your mother’s joy.
Take good care, now, shut your books.
On your master fix your looks,
If you miss what e’er I tell you
And don’t say the words I spell you
Then I shall whip you and
beat you all around;
Silence, softly, silence, let me
not hear a sound.

4. B A B Bab; B E B Beb;
Ba be bi bo bu,
Ra re ri ro ru, C A

B I Bi; B O Bo;
L A B Lab; L E B Leb;
Na ne ni no nu,
Sa se what d’ye mean you rogue by
twisting off my cue.

5. Is it not a cruel fate a
master thus to be,
Doom’d to teach such naughty boys, such
blunder heads as these,
Ah! who knows my misery, or
half the pains endured
While my grief and troubles dire, I
know cannot be cured,
Nothing else be letters telling
Ruling books and had words spelling;
Pens a making, boys a shaking,
Reading writing, scolding, fighting,
Coazing on the stubborn ones, and
pushing on the lazy,
Toils like these are hard eenoug to
drive a poor man crazy.
