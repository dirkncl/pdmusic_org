1.
Dont you hear the banjo coming?
Dont you hear the banjo coming?
Dont you hear the banjo coming
  From de ole Virginny state
We're a family of niggers
We're a family of niggers
We're a family of niggers
  And our story we'll relate.

CHORUS
With a band of music
With a band of music
With a band of music
We are gwoing thro' de world.

2.
We have left our father Cuffee,
We have left our father Cuffee,
We have left our father Cuffee,
  In de ole Virginny state,
We've obtained his Banjo,
We've obtained his Banjo,
We've obtained his Banjo,
  And his old Jaw Bone.

CHORUS
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
  We are gwoing thro' de world.

3.
Dere is music in dis Nigger,
Dere is music in dis Nigger,
When he's gwoing de big figure
  On de old oak plank.
Your temper wouldn't ruffle,
Your applause you wouldn't muffle;
Did you see our double shuffle
  On de old oak plank.

CHORUS
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
  We are gwoing thro' de world.


4.
We hab Twenty Ichen Broders,
And Lebenteen Sisters,
And dere all as black as Niggers
  In ole Virginny state.
'Tis the tribe of Cuffee,
'Tis the tribe of Cuffee,
'Tis the tribe of Cuffee,
  And their names I relate.

CHORUS
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
  We will make the air resound.

5.
Caesar, Cuffee, Jake, and Josey,
Sambo, Pomp and Nigger Nosey,
Dandy Jim, Zip Coon, and Rosey
  And they're all wide awoke.
Rose and Dinnah both are pretty,
Lucy, Phillis, and Miss Kitty,
Ole Aunt Sarah she's so witty,
  About her there's no mistake.

CHORUS
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
  And our ole Jaw Bone.

6.
Uncle Gabriel plays de fiddle,
Zip Coon he makes de riddle,
Bone Squash in in de middle,
  And dis Nigger plays de bones,
While the Banjo and Triangle,
With the Cymbals jingle jangle,
And Big Drum so neat we handle,
  'Tis a sin to Uncle Jones.

CHORUS
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
With our band of music,
  We can make the air resound.

7.
Now three cheers altogether,
Now three cheers altogether,
Now three cheers altogether,
  For ole Virginny state.
Like de niggers gone before us,
We will swell de Chorus,
And de white folks will anchore us
  With a loud hurrah.
  Chah! Chah! Chah!

CHORUS
Like de niggers gone before us,
We will swell de Chorus,
Till the Heavens o'er us
  Will resound de loud Chah!
