1. Land of the south— imperial land!
  How proud thy mountains rise?
How sweet thy scenes on every hand!
  How fair thy cov’ring skies,
  How fair thy cov’ring skies!
But now for this— oh, not for these
  I love thy fields to roam—
Thou hast a dearer spell to me—
  Thou art my native home,
Thou has a dearer spell on me—
  Thou art my native home.

CHORUS 1-4. [with overlapping voices]
Thou art, thou art my native home.

2. Thy rivers roll their liquid wealth
  Unequaled to the sea—
Thy hills and valleys bloom with health
  And green with verdure be,
  And green with verdure be.
Yet not for thy proud ocean streams,
  Not for thine azure dome
Sweet sinny south I cling to thee—
  Thou art my native home,
Sweet sunny south I cling to thee—
  Thou art my native home.

3. And thou has prouder glories too
  Than nature ever gave—
Peace sheds o’er thee her genial dew
  And Freedom’s pimions wave.
  And Freedom’s pimions wave.
Fair science flings her pearls around,
  Religion lifts her dome:
These, these endear thee to my heart
  My own lov’c native home.
These, these endear thee to my heart
  My own lov’c native home.

4. Land of the south— imperial land!
  Then here’s a health to thee—
Long as thy mountain barriers stand
  May’st thou be blest and ffree.
  May’st thou be blest and free.
May dark dissension’s Banner ne’er
  Wave o’er thy fertile loam,
But should it come, here’s one would die
  To save his native home.
But should it come, here’s one would die
  To save his native home.
