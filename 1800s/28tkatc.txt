1. There was an old man in the west country,
A flaw in his lease the lawyers had found,
'Twas all about felling of five oak trees,
And building a house upon his own ground,

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Ri to, di nu, di nu, di nu, 
ri to, di ni no, ri to, di no, ri na.

2. Now this old chap to Lunnon would go
To tell the King a part of his grief,
Likewise to tell him a part of his woe,
In hopes King George would give him relief.

3. Now when this old chap to Lunnon had come,
He found the King to windsor had gone,
But if he'd known he'd not been at whoam,
He dang'd his buttons if ever he'd come.

4. Now this old chap to windsor did stump,
But the gates were barr'd and all secure;
So he rapp'd and he thump'd wi his oaken clump;
There be room for me withing I'm sure.

5. Pray Mr. Noble show I the King;
What, be that the King that I see there?
I've seen a chap in our village fair
Look more like a King that that chap there.

6. Pray Mr. King, and how do you do?
I've gotton for you a bit of a job;
Which if you'll be so kind as to do,
I've gotton a summat for you in my fob.

7. The King he took the Lease in hand,
And to sign it he were likewise willing;
And the farmer to make him a bit of amends,
He lugg'd out his poke and he giv'd him a shilling.

8. The King to carry on the joke,
He order'd ten pound to be laid down;
The farmer stared but nothing spoke,
He stared again & he scatch'd his crown.

9. The farmer stared and look'd wondrous funny,
But to pocket it he were likewise willing;
But if he'd ha known he'd got so much money,
He dang'd his buttons if he'd giv'n him that shilling.
