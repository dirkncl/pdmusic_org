1. Doth sorrow shade thy brow, Willie, 
Has gladness pass’d away; 
Has Mary’s grave no fonder thought 
Than her calmly sleeping clay? 
Oh! why upon the stile, Willie, 
Thy tears for me thus flow, 
When my marks the green rurf where my soul 
Its heav’nward pinions spread! 

And think not that the humble grave, Willie, 
Where Mary’s ashes lie 
If press’d by Willie’s gentle tread, 
Would yield one mournful sigh. 

If press’d by Willie’s gentle tread, 
Would yield one mournful sigh. 

Spirit’s plumed its angel wing 
From this earth of toil and woe 
When my spirit’s plumed its angel wing 
From this earth of toil and woe.

3. Oh! no, tho’ there, in sweet repose,
Thy Mary’s corpse may rest;
Her spirit, like a vesper star,
Shines brightly ’mid the blest.
Then press the sod where Mary sleeps,
In gentleness and love;
Her corpse, you ne’er may break its rest,—
Its soul is throned above.

4. Oh! happy was the festive morn,
When I thy bosom prest;
When, wedded to my Willie’s love,
I thought all bliss possest;
An infant, too,— its youngday smile
Was joyous to my heart;—
Ah! my baby’s love, with Willie’s joined,
Was far too much to part!

5. Nor long I slept alone, Willie,
For my infant’s spirit fled;
And Mary, with her blighted babe,
Laid silent with the dead.
But the rose you planted there, Willie,
Like that ou spirits bloom,
Then blissful be thy visions when
You kneel by Mary’s tomb.

6. Though Erin’s shores you leave, Willie,
An angel follows thee;
Thy baby’s spirit linked with mine,
Shall watch thee o’er the sea;
And when beneath the stranger’s sod
Thy wearied form shall lie,
Our triune shade will peaceful seek
Its home beyond the sky.
