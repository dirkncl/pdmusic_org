"Are There Tidings?" (1835)
The Words and Melody by
Thomas Haynes Bayley, Esq.
Arranged as a Duetto, with an Accompaniment
for the Piano Forte
by Charles Edward Horn, 1786-1849.

1.
Are there tidings in yon vessel,
Prouldly bounding o're the wave,
Are there tidings for a mother,
Who is mourning for the brave
  No No No No,
She is freighted with fond tidings
But no tidings from the grave -- from the grave.

2.
Do not ask me why I hasten,
To each vessel that appears,
Why I seem to cling so wildly,
To one cherished hope for years
  No No No No,
Tho my search prove unavailing
What have I to do with tears -- do with tears.

3.
Do no blame me when I seek him,
With these wan and weary eyes
Can you tell me where he perished,
Can you show me where he lies
  No No No No,
Yet there surely is some record
When a brave young hero dies -- hero dies.

4.
Had I watched beside his pillow,
Had I seen him on his bier,
Oh I must have died of weeping,
  No No No No,
Let me still think I shall see him,
Let me still think he is near -- he is near.
