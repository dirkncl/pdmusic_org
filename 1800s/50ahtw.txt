1.
A hundred thousand welcomes!
And 'tis time that you should come,
From the far land of the stranger,
To your country and your home.
Oh! long as we were parted--
Ever since you went away,
I never pass'd a dreamless night
Or knew a happy day.
Do you think I will reproach you
With the sorrows that I bore?
Sure the sorrow is all over;
Now I have you here once more.
And there's nothing but the gladness
And the love within my heart,
And the hope so sweet and certain,
That again we'll never part.

2.
Did the strangers come around ye,
With true heart and loving hand?
Did they comfort and console ye,
When ye sicken'd in their land?
Had they pleasant smiles to court ye
And silver words to bind?
Had they hearts more fond and loyal,
Than the hearts ye left behind?
We'll never leave my darlings--
There's a promise in your eye;
I will tend you while I'm living--
Ye will watch me when I die;
And if death but kindly lead me
To the Heav'nly Home so fair
Full a hundred thousand welcomes
Shall await you darlings there.
