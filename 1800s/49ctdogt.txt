1.
[CHORUS]
Come to de ole Gum Tree,
  Whar de Coon and Possum prance,
Oh come you darkies wid me
  And join in de jovial dance.
[SOLO]
De Coon he is above us,
  His meat is in de tree,
We know dat he dont love us,
  But fond of him are we.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come to de ole Gum Tree,
  Whar de Coon and Possum prance,
Oh come you darkies wid me
 And join in de jovial dance.

2. 
[CHORUS]
Oh de wood and its yaller leaves,
  Oh de cotton plants and flowers;
Den come you darkies wid us,
  For a merry life is ours;
[SOLO]
Around us and above us,
  De banjo's seetest notes
And de voices ob de darkies
  Come rolling from dar throats:

3.
[CHORUS]
Come to de ole oak tree,
  So softly boys as you can;
And we'll go to de Ole Gum Tree,
  And cotch dat coon if we can.
[SOLO]
Dat darky plays de fiddle,
  And I de tambourine;
We're de happiest set of darkies,
  Dat ever 'fore was seen.
