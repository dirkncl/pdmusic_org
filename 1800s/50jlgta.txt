1.
I greet with a full heart the land of the west,
Whose banner of stars o'er the world is unroll'd;
Whose [missing words]
sunset its gateway of gold.
The land of the mountain, the land of the lake
And river roll in magnificent tide.
That roll in magnificent tide.
Where the souls of the mighty from slumber awake
And hallow the soil for whose freedom they died.

2.
Thou cradle of Empire! though wide be the foam
That severs the land of my fathers and thee;
I hear from thy bosom the welcome of home,
For song has a home in the hearts of the free!
And long as thy waters shall gleam in the sun,
And long as thy heroes remember their scars.
Thy heroes remember their scars.
Be the hands of thy children united as one,
And peace shed her light on thy banner of stars.
