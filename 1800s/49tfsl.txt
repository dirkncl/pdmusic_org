1. My poor old, Massa’s dead and gone, 
He’s left me wid my Child alone, 
Oh! what will be our fate tomorrow at the selling Mart? 
For should we get anodder Boss, 
Who’ll treat us roughly when he’s cross, 
De thoughts ob former kindness, 
It would surely break my heart. 
De fatal day did now arrive, 
Dat placed us on de stand. 
Dar I was sold from my dear child, 
Unto a stranger man.

[sung after each verse]
TRIO
We hope again you’ll meet your child, 
On dat and face to see a smile, 
Where grief and pain has almost broke, 
Your sad and aching heart. 
CHORUS
May Providence good fortune send you 
All kind Massa’s will befriend you 
trust to fate and lib in hope, 
Ob happier days to come.

2. Oh I was sent to old Virginny 
Parted from my piccaninny, 
Oh what dreadful thoughts do sometimes flash across my brain, 
I fear when sick dey’ll ill treat him, 
Oberseer’s may cruelly beat him, 
Someting tells me in my heart 
Dat we’ll neber meet again. 
But dere is one who rules above, 
Will guide de poor Slaves fate. 
Till we all meet at his great throne, 
Our actions to relate.
