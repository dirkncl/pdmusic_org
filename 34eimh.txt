1. Oh I have roved many lands,
  And many friends I've met,
Not one fair scene or kindly smile,
  Can this fond heart forget,
But I'll confess that leaving them,
  No more I wish to roam,
Oh steer my barque to Erin's Isle,
  For Erin is my Home!
Oh steer my barque to Erin's Isle,
  For Erin is my Home!

2.
If England were my place of birth,
  I'd love her tranquil shore,
And if _Columbia_ were my home
  Her freedom I'd adore.
Though pleasant days in both I pass,
  I dream of days to come,
Oh steer my barque to Erin's Isle,
  For Erin is my Home!
Oh steer my barque to Erin's Isle,
  For Erin is my Home!
