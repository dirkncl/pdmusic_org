1. It oft was told me by my Dad,
When I was young and but a Lad;
How many wondrous things he saw,
Done by our Old Tom Cat.

[REFRAIN repeat after each verse]
Meough, meough, meough.
When he march'd out of the Ash Hole,
He march'd out, meough, meough,
Our Old Tom Cat meough'd,
When he march'd out of the Ash Hole.

2. It was Tom's place of birth, he said,
And ev'ry night it was Tom's bed;
For rats and mice were banish'd hence,
Done by our Old Tom Cat.

3. Tom thought he would not live alone,
So a Kitten he stole and brought it home;
A beautiful creature it was I say,
Just like our Old Tom Cat.

4. This Kitten grew up under Old Tom's care,
And many a Kitten he had to spare;
For twelve generations he liv'd to see,
Just like our Old Tom Cat.

5. Tom was a musician, and taught the same,
If they didn't learn, he was not to blame;
For all kind of Instruments, they did play,
Made by our Old Tom Cat.

6. In his merry mood, great concerts he gave,
I've oft been delighted with voices so grave;
With Cymbals and Trumpets, and Double Bass Drums,
Play'd by our Old Tom Cat.

7. Now Tom was Col. of a rigyment brave,
He'd march out his soldiers, his Ash Hole to save;
With a Brass Band, superior to all in the town,
Made by our Old Tom Cat.

8. In Battle Tome always was head of his Clan,
He fought like a Hero, and died like a manl
They retreated in order into the Ash Hole,
To mourn over our Tom Cat.

9. Now poor Tom is dead and gone,
He lay in the Ash Hole there till morn;
His will was made, and legacies left,
Done by our Old Tom Cat.

10. They buried Old Tom, with honors or war,
Then return'd to the Ash Hole, their sorrows to pour;
When lo, in a moment, a voice was heard,
Done by our Old Tom Cat.
