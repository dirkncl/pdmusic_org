1. There’s a lone and lovely Isle, love, 
Begirt by the bounding Sea;
And there the sun sweetly shines, love, 
Oh! come to that Isle with me, 
Oh! come with me, Come with me, 
Oh! come to that Isle with me.
There’s a streamlet on that Isle, love, 
Whose waters glide gently on;
On its banks Oh! let us wander, 
And sing of the days that are gone, 
And sing of the days  that are gone.
Oh! Come with me, Come with me, 
Oh! Come to that Isle with me.

2. ’Tis an Isle of love and beauty, 
Where fond hearts are entwined 
Like the boughs among its bowers, 
Where true love is enshrined 
Oh! come with me, Come with me, 
Oh! Come to that Isle with me.
My Gondola soon will carry you 
O’er the gentle waters tide 
And the ripling wave will echo love, 
“Wilt thou, wilt thou be me bride?
Wilt thou, wilt thou be me bride?” 
Oh! come with me, come with me, 
Oh! Come to that Isle with me.
