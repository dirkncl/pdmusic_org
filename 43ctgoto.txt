1.
O Columbia! the gem of the ocean,
  The home of the brave and the free,
The [?] of [?] patriot's devotion,
  A world offers homage to thee.
Thy [?-?] make [?-? ?-?-?],
  When Liberty's form stands in view,
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,
  When borne by the red, white and blue,
  When borne by the red, white and blue,
  When borne by the red, white and blue,
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,
  When borne by the red, white and blue.

2.
When war winged its wide desolation,
  And threatened the land to deform,
The ark then of freedom's foundation,
  Columbia, rode safe through the storm;
With her garlands of viet'ry around her,
  When so proudly she born her brave crew,
With her flag proudly floating before her,
  The boast of the red, white and blue,
  The boast of the red, white and blue,
  The boast of the red, white and blue,
With her flag proudly floating before her,
  The boast of the red, white and blue.

3.
The wine-cup, the wine-cup bring hither,
  And fill you it true to the brim!
May the wreathe they have won never wither,
  Nor the star of their glory grow dim!
May the service united ne'er sever,
  But they to their colours prove true!
The Army and Navy forever,
  Three cheers for the red, white and blue!
  Three cheers for the red, white and blue!
  Three cheers for the red, white and blue!
The Army and Navy forever,
  Three cheers for the red, white and blue!
