1. On the death of the three little Pigs, 
Who all died of “felodese,” 
Their mother, the sow, thought well over bow 
She might easiest learn to say “wee!” 
	She might easiest learn to say “wee!” 

2. Her children were dead, as I’ve said, 
And had slipt from her old memory; 
So she wink’d her old eye, as she thought in her sty; 
I know of a plan to say, “wee!” 
	I know of a plan to say, “wee!” 

3. My children tried fasting too hard, 
But they got as near “umph¨ as could br, 
So the moral of that is  that I must get fat 
If I mean to learn how to say “wee!” 
	If I mean to learn how to say “wee!” 

4. This old Lady sow was so vain, 
She wish’d to look young like a girl, 
So this silly old pig grew a regular prig 
And put her old tail into curl, 
	And put her old tail into curl.

5. Said Piggy: I have to grow fat
Yet I must not be ugly you see
’Tis a rule of good taste to be thin in the waist
So I’ll pinch, and still learn to say “wee!” 
	So I’ll pinch, and still learn to say “wee!” 

6. Then she ate and grew fat, but she pinch’d
’Till her eyes started out of her head
Yet you know she was vain, so she stifled the pain,
But her nose grew enormously red, 
	But her nose grew enormously red. 

7. Each day her old voice fainter grew
She almost had learnt to say “wee”
But she pinch’d to look “fast,” and this kill’d her at last
In a spasm of apolplexy, 
	In a spasm of apolplexy. 

8. We all have a weak point you know
And so had the sow as you see
There’s a moral not long for all in this song
Don’t try when you’re old to say “wee!” 
	Don’t try when you’re old to say “wee!”
