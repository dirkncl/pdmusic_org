What is this day that it should give
Such life and joy to me?
And why betray, my beating heart,
The love it holds for thee.
Ah, 'tis Saint Anna's,
Saint Anna's, Saint Anna's;
No sweeter day I know,
The flight of time can show.
Anna to thee I fondly cling,
I fondly cling, I fondly cling,
Anna to thee my song I sing,
my song I sing, my song I sing;
Nanon, Nanetta, thy name I love,
thy name I love, thy name I love;
Long as I live my ways shall prove,
Thee, I only love.

||: Nanon thee I fondly cling,
fondly cling, fondly cling,
Nanon to thee my song I sing,
Nanon to thee, my song I sing. :||
