1.
This Land of ours, this mighty Land!
Of hills and valleys, lakes and seas;
Is there on earth a spot as grand--
The boast of fairer scenes than these.
Wild prairies spread o'er western wilds,
High mountains bloom with native flow'rs
And not a spot on earth excels,
The grandeur of this Land of ours.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
This Land of ours, this mighty Land,
How great its native glory.
With hearts that pride to boast its worth,
And tell its noble story.

2.
This Land of ours, where ev'ry heart
Is free from dark oppression's sting;
For ev'ry woman is a queen,
And ev'ry man himself a king.
Who can forget-- tho' forced by fate,
Across the wide, wide world to roam,
The hands that fought, the hearts that bled,
That we might claim it as a home.
