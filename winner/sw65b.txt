"Carry My Back to Tennesse; or Ellie Rhee" (1865)
As Sung by Carter's Zouave Troupe.
Adapted and arranged by Septimus Winner.

1.
Sweet Ellie Rhee so dear to me
  Is lost forever more;
Our home was down in Tennessee,
  Before dis cruel war.

[REFRAIN]
Then carry me back to Tennessee,
  Back where I long to be.
Among the fields of yellow corn;
  To my darling Ellie Rhee.

CHORUS
Then carry me back to Tennessee,
  Back where I long to be.
Among the fields of yellow corn;
  To my darling Ellie Rhee.

2.
Oh why did I from day to day,
  Keep wishing to be free,
And from my massa run away,
  And leave my Ellie Rhee

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
They said that I would soon be free
  And happy all the day,
But if dey take me back again
  I'll neber run away.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
The war is over now at last,
  De color'd race am free,
Dat good time comin' on so fast;
  I'm waitin' for to see.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
