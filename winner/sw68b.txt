Dedicated to Master Frank Dixey Winner
"Ten Little Injuns" (1866)
by Septimus Winner
Comic Song and Chorus
Sung with Immense Applause by
Mr. E. F. Dixey

1.
Ten little "Injuns" standin' in a line,
One toddles home and then there were nine;
Nine little "Injuns" swingin' on a gate,
One tumbled off and then there were eight.

1st CHORUS
One little, two little, three little, four little,
five little "Injun" boys;
Six little, seven little, eight little, nine little,
ten little "Injun" boys.

2.
Eight little "Injuns" never heard of heav'n,
One "kick'd the bucket" and then there were seven;
Seven little "Injuns" cuttin' up their tricks,
One broke his neck and then there were six.

(1st CHORUS)

3.
Six little "Injuns" kickin' all alive,
One went to sleep and then there were five;
Five little "Injuns" on a cellardoor,
One tumbles in and then there were four.

(1st CHORUS)

4.
Four little "Injuns" out upon a spree,
One dead drunk and then there were three;
Three little "Injuns" out in a canoe,
One tumbles overboard and then there were two.

(1st CHORUS)

5.
Two little "Injuns" foolin' with a gun,
One shot t'other and then there was one;
One little "Injun" livin' all alone,
He got married and then there was none.

(1st CHORUS)

6. [ENCORE Verse]
This little "Injun" with his little wife,
Lived in a wigwam the balance of his life;
One daddy "Injun" and a mommy "Squaw"
Brought up a family of Ten "Injun" more.

2nd CHORUS
One little, two little, three little, four little,
five little "Injun" more;
Six little, seven little, eight little, nine little,
ten little "Injun" more.
