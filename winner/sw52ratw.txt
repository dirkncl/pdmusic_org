duced to Publish the following Ballad; hoping it may meet with a
favorable reception, I earnestly request those who purchase the same

tinue the Publication of an anticipated Series.

1.
She came in the twilight that cometh 'ere night,
  And beautifies earth at the close of the day;
She came with a footstep unburden'd and tight,
  To fill from the well her frail pitcher of clay:
Alone and unheeded she silently came,
  And fill'd from the waters her vessel once more,
Ne'er dreaming of one who should lead her to claim
  A home where she never had wander'd before.

2.
They met-- and he told her of scenes far away,
  Of home, and of all that was bright to the eye,
Of herds and of flocks, and the happy display
  Of all that would charm her beneath its far sky.
He told her of those who should come at her call,
  Of servants and camels to wait at her side;
And then of a heart she should prize above all,
  And claim with a passion of friendship and pride.

3.
He gave to her then the fair gifts he had brought,
  And breathed with devotion his mastr's own pray'r,
'Till charm'd by the scene of each beautiful thought,
  She cried, "I will follow thee, follow thee there."
The home of her youth and the pleasures that live,
  Where the heart in its childhood first greeteth its days,
With all its endearments-- the joys it could give,
  She left, for the soul that awaited her gaze.
