1.
I would not die away from home,
  From all my heart holds dear,
From friends belov'd far, far away,
  Without a word of cheer;
    From friends belov'd far, far away,
    Without a word of cheer.

REFRAIN
I would not die away from home,
  From all my heart holds dear,
From friends belov'd far, far away,
  Without a word of cheer.

2.
O let me die beneath the roof
  I honor as my home,
That I may be with those I love,
  When death's dark shadows come;
    That I may be with those I love,
    When death's dark shadows come.

(REFRAIN)

3.
O let me rest beneath the sod,
  Near those I used to love;
Beside the old folks, gone before,
  To better realms above.
    Beside the old folks, gone before,
    To better realms above.

(REFRAIN)
