To Fancis E. Harding Esq.
"Our Good Old Friends" (1855)
As Sung by Joseph H. Rainer Esq.
Composed by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
(aka "Alice Hawthorne")

1.
When I dream of the friends of my youth,
And the hearts that were dear to me then,
  I turn with a sigh
  To the days gone by,
Yet I love to recall them again;

When I dream of the joys that then were mine,
Of the hearts that were gentle and true;
  My heart still bends,
  To my good old friends,
And I sigh when I bid them adieu.

CHORUS
My heart still bends to my good old friends,
To my good old friends of yore,
  And I turn with a sigh
  To the days gone by,
And the hearts that shall meet me no more.

2.
When I think of a mother so kind,
And the hearth to my childhood so dear;
  Where ever I roam,
  I dream of that home
With a sigh that will melt to a tear;

When I think of the hand that led me forth,
And the footsteps that follow'd mine own,
The eyes that smiled,
When they called me a child,
And have faded and left me alone.

(CHORUS)
