1.
No one to weep when I am gone,
No one to care for such as me;
No one to weep and no one to mourn,
No one to sigh my fate to see.
No one to place beside my grave,
Some little flower -- as pledge of love;
Only the soft, green grass to wave,
Under the eye of Him above.

CHORUS
No one to weep when I am gone
No one to grieve for few have smiled
No one to weep and no one to mourn
No one to care for a poor lone child.

2.
Over my grave the birds may sing,
Ever, alas! the whole day long,
Never again to waken me;
Never to hear their sweet, low song.
Under the sod my rest will be,
Lonely and still -- apart from all;
Gone to the charge of Him who sees
Even the tiny sparrow's fall.

(CHORUS)
