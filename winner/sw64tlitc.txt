1.
A story I'll relate to you
Took place the other day
As in the railroad cars by chance
I started on my way
Just as I took my seat among
The daughter's, son's and ma's
The door was open'd to admit
A lady in the cars.

CHORUS
She dress'd so neat
She look'd so sweet
Her eyes were bright as stars
This lovely girl I chanc'd to meet
While riding in the cars.

2.
Her face was pretty yet her form
Was bent as tho' in pain
But when she settled in her seat
She straightened out again
The trouble was my honest friend
I'll bet my best segars
She tried to make the Grecian Bend
That lady in the cars.

(CHORUS)

3.
She sat beside me to the left
A smile was on her face
The whistle blew and all I heard
We started from the place
Look where I would look where I could
From daughter's to their ma's
I could not keep my eyes from off
That lady in the cars.

(CHORUS)

4.
Now I was drest all in my best
  With clothes so neat and fine
But on my face wore a moustache
  Alas! that was not mine
We near'd a tunnel, brave I sat
  As any son of Mars,
And as the darkness came I kiss'd
  That lady in the cars.

(CHORUS)

5.
When from the tunnel we emerged
  Right into broad daylight
Oh dear! will ever I forget
  The thing that met my sight?
The car was full, and passengers
  Gave vent to loud Ha ha's
For my moustache was sticking fast
  To that lady of the cars.

(CHORUS)

6.
Now Gents, I pray a warning take
  Or else like me you'll rue it
Don't wear a moustache on you face
  Unless kind nature grew it.
For ne'er can I forget the time
  I wish'd myself afar,
The day I lost my false moustache
  On that lady in the car.

(CHORUS)
