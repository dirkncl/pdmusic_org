"God Bless the Little Feet" (1871)
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
God bless the little feet that come
To meet us at the door,
To welcome our return at home,
When day at last is o'er.
Oh may they never go astray
From those beloved best, Ah---
But in their happy fold at home,
Contented be at rest.

CHORUS
God bless the little feet that walk
In virtue's spotless way
Oh may they ever keep the path,
Nor erring go astray.

2.
God bless the pretty eyes that smile
When gazing on our face,
The little hands that fondly reach
To take our kind embrace.
Oh bless the heart that leaps with joy
Which words can never tell
To share the comfort that we own,
When life and all goes well.

(CHORUS)

3.
God bless the little lips that turn
To meet us with a kiss,
When trouble like a cloud o'er hangs,
Our little share of bliss.
Oh may they never fail to bless,
And cheer us to the last
When time hath made our pleasures less,
And years their shadows cast.

(CHORUS)
