1.
'Twere better that words were unspoken
  That wound or distress the fond heart
Than friendship at last should be broken.
  And near ones and dear ones should part;
For sweet are the scenes that surround us
  And cheer us if but for a day.
And why! when a true heart hath found us
  Should coldness drive friendship away.
    And why! when a true heart hath found us
    Should coldness drive friendship away.


2.
Our lips may be tardy to utter
  The truth that we long to unfold
But time should teach them to mutter
  One sentence unkindly and cold.
For what is the dew to the flower
  If frozen upon its frail leaf.
Or what is the joy of an hour
  If followed by moments of grief.
    Or what is the joy of an hour
    If followed by moments of grief.

3.
I would not, I could not distress thee,
  The friendship I pledge is sincere;
Oh, how could I ever but bless thee,
  So gentle, so kind, and so dear.
The world may be dreary before thee,
  Tho' bright be the dreams of the past,
Then give me thy trust I implore thee,
  And all will be well at the last.
    Then give me thy trust I implore thee,
    And all will be well at the last.
