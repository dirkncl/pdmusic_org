"Out of Work!" (1877)
(New Sensation Ballad)
Song and Chorus
Words and Music by
Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
(aka Percy Guyer)

1.
Out of work without a penny,
  Out of heart without a friend,
Seeking one among the many,
  With a helping hand to lend,
I have trod the country over,
  I have sought the city through,
Drive me not away in anger,
  For there's nothing now to do.

CHORUS
Out of work without a penny,
  Pleading help before thy door,
Without friends among the many,
  Look with pity upon the poor.

2.
I have babes that watch my coming,
  Children crying now for bread,
Oh then chide me not for roaming,
  They are waiting to be fed,
In an attic cold and dreary,
  They are weeping side by side,
For their sake I grow not weary,
  Pray then help me to provide.

(CHORUS)

3.
Must I look in vain for pity
  From the hearts on which I call?
Must I starve in this great city
  Where there's food enough for all?
Must I wander sad and lonely
  Like an out-cast, day by day?
Give me but thy favor only:--
  Drive me not, my friends, away.

(CHORUS)
