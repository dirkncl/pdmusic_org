It's nice to be a father of either girl or boy, 
Oh it's nice to be a parient, now don't you wish me joy? 
For I am so fond of music I could listen all the day 
Espec'ly when my Charlie cries so 
Oft in the stilly night ere slumber's chain hath bound me 
After the Op'ra is over 
Attending the ladies is done, 
After the Op'ra is over 
Commences the cholic and fun. 
Till the midnight hour is past and gone or it's 
Five o'clock in the morning 
Then it's goodbye Charlie for another day. 
Write me a letter love 
Send me a letter love 
Dawn is a coal mine underneath the ground, 
For I wont be home till morning 
I wont be home till morning 
I wont be home till morning 
Till Cap-tain Ginks of the Horse marines 
has fed his beast on corn and beans 
Which is of course beyond my means 
Tho' Captain in the army, 
And if I fall a fighting  
Upon the battle plain, 
I hope some other chap 
will come and make my grave 
'neath the wildwood shade 
Where Maxwelton's braes are Bonnie 
Down where the woodbine twineth. 
And to a soldier's resting place 
Some little tribute bear 
Ere the last rose of summer is blooming a lone.
