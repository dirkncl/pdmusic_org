1.
Away down in Dixie the war first begun,
Way down at Fort Sumpter, with Major Anderson;
He stood by the flag with a heart brave and true,
And fought like a man for the Red, White and Blue.

CHORUS
Then hoist up the flag, long may it wave,
Over the Union our honor to save;
Up with the flag and long may it wave,
Over the Union, the home of the brave.

2.
Twas there teh Seccession first started the war.
They shot down our soldiers in the streets of Baltimore.
And Ellsworth was slain when he tore down the rag,
The Rebels had raised for a Jeff Davis flag.

(CHORUS)

3.
Then down on an island we call Roanoke,
Our men had a battle that rais'd a big smoke,
Our boys fought away to the rebels suprise,
Till they all ran away after Govener Wise.

(CHORUS)

4.
Again, down by Norfolk, we drove the foe back,
And fought 7 hours with the big Merrimac,
The old Monitor went a hobbling around,
And drove her about till she run her aground.

(CHORUS)

5.
Old England is trying to kick up a fuss,.
We think they had better no interfere with us,
If they come to fight, they will find it no fun,
They'll get what they got from Gen'l Washington.

(CHORUS)

6.
Our troups are the finest the world ever saw.
Our men are the bravest that e'er went to war.
Our land is the best where e'er you may go.
The boys they are fast and the girls are not slow.

(CHORUS)

7.
We'll fight for the Union, but just as it was,
Not care what Succesh or Abolition does,
We'll stand by the flag, the sword and the gun,
To save from dishonor the land of Washington.

(CHORUS)
