1.
I sit by my window that faces the west
In my little sky parlor up under the eaves;
The day it is rough, but my heart is at rest,
As the rain patters down on the wet, surging leaves,
For I hold in my bosom a letter from home,
That gives to my heart a sweet, comforting spell;
It tells me, tho' far from my friends I may roam,
I still am remember'd, and all, too, is well.

CHORUS
Under the eaves, (Uner the eaves,)
 under the eaves, (under the eaves,)
Watching the rain on the wet, surging leaves,
And dreaming of home with a half-smaother'd sigh;
Thinking of those I shall meet by and by.

2.
I've found many hearts in my journey along,
Who have welcomed my steps to the comforts they own.
Their words have been friendly, and cheerful their song,
To me as a stranger way and alone,
And of, I rejoice in my spirit today,
That life is so sweet in my loneliness here,
I seem to forget that I roam far away
From those whom I love and the hearts I hold dear.

(CHORUS)
