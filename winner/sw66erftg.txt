1.
Sweet Ellie Rhee so dear to me
  Is lost forever more;
Our home was down in Tennessee,
  Before dis cruel war.

REFRAIN and CHORUS
Then carry me back to Tennessee,
  Back where I long to be,
Among the fields of yellow corn;
  To my darling Ellie Rhee.

2.
Oh why did I from day to day,
  Keep wishing to be free,
And from my massa run away,
  And leave me Ellie Rhee.

(REFRAIN and CHORUS)

3.
They said I would roam be free
  And happy all de day,
But if dey take me back again
  I'll neber run away.

(REFRAIN and CHORUS)

4.
The way is over now at last,
  De color'd race am free,
Dat good time comin' on so fast;
  I'se waitin' for to see.

(REFRAIN and CHORUS)
