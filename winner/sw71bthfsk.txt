No. 1 "Blow the Horn for Supper Kate" (1871)
(Song & Chorus)

[Source: 07979@LoC]

1.
Blow the horn for supper Kate,
Tea is ready for the men.
The day is done, it's growing late,
Bring the reapers home again.
When the frugal meal is o'er,
The cattle home, the bird and bee
On the porch beside the door
Let them rest from labor free.
Then

CHORUS
Blow the horn for supper Kate,
Tea is ready for the men;
Blow the horn for supper Kate,
And bring the reaper's home again.

2.
Blow the horn for supper Kate,
Call the men and boys to tea,
For soon they'll reach the gardern gate,
Weary tho' they well may be.
When the sun at last is set,
The kine at rest 'till early dawn,
'Ere the grass with dew be wet,
Let us seek the cosy lawn,
Then

(CHORUS)
