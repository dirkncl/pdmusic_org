1.
If in this world there is a flow'r
  To me more lovely than the rest,
It is the rose the pale white rose
  The snow-white rose I love the best.
But why this flow'r so dear to me?
  Why to my heart such pleasure send?
Because it was the fond gift
  Of one who ever is my friend,
Because it was the fond gift
  Of one who ever is my friend.

2.
And now when spring is on her way,
  When flow'rs with their perfume abound,
I seek the grove and love to dwell
  Where-e'er the snow-white rose is found.
But why this flow'r so dear to me?
  Why to my heart such pleasure send?
Because it was the fond gift
  Of one who ever is my friend,
Because it was the fond gift
  Of one who ever is my friend.

3.
What-e'er my heart may learn to prize
  'Till life shall meet its certain close;
I know I ne'er shall cease to love
  The beauty of the snow-white rose.
For oh, this flow'r so dear to me
  So sweet, so fair to view,
I love because it was the gift
  Of one whose heart is ever true,
I love because it was the gift
  Of one whose heart is ever true.
