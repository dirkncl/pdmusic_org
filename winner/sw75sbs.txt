1.
We were our at eventide, and the sky was rosy red,
All the earth was bright and fair underfoot and overhead,
Oh, our life seem'd like a dream, and our pathway fair and wide,
For our hearts were happy ever as we wander'd side by side;
But the darkness soon came on, and the bright clouds sped away,
Till the twilight tints were gone, and the night succeeded day,
Oh our life seem'd as a dream and our pathway fair and wide,
For our hearts were happy ever as we wander'd side by side.

2.
Oh, how many years have gone, since that sunny time hath fled,
When a smile could give us joy, tho' no loving words were said,
Oh, how changed is all the scene; e'en my locks are thin and gray
And our feet no more together tread that path across the way;
For my early mate is gone, I remember when she died!
And I know 'twill not be long e'er were resting side by side,
Oh, how changed is all the scene; e'en my locks are thin and gray
And our feet no more together tread that path across the way.

3.
Nevermore, ah nevermore does the green grass look half so green,
Nor the sky at eventide, near as bright, as it hath been,
For there's nothing as of old, since my fond companion died,
And I'm waiting, ready waiting, to be resting side by side;
Let the chilly Winter come, or the sunny Summer shine,
It is all the same to me--to this lonely heart of mine;
For there's nothing as of old, since my fond companion died,
And I'm waiting, ready waiting, to be resting side by side;
