1. I trace these gardens o’er and o’er,
Meditate on each sweet flow’r,
Thinking of each happy hour
Oh Johnny is gone for a Soldier.

CHORUS 1-5.
Schoola Shoola Shool agrah,
Time can only heal my woe,
Since the lad of my heart from me did go,
Oh, Johnmy is gone for a Soldier.

2. Some say my love is gone to France,
There his fortune to advance,
And if I find him it’s but a chance,
Oh! Johnny is gone for a Soldier.

3. I’ll sell my frock, I’ll sell my wheel,
I’ll buy my love a sword of steel,
So in the battle he may reel,
Oh, Johnmy is gone for a Soldier.

4. I wish I was on yonder hill,
It’s there I’d sit and cry my fill,
So ev’ ry tear might turn a mill,
Oh, Johnny is gone for a Soldier.

5. I’ll dye my dress all over red,
And o’er the world I’ll beg my bread,
So all my friend may think me dead,
Oh Johnny is gone for a Soldier.
