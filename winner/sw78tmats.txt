1.
[Maid. (Alto)]
Little Sparrow why so shy?
Do not always from my fly;
Come and stay at home with me,
I will take good care of thee.
[Sparrow. (Soprano)]
Oh, no, no, I think it best,
In my snug and cosy nest,
With my little mate to share,
For we are a happy pair.

2.
[Maid.]
Oh you naughty naughty bird!
'Tis not true a single word,
I've a golden cage and nest,
Do not think your own the best.
[Sparrow.]
Golden cage can ne'er tempt me,
From my tiny brood of three,
Better things I do not need,
I have baby mouths to feed.

DUETT. (with overlapped voices)
[Sparrow.]
Oh, no, no, I think it best,
In my snug and cosy nest,
With my little mate to share,
For we are a happy pair.
[Maid.]
No, no, no, think it not best,
In your snug and cosy nest,
Not with mine can it compare,
And your little mate may share.

3.
[Maid.]
Oh what pretty words you say,
Spread your wings and fly away,
No more will I flirt or plan,
With a feathered gentleman.
[Sparrow.]
Thank you, thank you pretty maid,
Don't forget what you have said,
Gold and words lead men to fault,
Little birds require salt!

DUETT. (with overlapped voices)
[Sparrow.]
Thank you, thank you pretty maid,
Don't forget what you have said,
Gold and words lead men to fault,
Little birds require salt.
[Maid.]
Yes, oh yes your little maid,
Understands what you have said,
Much with which we all find fault,
Might be saved with little salt.

4.
[Maid.]
Goodbye, goodbye saucy bird,
I will profit by your word,
But with all your cunning art,
You may someday lose your heart.
[Sparrow.]
Ah, Ah, Ah pray say not so,
It was lost long, long ago,
This is why, I tell you true,
I have none for such as you.

DUETT. (with overlapped voices)
[Sparrow.]
Ah, ah, ah pray say not so,
It was lost long, long ago,
This is why I tell you true,
I have none for such as you.
[Maid.]
Ah, ah, ah can it be so?
Lost so early long ago;
If what you tell me is true,
I have done with such as you.
