(using the psuedonymn of Alice Hawthorne)

1.
Drifting from home o're the lone sea
Dreaming of dear ones and sighing for thee.
Far from my friends Sadly I roam
Thinking and dreaming -- dreaming of Home.
Tho' swift be my journer across the blue deep
And fair be the skies O're the path that I keep
A sigh to my heart with its burden will come
Knowing alas! I am drifting from home.

REFRAIN
Drifting from home o're the wide sea
Day after day drifting further from thee.

2.
Drifting from home Oh! how the heart
Saddens to think that from friends it must part
Parting perhaps just with a Sigh
Yet parting for ever when bidding good bye
Or coming again when the journey is o'er
But meeting its kindred and household no more
Ah! well may we sigh when ever we roam
Tho' fair be our prospect when drifting from home.

(REFRAIN)
