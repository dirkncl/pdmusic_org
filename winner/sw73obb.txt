1.
King George, he said, "now bother my head,
  Those people beyond the sea,
Must pay me more tax -- Egad they're too lax,
  Those people who love their tea."

CHORUS
But here's to the laddies, who took for their "Caddies,"
King Georges great ships of "tay",
And forget it not -- that their big teapot,
Was the whole of Boston Bay!

2.
The people said no! the thing wont go,
  We're taking no ships of tea,
'Till these hard taxes, the King relaxes,
  Not an ounce we'll buy, say we.

(CHORUS)

3.
The ships they came, in the King's great name,
  To the harbor of Boston town,
Each with scion, of the British Lion,
  And they dropped their anchors down.

(CHORUS)

4.
The Yankees said, "now, we will allow,
  We'll have a Tea Party this day,
That will put to shame, all of the name,
  And have it in Boston Bay."

(CHORUS)

5.
And the men went down, all from the town,
  And boarded the ships that lay,
At anchor so fast, and the tea that that cast,
  Out, into old Boston Bay.

(CHORUS)

6.
And this deed so bold, 'twas first foretold
  The dawn of our Liberty;
The glad day when, in our City of Penn,
  The colonies should be free.

(CHORUS)

7.
Then ladies to night, with hearts so light,
  While sipping your sweet Bohea,
The men remember, of that December,
  Of Seventeen Seventy Three!

CHORUS (last time)
A health to the laddies, who took for their "Caddies,"
King Georges great ships of "tay",
And forget it not -- that their big teapot,
Was the whole of Boston Bay!
