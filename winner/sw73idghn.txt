1.
I owned a little black and tan
  But had bad luck somehow,
He was a famous animal
  But I "don't got him" now

REFRAIN
For the ketchers cam round of a fine summer's day,
of a fine summer's day;
Oh! the ketchers came round when the pup was at play,
And the stole him, they stole him away.

2.
I trim'd his ears into a point,
  As short as would allow;
Oh! I spent money on this pup,
  But I don't got him now.

(REFRAIN)

3.
We called him "Nig" so black was he,
  Yet could not vote somehow,
But that don't make no difference,
  For I don't got him now.


4.
He was indeed a bully dog
  And went for rats I vow;
And he was down on pigs and cats,
  But I don't got him now.

(REFRAIN)

5.
One day he drove a Billy goat
  Up to a big hay mow,
But Nig all but, got butt to death,
  But I don't got him now.

(REFRAIN)

6.
He followed me from morn till night
  When e'er I would allow,
He'd rather run than stand a fight,--
  But I don't got him now.

(REFRAIN)

7.
His gentle bark I hear no more,--
  His musical bow-wow,
He's off with dogs that's gone before
  And I don't got him now.

(REFRAIN)
