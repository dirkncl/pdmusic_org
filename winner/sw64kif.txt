1.
Young Joe he was as nice a man
As any in the land
he never told his love to me
Tho' often press'd my hand
His failings were but few indeed
In fact, I knew of none,
Yet once he had the impudence
To kiss me just in fun.

2.
I chid him in most tender words
Indeed 'twas all in vain,
For as he begg'd my pardon then,
He kiss'd me o'er again.
I tore myself from his embrace
And strove his grasp to shun
But with a kind apology
He said 'twas all in fun.

3.
As time roll'd on and days went be
His lips, met mine again,
I half forget to chide him then,
I knew 'twould be in vain;
Now ladies fair and maidens shy,
Take my advice as one,
Let lovers kiss not on the sly
Unless you're fond of fun.
