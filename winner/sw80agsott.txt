1.
Here's a good send-off to thee,
And a health before you sail;
God speed thy ship across the sea,
Nor stormy winds prevail,
But should the tempest strike thy course,
And smite thy track across the main,
God speep thee to some friendly port,
And bring the safely home again.

REFRAIN
Then a good send-off once more,
A good send-off to thee,
God speed thee to that foreign shore,
And bring thee back again.

2.
Here's to all hale lads aboard,
And an extra tip for thee;
Fill up your glasses high, once more,
Before you leave the quay,
Then let thy craft with, all her speed,
Dash boldly thro' the water's wide,
Regardless of the coming hour,
In storm or calm whate'er betide.

REFRAIN
Then a good send-off once more,
From all who home remain,
God speed thee to that foreign shore,
And bring thee back again.
