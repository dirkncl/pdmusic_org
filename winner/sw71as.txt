To Maggie F. Winner.
"After Sundown" (1871)
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
from "Home Joys for the Piano Forte
or Parlor Organ Second Set" (#19)

1.
After sundown with its twilight
  Dying in the distant west,
After nightfall with its darkness,
  Comes the quiet hour of rest:
When the weary footstep homeward;
  After daily toil is o'er,
Turns with anxious pace to welcome
  Those who wait us at the door.

CHORUS
After Sundown with its darkness
As the shades of evening come,
How Sweet with friends to gather round
The cheerful hearth of home.

2.
After Sundown there are moments
  Sweet as day can e'er afford,
'Round the hearth with friends united,
  Kindly met in sweet accord;
After Sundown oh how pleasant,
  When the nights are cool and long,
With the near ones and the dear ones
  Met in social chat and song.

(CHORUS)
