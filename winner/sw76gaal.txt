"Gay As A Lark" (1876)
Canzonetta
Words and Music by
Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
Gay as a Lark in the sunshine of spring,
Floating and singing upon the wing;
Sporting in pleasure beneath a fair sky,
Happy forever, -- just so am I,
So --, so --, so am I,
So --, so --, so am I.
Bright is the sunshine lighting my way;
Fair is the moonlight as cheerful as day.

REFRAIN
Joyful and happy, oh then let me live
Sharing the pleasures that life can give,
Free as a birdling let loose from the ark,
Cheerful and merry "Gay as a Lark."

2.
Idly I squander the moments away,
Dreaming and scheming the live long day,
Never, oh never, to murmur and sigh,
Pining and whining! oh no, not I,
No --, no --, no not I,
No --, no --, no not I.
Let me be merry, let me be gay,
Life is too precious to fritter away.

(REFRAIN)
