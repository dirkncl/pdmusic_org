1.
O I'm a happy creature,
Merry from morn till night;
I love a gay and joyful way,
For life is my delight;
The world is all before me,
Never a care I know,
Then why should I despond or sigh,
When pleasures freely flow;

REFRAIN
For the days roll on in the same old way;
O give me then a heart that is gay.
The world is all before me,
Never a care I know,
Then why should I despond or sigh,
When pleasures freely flow.

CHORUS
For the days roll on in the same old way;
O give me then a heart that is gay.
The world is all before me,
Never a care I know,
Then why should I despond or sigh,
When pleasures freely flow.

2.
Tho' cloudy be the morning,
Sunny may be the noon;
But music ne'er can charm the ear,
If strings are out of tune.
Then sing in cheerful measure,
Merrily all the day;
And with a smile, forget awhile
Your sorrows while you may;

REFRAIN
For the days roll on in the same old way;
O give me then a heart that is gay.
Oh sing in cheerful measure,
Merrily all the day;
And with a smile, forget awhile
Your sorrows while you may.

(CHORUS)

3.
I wish there was no fighting
Never a speck of war,
That weak and strong could get along
With out a wound or scar;
I wish there was no sorrow
Never a cause of woe.
If only we could all agree
How jolly times would go.

REFRAIN
For the days roll on the same old way;
O give me then a heart that is gay.
I wish there was no sorrow
Never a cause of woe,
If only we could all agree
How jolly times would go.

(CHORUS)
