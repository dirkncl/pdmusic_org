1.
Our Nation calls for peace again,
From many lips the cry goes forth;
Let not the wish be now in vain
Ye people of the South and North;
Why should our hearts be made to bleed,
By sorrows such as war must cost;
Oh give us peace, what most we need,
Before the land we love is lost.

CHORUS
Oh give us peace, Oh give us peace,
Our UNION yet may be restored,
Though gentle words the strife may cease
'Twere better far than by the sword.

2.
Ye valleys of the sunny South
  How sad to see thy many graves
And Oh ye silent rivers now
  How many lie beneath the waves
How many mothers weep to day
  Who might their sorrows have been spared
And Oh how many yet may sigh
  'Ere peace again may be declar'd.

(CHORUS)

3.
If peace again should bless the land
  And reason rule the minds of men
The heart once more may know content
  And friends rejoice -- but not till then
Into each others laps we'll pour
  The best of all our faithful land
And with a friendship as of old
  Extend a kind and helping hand.

CHORUS
Oh give us peace, Oh give us peace,
Our UNION yet may be restored,
If gentle words cannot prevail,
It _must_ be conquered by the sword.
