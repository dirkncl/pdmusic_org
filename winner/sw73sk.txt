1.
Now I want to go and tell you how to make good sour-krout
So if listen mit your ears I'll tell you around aboud id,
Its not made of leather as some folks supposes,
But its made from dem flow'rs, what is called cabbage roses.

CHORUS
Sour-Krout is bully,
I tell you it is fine
So help me lieber gracious
I can eat him all de time
Sour-Krout is bully
Sour-Krout is fine
I can tell you lieber gracious
I can eat him all de time.

2.
Ven de cabbage is a growin just so nice as nice can be
We pull dem out and chop dem up not bigger as a pea,
We put dem in a tub and stomp dem mit our feet,
Und we stomp, stomp, and stomp, for to make dem nice und schweet.

(CHORUS)

3.
So den we put in plenty salk but don't use no snuff,
We don't use no skyum pepper nor any of dat stuff;
We put dem down the cellar till he begins to smell,
So help me lieber gracious, us Dutchmans like him well.

(CHORUS)

4.
So when he schmells like dunder, und can't schmell no schemeller,
We go down by dat tub what we leave down dat cellar;
We put some in a kettle mi speck und let dem bille,
So help me you can shmell em for fifty thousand miles.

(CHORUS)
