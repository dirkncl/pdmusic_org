"The Gates Are Ever Open,
companion to The Gates Ajar" (1874)
Adabpted to an original melody
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
How sad was the hearts of the household,
When the angels came down from the sky,
And led to their beautiful city,
Our child to those mansions on high;
We wept in our grief and our sorrow,
Yet knew we were sighing in vain,
How sweet, then, the promises of heaven,
To meet and behold her again;
How sweet, then, the promises of heaven,
To meet and behold her again.

CHORUS
Far the gates are wide open, wide open,
To those who are strangers to sin,
The gates are, yes, ever are open,
That we, too, may enter therein.

2.
We'll cross o'er the calm flowing river,
And meet again on the shore,
Where sorrow shall trouble us never,
And peace shall abide evermore.
Our darling shall take us and lead us,
With fond and affectionate hand,
Beside the still waters that wander
Afar o'er that beautiful land;
Beside the still waters that wander
Afar o'er that beautiful land.

(CHORUS)

3.
How sweet is the thought of the future,
To join with the lov'd ones again,
Tho' sad, our journey is over,
To part with the few who remain.
Then why should we e'er wish to tarry
When glory awaits us above,
With rest for the heart that is weary,
At home with the lost that we love;
With rest for the heart that is weary,
At home with the lost that we love.

(CHORUS)
