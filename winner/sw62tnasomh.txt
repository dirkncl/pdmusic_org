1.
There’s not a sorrow on my heart,
My soul is full of joy today.
For spring the gaudy spring has come
And all the earth is bright and gay,
And all the earth is bright and gay
And all the earth is bright and gay
The gaudy spring has come
And all the earth is gay.
I too have wander’d far and wide
To gather blossoms sweet and fair.
I’ve pluck’d the woodbine and the shrub
And twin’d the roses with my hair.

2.
The flow’r upon my brow may fade,
Its tint and perfume may depart.
But oh! its beauty like a dream
Shall linger still upon my heart,
Shall linger still upon my heart,
Shall linger still upon my heart,
Its beauty like a dream
Shall linger on my heart
For mem’ry ever must retain
The scenes we cherish in our day
And oh! how sweet to think again
Of happy moments past away.
