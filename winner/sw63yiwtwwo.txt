Respectfully Dedicated to Mrs. C. Henri.
"Yes! I Would the War Were Over" (1863)
Words and Music by Septimus Winner.
(aka Alice Hawthorne)

1.
Yes, I would the war were over,
  Would the cruel work were done;
With my country undivided,
  And the battle fought and won.
Let the contest now before us,
  Be decided by the sword,
For the war cannot be ended
  Till the Union is restor'd.

CHORUS
Yes, I would the war were over,
  Would the cruel work were done;
With my country still united
  And the many states in one.

2.
Dead upon the field of battle,
  Husbands, sons and brothers lie;
Friends are waiting -- wives and mothers,
  Looking for them -- bye and bye.
Far away from home forever,
  Many a noble boy lies slain;
Look not for thy child fond mother,
  Thou shalt see him not again.

(CHORUS)

3.
Yes I would the ware were ended,
  And the cruel struggle o'er.
But our flag must be defended,
  And our country as before.
Peace indeed, is Heaven blessing,
  Though its joys are easy lost,
Still we'll battle for our nation,
  Whatsoe'er it yet may cost.
