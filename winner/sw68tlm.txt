"The Lazaroni Maid" (1868)
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
Roaming thro' the city,
  Treating thee to song;
Chaunting forth a ditty
  The whole day long.
Look on my with pity,
  Listen to my lay;
And offer but a penny to a child I pray.
  Give me but a penny,
Give me but a mite,
  Friends are few, if any,
I may find to night.
  Ah among so manny,
Is there none to aid,
  Or offer but a penny for a roving maid.

[REFRAIN; solo]
Hark, hark, hark,
  Harken now to me,
A roving Lazaroni I am singing now for thee;
  List, list, list,
To a child give aid,
  And offer put a penny to a Lazaroni maid.

[CHORUS = quartet of REFRAIN]

2.
Every where I wander
  Thro' the crowded way.
Few I find to ponder
  Or to bid me stay;
Many prone to squander
  Pass me coldly by,
And seem to shum me ever with a heedless eye.
  Pity me oh brother,
As a homeless one;
  Father, Sister, mother,
Either, have I none,
  As there is no other,
Give me then thy aid;
  And offer but a penny to a roving maid.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
