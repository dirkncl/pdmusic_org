1.
Spring once said to the Nightengale,
  I mean to give you birds a ball,
Pray ma'am ask the birdies all,
  The birds and birdies great and small.

CHORUS
Tra la la la la,
Tra la la la la,
Tra la la la la,
Tra la la la la.

Tra la la la la,
Tra la la la la,
Tra la la la la la,
Tra la la.

2.
Soon they came from bush and tree,
  Singing sweet their songs of glee,
Each one fresh from its cosy nest,
  Each one dress'd in its sunday best.

(CHORUS)

3.
The Wren and Cuckoo danced for life,
  The Raven waltz'd with the Yellow bird's wife,
The awkward Owl and the bashful Jay,
  Wish'd each other a very good day.

(CHORUS)

4.
A Woodpecker came from his hole in the tree,
  And brought his bill to the company,
For the cherries ripe and berries red;
  'Twas a very long bill so the birdies said.

(CHORUS)

5.
They danced all day till the sun was low;
  'Till the mother birds prepared to go,
When one and all, both great and small,
  Flew home to their nests from the birdies' ball.
