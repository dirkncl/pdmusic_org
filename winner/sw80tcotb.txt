1.
SOLO.
Now sweet the chime of Sabbath bells,
Each one its creed in music tells;
In tones that float upon the air,
As soft as song, as pure as prayer,

DUETT.
And I will put in simple rhyme
The language of the golden chime

QUARTETTE.
My happy heart with rapture swells
Responsive to the bells sweet bells
Responsive to the bells sweet bells
Responsive to the bells sweet bells
My happy heart with rapture swells
Responsive to the bells sweet bells.

2.
SOLO.
"Ye purifying waters swell,"
In mellow tones rang out a bell;
Tho' faith alone in Christ can save,
Man must be plung'd beneath the wave,

DUETT.
To show the world unfalt'ring faith
In what the sacred scriptures saith

QUARTETT.
Oh swell ye rising waters swell
Peal'd out the clear ton'd Babtist bell
Peal'd out the clear ton'd Babtist bell
Peal'd out the clear ton'd Babtist bell
Oh swell ye rising waters swell
Peal'd out the clear ton'd Babtist bell.

3.
SOLO.
In deeds of love excel! excel!
Chim'd out from the ivied tow'rs, a bell;
This is a church not built on sands,
Emblem of one not built with hands;

DUETT.
Its forms and sacred rites revere
Come worship here come worship here

QUARTETTE.
In rituals and faith excel
Chime'd out th'E-pis-co-pa-lian bell
Chime'd out th'E-pis-co-pa-lian bell
Chime'd out th'E-pis-co-pa-lian bell
In rituals and faith excel
Chime'd out th'E-pis-co-pa-lian bell.

4.
SOLO.
"To all, the truth we tell! we tell!"
Shouted in ecstasies a bell;
Come all ye weary wand'rers see!
Out Lord had mad salvation free.

DUETT.
Repent, believe, have faith, and then
Be saved, and praise the Lord, Amen!

QUARTETTE.
Salvation's free, we tell, we tell,
Rang out the Methodistic bell,
Rang out the Methodistic bell,
Rang out the Methodistic bell,
Salvation's free, we tell, we tell,
Rang out the Methodistic bell.

5.
SOLO.
Farewell, farewell, base world, farewell
In touching tones exclaimed a bell;
Life is a boom, to mortals given
To fit the soul for bliss in heaven

DUETT.
Do no invoke th' avenging rod
Come here and learn the way to God;

QUARTETTE.
Say to the world, farewell, farewell
Pealed forth the Presbyterian bell,
Pealed forth the Presbyterian bell,
Pealed forth the Presbyterian bell.
Say to the world, farewell, farewell
Pealed forth the Presbyterian bell.
