1.
’Tis o’er the mountains far away
I’ve left my heart I fear,
Where-e’er I go I think of thee
My Pretty Sallie dear;
For when the nights dark shadows come,
And all the live long day,
I think of thee and sigh that I,
Am now so far away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, Sallie
Why ever, ever, ever shy,
Oh meet me, meet me with a welcome love,
For I’m coming bye and bye.

2.
Afar from, thee my Sallie dear,
Away from all I prize;
I miss thy voice, thy words of cheer,
The smile of thy bright eyes.
For near thee would I rather stay,
Tho’ with the free and brave;
But oh! my country call’d me love,
Thy home, and mine to save.

3.
But when the war is over love,
And peace anew shall reign
I hope to meet thee as of old,
And share thy smiles again;
For bright shall be our wedding day,
And joy shall fill the heart
When I am thine and thou art mine,
No more on earth to part.
