1.
Let the light of days depart,
And scenes like shadows fleet away,
Thou shalt dwell within this heart
Tho' scenes with all their charms decay;
Then smile that life may brook the spell,
That my spirit longs to start,
O smile that I may only tell,
How fond and how beloved thou art.

2.
Let the light of days depart,
And all that tends to prove thy fate,
Thou shall know how dear thou art,
Tho' time may teach thee all too late;
Then when the charm of thy bright smile,
Awakes the fondest thoughts that flow,
O let thy soul but pause awhile,
The love of one found heart to know.
