Respectfully Dedicated to John S. Fisher 
"New Friends, True Friends" (1860)
Ballad No. 42
Words and Music by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
(aka Alice Hawthorne)

1.
Changing, changing, day after day;
New friends, dear friends, passing away.
Scenes that were dear to the heart and eye
Passing away as the time goes by.
New friends, true friends, gentle and kind;
New friends, true friends, still do we find.

2.
Changing, changing, day after day;
Near ones, dear ones, passing away:
Still, as the days with their changes depart,
Time has its scenes that are dear to the heart.
New friends, true friends, gentle and kind;
New friends, true friends, still do we find.
