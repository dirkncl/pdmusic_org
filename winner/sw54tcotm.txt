1.
As from the earth the light of day
departed in the west away,
I left with eager step my home
To meet the heart that bid my come;
One that believed me, never deceived me
With a smile of cold deceit;
One that could prize me, never despise me,
But with joy, my coming greet.
The chimes kept pealing forth a strain,
That echoed o'er and o'er again
Just as the dreams of her I bore
That charm'd my spirit o'er and o'er.

2.
The bells kept pealing forth a strain
That floated o'er the dusky plain,
And as I fled with anxious speed,
Their music made me glad indeed:
For with the ringing, and with the singing
Of the voice that bid me come
Joy seem'd to meet me, pleasure to greet me,
'Neath the roof she call'd her home.
For oh! her voice was like a spell
That melted o'er my heart so well
That to its music and the chimes
I yet could list a thousand times.
