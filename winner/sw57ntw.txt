1.
How strange are the ways of the world --- only think!
Of the mortals that people its shores.
The women that eat, and the men who drink
And the backs to be cloth'd by the stores.
With plenty to eat, to drink and to spend,
Its mortals might never despair
Were it not for the sigh that is heard to ascend
When we find we have nothing to wear, to wear,
When we find we have nothing to wear.

2.
Miss Clara was truly as charming a maid
As ever my heart could desire.
I sought for her hand on a short promenade
For I knew of her gaudy attire.
I knew of her ribbons and dresses the best
Her moments too many to spare.
But she would not comply to my simple request,
For she had nothing to wear, to wear ---
For she had nothing to wear!

3.
And such is the case with Matilda and Jane,
With Mary and Nancy and all,
Tho' plenty of satins and laces, delaine ---
Not a dress for the concert or ball.
Oh would I could find 'neath the hoops of a skirt
A woman that would not declare
With a shrug of the shoulders in answer expect
That she really has "nothing to wear."
That she really has "nothing to wear."
