1. They say that all on earth must change,
As in the days of yore;
That friends beloved grow cold and strange,
And fond hearts meet no more.
If thus it is, one more fond kiss
Before that hour may be,
For dear to day as ever, is
Thy kind embrace to me.
Thy kind embrace, thy kind embrace to me.

2. The scenes of many days may fade,
Their forms may pass away,
But should the vows of friendship made
By thee sink to decay;
I ask, when lonely hours present
The past once dear to thee,
Thou wouldst but give thy spirit vent,
To rest one thought on me.
To rest one thought on me, one thought on me.

3. While ling’ring through this weary life,
If thou shouldst feel undone,
Remember in the worldly strife,
To love thee there is one,
And if afar from friends to rove,
Should  be thy sad decree,
Think on the one whom thou didst love,
And then remember me.
And then remember, then remember me.
