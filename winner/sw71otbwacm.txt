1.
I've travel'd much be sea and land,
To England, France and Germanie;
I've seen the sights we have at hand,
And those away across the sea;
I've done the Mountains and the Falls,
The Springs and Newport by the way;
I've had my sport, but none so great
As on the Board-walk at Cape May.

CHORUS
I've been around from year to year,
Across the sea and far away;
But never had so good a time
As on the Board-walk at Cape May.

2.
I've wander'd oft just after tea,
To take a stroll the beach along;
And what I've seen and what I've heard
I'll tell you in a little song.
Of what I know just let me hint,
The fun and flirting on the sly;
You needn't wonder how it is
So many people wink an eye.

(CHORUS)

3.
The other night, I do declare,
Walk'd Mrs. Brown with Billie Lee;
I came behind them unaware,
And -- Oh my eyes, what did I see!
He put his arm about her waist,
She held his hand in perfect bliss,
And just about the darkest place
I saw them hug and heard them kiss.

(CHORUS)

4.
I left the couple all alone
And turn'd my back upon the sight,
When right before my face I met
A married man with Lilly White!
She said 'twas sad to be alone
And wink'd at him behind her fan:
"It matters not, a bit," he said;
"My wife is with some other man."

(CHORUS)

5.
The moonlight nights are very fine,
You mustn't mind the falling dew,
But "you know how it is yourself."
Perhaps, like, you've "been there" too;
You know as much as I can tell;
We meet by chance, the usual way,
And that's the very reason why
We take the Board-walk at Cape May.

(CHORUS)
