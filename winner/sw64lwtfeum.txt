1.
Look with thy fond eyes upon me,
Speak with thy sweet voice again;
Smile and say that I may greet thee.
Let me ask thee not in vain.
None have gaz'd so fondly on me;
None have songs so sweet as thine
Let thy heart with favor bless me,
Tho' I ne'er may call thee mine;
Tho' I ne'er may call thee mine,
Tho' I ne'er may call thee mine;
Let thy hand with favor bless me,
Tho' I never may call thee mine.

2.
Look with thy fond eyes upon me,
Speak in thy familiar tone,
Have I not from out of many
Chosen thee, and thee alone,
Oh with what deep devotion
Have I learn'd to look on thee
Teach thy heart with true emotion,
Thus to prize and cherish me;
Thus to prize and cherish me,
Thus to prize and cherish me;
Touch thy heart with true emotion,
Thus to prize and cherish me.

3.
Look with thy fond eyes upon me,
With thy welcome smile serene,
Ev'ry gaze of thine, believe me
Sinks into my heart unseen,
Ev'ry little gift I treasure,
Sweet to claim and gaze upon
Ev'ry moment fraught with pleasure,
Is with thee my chosen one,
Is with thee my chosen one,
Is with thee my chosen one;
Ev'ry moment fraught with pleasure,
Is with thee my chosen one.
