"Jenny, Darling Jenny" (1859)
Ballad
Words and Music by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
(aka "Alice Hawthorne")

1.
Tripping through the meadow,
Jennie came today,
Thro' the meadow came today;
Gliding like a shadow
O'er the sunny way,
A shadow o'er the sunny way.
Singing, sweetly singing
As she went along,
Singing as she went along;
Distant echoes flinging
Back her merry song,
Flinging back her merry song.

CHORUS
Jenny dear, Jenny dear,
Jenny darling Jenny, Oh ...!
Jenny dear, my gentle Jenny,
Darling darling Jenny.

2.
What to me is sweeter
Than its gentle tone,
Sweeter than its gentle tone,
As I chance to meet her,
Coming all alone,
Meet her coming all alone.
Maidens there are many,
Others may adore,
Many others may adore;
None to me like Jenny,
Search the whole world o'er,
Search the wide, wide world o'er.

(CHORUS)

3.
Jenny's eyes are beaming
Ever with a smile,
Beaming ever with a smile,
And my heart is dreaming
Of her all the while,
Dreaming of her all the while;
Daily do I wander,
Where her feet have been,
Wander where her feet have been,
Ever growing fonder
Of the welcome scene,
Fonder of the welcome scene.

(CHORUS)
