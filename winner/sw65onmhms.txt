1.
A Nation mourns her martyr'd Son,
From many hearts there comes a sigh,
For him whose days on earth are done
Whose fame and deeds can never die.
Oh weep for him whose patient heart,
Gave pardon to a fallen foe;
Who acted well a manly part,
Tow'rds those who plan'd the fatal blow.

CHORUS
Oh weep for him, weep for the loss,
A people now must all abide,
And let the shrouded Banner toss,
For him who was a nation's pride.

2.
His weary work on earth is done,
His toll and sad trials now are o'er,
Yet to the hearts of many a one
His deeds shall live for ever more!
Toll on ye melancholy bells,
Tho' sad your mournful tones may be;
The heart with sorrow sadly swells,
To hear thy mournful melody.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh why, my Contry must thou bleed,
For deeds that rebels madly plan?
The time shall come when they may need
Just such a heart, just such a man!
Roll on ye muffled drums, roll on,
While hearts still mourn this sad event
Our land shall never own a son
As better man or President.

(CHORUS)
