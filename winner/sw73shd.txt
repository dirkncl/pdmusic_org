To Mrs. Isaac Moffatt.
"Some Happier Day" (1873)
Words by Isaac Moffatt.
Music by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
(using the psuedonymn of Alice Hawthorne)

1.
Entreat me not to sing to night
The strain that charm'd when all was gay,
Nor bid me wake the voice of mirth,
In this dark hour of sorrow's day;
The home that Grief has made her own,
Is closed 'gainst ev'ry cheering ray;
Then leave me to my lot awhile,
I'll sing perchance some happier day.

2.
Should I essay to break the spell
That wraps my soul in shroud of clay,
The notes that once had shamed the lark,
Would sing and die, in mournful lay;
Go, seek the hearts where joy holds court,
And bid them chant the gladsome lay;
If time the broken font can weld,
I'll sing for thee some happier day!
