1.
When morning comes lie not in bed
And yawn and gap the time away;
But like a man with level head,
Get up and make a good full day;
And if the partner of your life
Tries well her duties to fulfill,
If things go wrong don't blame your wife;
But take the matter with good will.
Sometimes the fire will not burn,
At times the kettle fails to boil;--
Don't blame your wife but take your turn,
Fall in and help with her toil.

REFRAIN
Don't blame your wife if things go wrong;--
If you would have her kind and true
(For she is weak and your are strong)
With most too much for one to do.

2.
When noontide comes and dinner waits
Upon the table fresh and hot,
With pleasant smile in hand round the plates,
If aught goes wrong, oh blame her not.
Don't murmur if the steak is tough,
For she don't grow the meat you know,
And if inclined to act the rough,
Just take the butcher "into tow!"
Speak not the words that bring a tear,
For she is weak and you are strong;
Say "better luch next time my dear,"
You'll feel better all day long.

(REFRAIN)

3.
When ev'ning comes and work is through,
Go home to tea with happy heart,
And when there's nothing else to do, --
Why in her duties take a part;
Just nurse the little kids and say
How sweet the flavor of the meat,
'Twill always drive dull care away;--
And how much better both will feel,
Sometimes a button goes amiss,
A stitch is needed here and there,
Don't blame your wife but with a kiss,
Just thank her for her kindly care.

(REFRAIN)
