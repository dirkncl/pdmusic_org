1.
Down upon the Rappahannock,
Lies the no-ble volunteer;
Ask me not my child, my darling,
When thy father will be here;
For upon that fated river,
Many hearts may sigh in vain.
Dream of home and friends forever
But shall not return again.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Down upon the Rappahannock
Peace ful scenes may yet abound.
War and strife may be forgotten
But the lost shall not be found.

2.
Down upon the Rappahannock,
Neath her waters on her shore,
Lie the hearts so early taken
From their homes forevermore.
Ah what scenes of pain and sorrow,
Come to homes so sweet of yore;
Some may shed their tears tomorrow
When today’s sad work is o’er.
