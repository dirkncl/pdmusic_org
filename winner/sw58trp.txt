1.
You may talk about the fashions,
  Of bonnets neat and small;
Of crinoline and flounces,
  But the stripes exceed them all,
I'm fond of little bonnets,
  Of skirts quite full and wide,
But they want the striped petticoat,
  To show them off beside.

2.
There's a beauty in the gaiter,
  That defies the clumsy boot,
But the tidy little slipper,
  Looks best upon the foot;
And if you wish to show it,
  Or have it well display'd,
Then with striped petticoat,
  Just take a promenade.

3.
All women take the fashions
  Of Empress and Queen,
Victoria wears the petticoat,
  And crinoline -- Eugene;
Victoria as a model,
  As ev'ry woman knows,
And ev'ry girl should imitate
  Her virtures, well as clothes.
