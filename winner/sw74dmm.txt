1.
There's a beautiful Isle afar,
Afar o'er the spread of the sea,
There's a heart that is sad today,
And eyes that are watching for me,
Though the months have been few,
Since I bid her adieu,
Yet it seems like an age since we met;
And the look that she gave,
Ere I launched on the wave,
I can never, ah! never forget.

CHORUS
Oh, thou beautiful Isle afar,
Afar o'er the spread of the sea,
Yes, 'tis dear to my heart you are,
Sweet home of dear Mollie Magee.

2.
There's a green little Isle beyond,
Across the wide waters away,
And I'm dreaming a dream so fond,
Of home and of Mollie, today,
And I think with a sigh,
As the moments go by,
Of our land that is over the sea;
Oh! I wonder awhile,
With a hope and a smile,
If my Mollie is dreaming of me.

(CHORUS)

3.
I am coming across the main,
Am coming again o'er the sea;
For I long to be home again
Beside thee, dear Mollie Magee.
If we meet on the shore,
We will part nevermore,
For our days shall be happy and bright;
And we'll go hand in hand
In our beautiful land,
Where our hearts may be joyous and light.

(CHORUS)
