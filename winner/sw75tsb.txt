1.
Come, let me see;
I'll try you all,
Whatever age, both great and small,
How well you know your A, B, C.
Come let us form a "Spelling Bee;"
Some to the right will please to go,
Some to the left, all in a row;
Now let me see what you can do,
And spell for me, Bick-i-bi-bo-bu.

CHORUS 1
B, A, Ba, B, E, Be,
R, I, Bick-i-bi, R, O, Be, --
Bick-i-bi-bo, B, U, Bu, --
Bick-i-be-bo-bu.

2.
All very good;
The task is plain;
Quite a success, we'll try again;
Keep to the text, whate'er your about,
He who shall fail must be drown'd out!
Mind as you go, your P's and Q's,
No wasted chance, it's all no use;
Come, now, again we'll try anew;
Now spell for me, Dick-i-di-da-du.

CHORUS 2
D, A, Da, D, E, De,
D, I, Dick-i-di, D, O, De, --
Dick-i-di-do, D, U, Du, --
Dick-i-di-do-du. --

CHORUS 3
I, A, La, L, E, Le,
L, I, Lick-i-li, L, O, Lo, --
Lick-i-li-lo, I, U, Lu, --
Lick-i-li-lo-lu.

CHORUS 4
P, A, Pa, P, E, Pe,
P, I, Pick-i-pi, P, I, Po, --
Pick-i-pi-po, P, U, Pu, --
Pick-i-pi-po-pu.
