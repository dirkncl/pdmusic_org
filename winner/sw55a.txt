"Let Us Live With a Hope" (1855)
Respectfully Dedicated to J. P. Ordway Esq.
by Septimus Winner
[aka Alice Hawthorne]

1.
Let us live with a hope for a better day--Mary,
A better day yet may be known,
And if toil hath reward for the wilting hand ever,
Thou'll welcome the fruits of mine own;
I will toil with a pride,
'Till I share by thy side,
The comforts and pleasures of home;
O then live with a care,
And forget thy despair,
In visions of moments to come:

CHORUS
Let us live with a hope for the better time coming
'Tho dark be our dreams for a while
For there's joy in the thought of a better day dawning
Then welcome thy fate with a smile.

2.
I know that the fears of a darker day--Mary,
In silence thy heart will endure,
And I sigh with a gaze on thy patient face often,
In pity for all who are poor,
With the nerve of a man,
I will strive while I can,
To better thy portion in life;
O then lend me a hand,
And thy heart shall command,
The blessings of mother and a wife.

(CHORUS)
