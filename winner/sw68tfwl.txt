1. Our feet may wander far, far away
’Mid scenes of beauty from place to place,
But time can never for one short day
The reccollection of home efface.
The heart may wander and, for awhile
Forget its pleasure as on we rove;
But o’er the features then comes no smile
When we remember the friends we love.

CHORUS [with overlapping voices, sung after each VERSE]
The friends we love, the friends we love
When we remember the friends we love,
But o’er the features there comes no smile
When we remember the friends we love.

2. The cheerful swallow returns in spring
When sunny meadows no more are cold,
And on a happy and graceful wing
Revisits newly her nest of old.
And thus for ever the heart will seek
With sad emotion its home afar,
There is a story we long to speak.
It matters little where e’er we are.
