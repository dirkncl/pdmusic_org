1.
We met as many have before
Nor wish'd nor hoped to meet again;
Ne'er dreaming of our fate in store
With days of pleasure or of pain.
We met again with right good will
Yet paus'd when parting at the door;
We linger'd with a sigh, but still
As only friends and nothing more,
We linger'd with a sigh, but still
As only friends and nothing more.

CHORUS
We met as many oft have met,
And just as others have before;
We meet from time to time, and yet,
As only friends and nothing more.

2.
We sat upon the trellised porch
Full many an eve and pleasant day,
In cloud and sunshine off and oft,
To wile the happy hours away.
The fleeting moments came and went
Till months were numbered by the score
And still our passing days were spent
As only friends and nothing more,
And still our passing days were spent
As only friends and nothing more.

(CHORUS)
