[CHORUS (A) sung before each verse]
Away, away, the morn is brightly breaking,
Away, away! All care and toil forsaking,
Away, away,
away, away, away,
For the merry morning is telling of a
bright and joyous day.

1.
For the sunny fields are fair,
With their beauty ev'rywhere,
And how bracing in the air,
And how bracing in the air,
Let us wander far away,
On this happy holiday,
Let us wander far away.

[CHORUS (B) sung after each verse]
Away, away,
away, away, away,
For the merry morning is telling of a
bright and joyous day.

2.
Let us seek the river's side,
And we'll launch upon the tide
Of her waters clear and wide,
Of her waters clear and wide,
Let us merry be, and gay,
On this happy holiday,
As the moments pass away, away.

3.
Ere the morning's late advance,
Let us join the merry dance
And exchange the cheerful glance,
And exchange the cheerful glance,
To the shady woods away,
On this happy holiday,
To the shady woods away, away.
