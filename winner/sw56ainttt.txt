1.
Am I not true to thee? true as a star,
That gleams in the firmament night after night;
Am I not true to thee, ever the same,
Whate'er be thy portion to woe or delight.
Tho' fate may intrude like a cloud to the star,
Still am I true to thee, home or afar;
Still am I true to thee, home or afar.

2.
Am I not true to thee, true as the voice,
That echoes the charm of the wanderer's song;
Am I not true to thee, why wilt thou ask?
When thus I have lov'd thee and sought thee so long
Tho' faint be the vow, as the hill's gentle voice
Still am I true to thee, smile and rejoice,
Still am I true to thee, smile and rejoice.

3.
Am I not true to thee, doubt me no more,
For echoes are whispers and stars are but faint;
Am I not dear to thee; chide not again
How canst thou upbraid me with sorrow's complaint
Thy heart must deceive thee, thy trust I implore
Still I am true to thee, doubt me no more,
Still I am true to thee, doubt me no more.
