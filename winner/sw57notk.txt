1.
My sister and I were as fond of the beaus
As any one under the sun;
But she had her lover as ev'ry one knows,
Yet really I never had one.
I look'd with a covetous bosom on Kate
For I envied her fortune and bliss.
And I said to myself Oh how drear is my fate,

[REFRAIN]
With no one to love or to kiss -- to kiss,
With no one to love or to kiss.

2.
His visits were frequent by night and by day,
And gifts -- only think! what a store,
No shower nor tempest could keep him away,
Or silence his knock at the door.
He never would smile half as kindly on me,
For he call'd HER his beautiful Miss.
And I heard his say ah! how lone he would be,

(REFRAIN)

3.
I'm bound to be married if ever I find
A man to my motion arrayed,
For I never will live like my lovely old aunt,
And finally die on old maid;
If any one asks for my heart and my hand,
I will really consent to be his,
For I'm tired of living alone in the land,

(REFRAIN)
