"Raw Recruits; or, Abraham's Daughter" (1862)
by Septimus Winner
As sung with great applause by
Bryant's Minstrels of New York

1.
Oh! kind folks listen to my song
It is no idle story.
It's all about a volunteer,
Who's goin' to fight for glory;
Now don[']t you think that I am right,
For I am nothin' shorter,

CHORUS
And I belong to the Fire Zou-Zous,
And don[']t you think I oughter,
We're goin' down to Washington
To fight for Abraham's daughter.

2.
Oh! should you ask me who she am
Columbia is her name, sir.
She is the child of Abraham,
Or Uncle Sam, the same, sir.
Now if I fight, why ain[']t I right,
And don[']t you think I ought[-]er,

CHORUS
The volunteers are a pouring in,
From every loyal quarter,
And I'm going to Washington
To fight for Abraham's daughter.

3.
They say we have no officers,
  But ah! they are mistaken;
And soon you'll see the rebels run
  With all the fuss they're makin'
For there is one who just sprung up,
  He'll show the foe no quarter.

CHORUS
(McClellan is the man I mean)
  You know he had'nt oughter,
For he's gone down to Washington
  To fight for Abraham's daughter.

4.
We'll have a spree with Johnny Bull,
  Perhaps some day or other,
And won't he have his fingers full,
  If not a deal of bother;
For Yankee boys are just the lads
  Upon the land or water,

(CHORUS)
And won[']t we have a "bully" fight
  And don[']t you think we ought[-]er,
If he is caught at any time
  Insulting Abraham's daughter.

5.
But let us lay all jokes aside,
  It is a sorry question.
The man who would these States divide,
  Should hang for his suggestion.
One Country and one Flag, I say,
  Who e'er the war may slaughter;

CHORUS
So I'm goin' as a Fire Zou-a
  And don[']t you think I ought[-]er
I[']m going down to Washington
  To fight for Abraham's daughter.

corps in the French army --
