1.
There are friends that we never forget.
There are hearts that we ever hold dear.
Tho' we meet with a kiss in a moment of bliss,
Yet we part with a sigh and a tear.
Oh we learn our first lesson of love,
And the home where our childhood is pass'd,
And we never forget tho' we part with regret,
The friends of our youth till the last.

CHORUS
There are friends that we never forget;
There are hearts that we ever hold dear.
Tho' we meet with a kiss, in a moment of bliss,
Yet we part with a sigh and a tear.

2.
There are friends that we never forget.
Tho' the seas may divide us for years.
Yet we linger apart with a sorrowing heart,
In an absence that only endears.
There are friends that we never forget,
There are hearts that we ever hold dear,
Tho' we find but a few, who are earnest and true,
Yet how sweet is our passing career.

(CHORUS)
