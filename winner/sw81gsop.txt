1.
God save our President,
Stretch forth thy hand,
God bless our Government,
Bid it to stand.
Scatter our enemies
Broadcast and far,
Keep from our Commonwealth
Turmoil and war.

CHORUS
God save our President, (Stretch forth thy hand,)
Stretch forth thy hand, Almighty
God bless our Government, (Bid it to stand,)
Bid it to stand.

2.
God save our President,
Give him our aid,
Say in thy whisperings,
"Be not afraid."
Give him the strength wherewith
To battle for right,
In thy omnipotence
Give him the might.

(CHORUS)

3.
God save our President,
Long may he reign,
Rulling with principles
Thou shalt ordain.
God save our Government:
In thee we trust,
God keep our President
Upright and just.

(CHORUS)

[Our 20th President James Abram Garfield was in office from
1881 until he was shot on July 2 by Charles J. Guiteau, and
later died on 19 Sept. 1881.]
