1.
The soldiers are passing with music so loud;
Of their swords and their feathers they're mightily proud.
||: The girls in a hurry run out in the street;
The one gives a nod, and another looks sweet. :||


2.
Run after your lovers as far as you will,
I'll stay in my chamber so cosy and still.
||: What care I how much you all run, gape and stare,
My true love's at work in yon shop over there. :||

3.
By land and by water, north, south, east or west,
My own darling boy is the one I love best.
||: What care if I am busy from morning till night?
The thought of my true love's my only delight. :||

4.
And though now and then with another I stroll,
Yet his image sparkles ans shines in my soul;
||: And if to another I do sometime smile,
My boy, he is safe in my heart all the while. :||
