To A. R. Taylor Esq.
"Resurgam" (1871)
(I Will Rise Again)
For the Bass or Contralto Voice.
By Septimun Winner, 1827-1902

1.
The setting sun, thro' windtorn clouds,
  That closed a dark and stormy day,
Sent to the twilight gloom, that shrouds
  The distant east, its feeble ray,
Sent to the twilight gloom, that shrouds
  The distant east, its feeble ray.

One who had waited long indeed
  For sunshine, ere the gloom of night,
Seem'd in the purple mists to read
  "Resurgam", as it sank from sight.
  "Resurgam", as it sank from sight.
Seem'd in the purple mists to read
  "Resurgam" -- "Resurgam"!

2.
A wayward youth, in feeble health,
  Thro' sin and dispostion lost;
Bereft of friends, devoid of wealth,
  Review'd his life with tearful cost.
Bereft of friends, devoid of wealth,
  Review'd his life with tearful cost.

When frenzied brain and knitted brow,
  Yet with a proud resolve, swore he
An earnest vow, deep, muttered low
  "Resurgam" shall my motto be.
  "Resurgam" shall my motto be.
An earnest vow, deep, muttered low
  "Resurgam" -- "Resurgam"!

3.
Whate're be set in worthy ground
  Seem'd sown or wasted all in vain;
A fruitless harvest came around,
  For want of Heav'ns refreshing rain.
A fruitless harvest came around,
  For want of Heav'ns refreshing rain.

And when at last the Reaper came
  To separate the grain and chaff,
Was placed above my noble name,
  "Resurgam" as an epitaph!
  "Resurgam" as an epitaph!
Was placed above my noble name,
  "Resurgam" -- "Resurgam"!

[the complete POEM:
note that Verse 3
ends the song using stansa VI]

I.
The setting sun, thro' windtorn clouds,
  That closed a dark and stormy day,
Sent to the twilight gloom, that shrouds
  The distant east, its feeble ray,
One who had waited long indeed
  For sunshine, ere the gloom of night,
Seem'd in the purple mists to read
  "Resurgam" -- "Resurgam"!

II.
A wayward youth, in feeble health,
  Thro' sin and dispostion lost;
Bereft of friends, devoid of wealth,
  Review'd his life with tearful cost.
When frenzied brain and knitted brow,
  Yet with a proud resolve, swore he
An earnest vow, deep, muttered low
  "Resurgam" -- "Resurgam"!

III.
I've learned, said he, how frail is man;
  How dissolute in all his ways.
Now with reform I'll strive and plan
  For woman's love and win her praise,
But after many days he learned
  That none were faultless whom he met:
With spirit crushed, again he turned,
  "Resurgam" was his motto yet.

IV.
And though the world dealt harshly, still
  When nearly ev'ry hope had died,
He fought with strong, persistant will
  'Gainst all the ills that could betide.
He seemed to murmur at his fate,
  Or, like a coward, sigh and fret;
But cried with paiision deep and great
  "Resurgam" is my motto yet.

V.
But life brought crossed for the man,
  And troubles o'er his pathway crept,
Destroying every hopeful plan,
  Till nature, almost conquered, wept.
Yet like a hero, still he fought
  The world's reverses with a will:
Whate'er the lesson time had taught,
  "Resurgam" was his motto still.

VI.
Whate'er be set in worthy ground
  Seemed sown and wasted all in vain;
A fruitless harvest came around,
  For want of Heaven's refreshing rain.
And when at last the Reaper came
  To separate the grain from the chaff,
Was placed above a noble name,
  "Resurgam" as an epitaph!

VII.
The step of time, with steady pace,
  Without a halt goes marching on;
Yet man must find a resting-place
  When life is o're -- his mission done,
And oh, how blest our final day,
  When death comes as a last relief,
If, filled with faith, we then can say,
  "Resurgam" is my firm belief!

VIII.
We all must strike and work with might,
  Till our existence wears away;
Tho' earth may be a long, long night,
  Yet Heav'n is on eternal day.
We must endure a world like this,
  Awaiting comfort in the next,
If we but take -- not go amiss --
  "Resurgam" as our guiding text.
