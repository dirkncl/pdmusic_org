1. [=REFRAIN]
Oh where, and oh where, is my leetel wee dog?
Oh where! oh where can he be?
Mit his ears cut short and his tail cut long,
Oh where, oh where is he?

2.
Sausage is good, and Bologna also,
Oh where! oh where can he be?
Day makes dem of horse, and dey makes dem of dog,
And I fear dat dey makes dem of he.

REFRAIN
Oh where, and oh where, is my leetel wee dog?
Oh where! oh where can he be?
Mit his ears cut short and his tail cut long,
Oh where, oh where is he?

3.
Whenever I see a Bologna I shtop,
And I whistle dis beautiful air,
But the sausages never run out of the shop
So I don't think my leetel dog's there.

(REFRAIN)

4.
But either in Camden or Mannynak, or New York,
  Or else in my own Amsterdam,
My leetel dog's made into beef, or to pork,---
  Unless he is chicken und ham!

(REFRAIN)

5.
De reason I tink my leetel wee dog
  To sausages must have been mince;--
I had a Bologna for dinner last week,
  And by dam, I have growled ever since!

(REFRAIN)

6.
MORAL: (adorning a tail)
My leetel wee dog waggles his stump of a tail,
  Whenever he wishes for prog;
If the tail was the strongest, I makes no doubt,
  The tail would waggle the dog.

ENCORE VERSES.
7.
Well, perhaps I have tasted my little wee dog
  And swallowed his last vital spark;
His flesh it was sausage, his skin it is gloves,
  But what have they done mit his BARK?

(REFRAIN)

8.
My little dog's spirits, that neverwould flag,
  Are formed into "spirits of WHINE;"
His tail is preserved as the last of a WAG,
  And his BARK is "sulphate of CANINE."
