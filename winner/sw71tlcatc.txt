To Joseph Jefferson, Esq.
"That Little Church Around the Corner" (1871)

    Mr. JOSEPH JEFFERSON, who made the application to the
  clergyman to officiate, said that he regretted the publicity
  that had been given to the affair, both for the sake of
  religion and in view of the feelings of the bereaved family.
  It appears that the clergyman first consented to allow the
  funeral to take place from his church; but when he learned
  that Mr. Holland had been an actor, he withdrew his consent.
  He added, that there was a little church around the corner
  from his, where funerals of actors had taken place, and
  where he advised Mr. Jefferson to make application. Mr
  Jefferson left with the characteristic and almost poetical
  remark,
       "ALL HONOR TO THAT LITTLE CHURCH AROUND THE CORNER."

1.
All honor to that little church
That church around the corner,
That needs no gems or jewels rare,
Or presents to adorn her;
With charity she shows to all,
The saint as well as sinner
That christian spirit still exists
In that church around the corner.

CHORUS
In that little church around the corner
In that little church around the corner
That christian spirit still exists
In that little church around the corner.

2.
With christian love she dries the tears,
That fall from ev'ry mourner,
By giving faith and love to all,
In the church a round the corner.
Faith, Hope and charity are hers;
To her be ever honor;
The church built on our Saviour's word
That church around the corner.

(CHORUS)
