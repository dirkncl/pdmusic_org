To Miss Emma Douglas, Newark, N. J.
"Did You Think of Me Today" (1864)
Ballad
Words and Music by Septimus Winner

1.
Did you think of me today,
As the moments sped away?
Did you wish that I were near,
With a gentle voice to cheer?
Or, didst thou not at all
My absent form recall,
Nor sigh that I should be
So far away from thee.
Nor sigh that I should be
So far away from thee.

2.
Did you think of me today,
If your heart was light and gay?
Did you wish me by your side
For a moment to abide?
Or, if thou hast been sad
Could me smile have made thee glad,
Tell me truly, tell me pray,
Did you think of me today?
Tell me truly, tell me pray,
Did you think of me today?


3.
Dost thou know how dear thou art
To my sad and lonely heart?
That every joy I own
I would share with thee alone.
I have long'd to meet thy sight,
Since the morning's early light,
Tell me, tell me now I pray
Did you think of me today?
Tell me, tell me now I pray
Did you think of me today?
