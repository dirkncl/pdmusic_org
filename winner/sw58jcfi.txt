1.
Cuba, fair isle of the far sunny South,
Sweet land of romance and renown.
We wait with a welcome, and long for the day,
To claim thee as part of our own.
Our hearts are for thee,
Fair isle of the sea,
We sigh to extend thee our hand.
Oh shall we not claim,
And unite with our name
Thy fate and thy fortunes fair land.

2.
Cuba, fair isle, must we seek thee in vain,
Thou gem of our neighboring sea,
When _we_ as a nation, would gladly divide
Our wealth and our honors with thee.
Then scorn not the voice
That waits to rejoice,
When fate shall divide us no more.
Oh hasten the day,
When our flag shall display,
Its stars and stripes on thy shore.
