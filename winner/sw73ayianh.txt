1.
My father was good-looking,
  At least they tell me so:
My mother she was handsome,
  And that I ought to know.
The fam'ly I resemble,
  'Tis said, and I am sure! --
"And yet I am not happy"
  Because I'm rather poor.

REFRAIN
And yet I am not happy,
  O lay me on the shelf;
"And yet I am not happy"!
  How is it with yourself?

2.
I've lots of fine companions
  Both rich and poor they be,
But none I find to fancy
  A preference for me.
I've met, and lov'd, and parted --
  Been married and divorced,
"And yet I am not happy"
  Because in love I'm crossed!

(REFRAIN)

3.
The world is all before me,
  I've nothing much to do;
My life is rather easy,
  And I enjoy it too --
I'm fond of fun and frolic,
  And seem to have my share,
"And yet I am not happy"
  With nothing much to wear.

(REFRAIN)

4.
I'm very fond of pleasure,
  And easy with my talk;
I roam the Park and city,
  And daily take my walk.
As round the world I travel,
  Upon my shape I pride,
"And yet I am not happy"
  I can't afford to ride.

(REFRAIN)

5.
My home is snug and tidy,
  With comforts good and fine, --
A kitchen and a parlor
  Wherein to dance, or dine;
I've nothing to annoy me --
  To make me sigh or fret,
"And yet I am not happy"
  Because I ain't, you bet.

(REFRAIN)

6.
I read the books and papers,
  I play and dance and sing,
I meet and flirt with lovers,
  And all such sort the thing;
I care for none among them.
  Indeed! Oh no, not I!
"And yet I am not happy"
  Alas! I know not why.

(REFRAIN)
