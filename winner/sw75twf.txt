1.
A terful, family did dwell,
Who cried all day, I grieve to tell.
And people said, "they can't be well."
Poor things alack a day.
The father who cried for years,
One day exclaimed, "good bye my dears."
And then discovered himself in tears.
And cried himself away. Oh!

REFRAIN
Father, Uncle, Aunt and Mother,
Sixteen sisters and a Brother
And the baby makes another,
Weeping all the day.

2.
The oldest girl whose name was Kate,
A giddy think of sixty eight
Did make a pond, I here must state
Of salt tears in the lane.
She kiss'd the family all 'round
And then jump'd in and she was drowned.
The verdict that the jury found
Was water on the brain. Oh!

(REFRAIN)

3.
The other sisters cried all day,
So much, folks thought it rained, they say,
And with umbrellas went their way;
Alas, poor mourning hearts.
Their weeping made a fearful din.
But 'twas a crying shame and sin.
For Government to buy them in
For city water carts. Oh!

(REFRAIN)

4.
The uncle, aunt and children too,
Cried in the milk, which turned it blue,
And oh their tears were not a few.
Of fun, they never knew.
Their mother who was named Sophier,
Got married to the old court crier,
The baby's lungs will never tire
In crying boo-oo-oo. Oh!

(REFRAIN)
