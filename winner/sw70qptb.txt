1.
Queer people there be who live in the world,
And worry along with the wise;
Who never can see as other folks do,
Tho' nothing be ailing their eyes.
I know an old chap who does not deny,
The world is as round as you please
But vessels he says, sail over its edge
Because it is round like a cheese --
But vessels he says, sail over its edge,
Because it is round like a cheese.

CHORUS
Queer people we find where-ever we go,
With traits that are odd in their way
Some wriggle in walk, some giggle in talk,
And others have nothing to say.

2.
Queer people ther be, we very well know,
Who travel about with us all
Yet never grow old like the rest of the world,
Thro' winter, or summer, or fall.
I know an old maid of forty at least
The fact may be very well seen;
For more than a score, yes a number of years:
She has not been more than eighteen --
For more than a score, yes a number of years
She has not been more than eighteen.

(CHORUS)

3.
Queer people there be -- that husband of mine,
So cross and contrary is he,
I can't understand why 'tis that we fight,
For surely we never agree,
He's the queerest old customer ever you saw
If up and a bout or asleep
If I'm in the right he's sure to be wrong!
He vexes me so I could weep --
If I'm in the right he's sure to be wrong!
He vexes me so I could weep.

(CHORUS)

4.
Queer people there be, and who can deny,
The truthful assertion I make;
For every one knows a dozen or more,
I labor not under mistake.
Your mother-in-law -- I'm sure she is one,
Another's your uncle or aunt,
Your neighbor next door and may be yourself
That others may see if you can't --
Your neighbor next door and may be yourself
That others may see if you can't.

(CHORUS)
