1.
The roses all are dead,
And the lilacs are no more;
The cowslips, too, have fled,
Yet the summer is not o'er;

[REFRAIN]
Wherefore, wherefore, know not I!
Wherefore, wherefore, should I sugh?

2.
The daisies too, are gone,
All so early in the year;
Of tulips there are none,
Tho' the summer still is here;

[REFRAIN]
Wherefore, wherefore, why complain?
Wherefore, wherefore, all in vain?

3.
And thus life's own day,
  Ere the morn of youth is gone;
Our friends have passed away--
  We have lost them, one be one;

[REFRAIN]
Wherefore, wherefore, should I weep?
Wherefore, wherefore, sweet their sleep!
