"There Is No One Like a Mother" (1862)
Words and Music
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
When the heart is sad and lonely,
And the mind is fill'd with care,
Life is a burden only,
For the weary soul to bear;
Then should we try to smother
The spell, beyond our power,
There is no one like a mother,
In that dark and cheerless hour;
There is no one like a mother,
In that dark and cheerless hour.

2.
Should our faith in friends be shaken;
Let us wander where we will,
Tho we feel as if forsaken,
There is one to love us still.
Her love is like no other,
However our fate be cast,
For there's no like a mother,
Ever faithful to the last,
For there's no like a mother,
Ever faithful to the last.

3.
Oh the heart may have its pleasures,
And the soul may have its rest,
But of all our dearest treasures,
Is a mother's love the best.
Ah! never can another,
Her face in life supply,
For there's no one like a mother,
And we dread to see her die,
For there's no one like a mother,
And we dread to see her die.
