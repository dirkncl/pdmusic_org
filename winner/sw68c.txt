To Miss Dora C. Stiles, Stowe, VT
"Whispering Hope" (1868)
VOCAL DUETT
Words and Music by
Septimus Winner
[aka Alice Hawthorne]

1.
Soft as the voice of an angel.
Breathing a leson unheard.
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word.
Wait, till the darkness is over
Wait, till the tempest is done.
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone.

CHORUS
Whispering Hope
Oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.
Whispering Hope
Oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

2.
If in the dusk of the twilight
Dim be the region afar.
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us
Why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day.

(CHORUS)
