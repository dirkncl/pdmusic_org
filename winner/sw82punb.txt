1.
Kind stranger, show pity, the night is at hand,
And poor little sister no longer can stand;
We're fainting with hunger, oh, hark, to our cry!
Heed, heed us in mercy, nor leave us to die.
Alone in the world with no mother, no home,
Ah, two friendless children in sorrow we roam;
The dark clouds are gath'ring above in the sky,
For love of thy dear ones, oh, pass us not by!

CHORUS
Alone in the world with no mother, no home,
Ah, two friendless children in sorrow we roam;
The dark clouds are gath'ring above in the sky,
For love of thy dear ones, oh, pass us not by!

2.
Ah, once in a home that was happy and fair,
We knew the sweet bliss of a kind mother's care;
Unseen was a tear, and unheard was a sigh,
And peaceful the days and the month's glided by,
But father and mother are now in the grave,
And helpless the dangers of life must we brave;
Kind stranger, give something, for hard in our way,
And heaven will bless you, oh, help us, we pray!

(CHORUS)
