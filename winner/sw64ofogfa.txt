1. Our flag o’er Georgia floats again,
By native breezes tost;
Its starry folds must now remain
No matter what it cost.
  Tho’ blood may flow
  ’Mid scenes of woe,
It shall not be in vain:
  Let nations know, 
  Both friend and fie,
We can our rights retain.

CHORUS 1-3.
Our flag o’er Georgia waves again
By native breezes tost;
Its starry fold must now remain
No matter what it cost.

2. In all the land, from east to west,
From Florida to Maine,
Our banner yet shall kiss the breeze,
In triumph once again.
  We’ll show the world
  Its stripes unfurl’d
For Freedom and for Right;
  And all shall see,
  That Liberty
Mus triumph in her might.

3. Now let the world our strength behold,
For certain is our might.
We’ll struggle as our sires of old,
And battle long for right.
  No jealous foe
  Shall overthrow.
America thy fame;
  In all thy pride,
  Far, far and wide,
Man shall respect thy name.
