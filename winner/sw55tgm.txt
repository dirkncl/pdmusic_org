1.
Fair, fair moon, how mild thy light,
Streaming o'er the meadows in the quiet of the night;
Fair, fair moon, how sweet thy glow,
Shining on the river like a field of fallen snow.
Like a friend that comes in need,
Thou art to me now indeed,
In the dark and silent hour,
Lighting up the waters with thy sweet and magic pow'r.

2.
Fair, fair moon, how sweet thy hue,
Moving like a golden light amid the depths of blue.
Fair, fair moon, light up my way;
Shine upon the waters with thy mild and welcome ray.
Light my path tho' wild it be,
To the heart that waits for me,
For my soul impatient now,
Waiteth for the welcome of a fond and loving brow.
