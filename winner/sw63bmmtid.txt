  INCIDENT.---After the fight of Gettysburg, a young Union
Private of rare soul and abilities, mortally wounded, was
taken to the house of a Union family. This family comprised
three orphan sisters, of eighteen, thirty, and thirty-five.
At their hands he received every attention, and found the
comforts of a home. Three or four hours after being brought
to this place, and having his wounds dressed by a surgeon,
the ladies took their sewing, and sat near the bedside of
their suffering guest. A few hours before death, the poor
soldier, looking them in the face, with tenderest emotion,
uttered the substance of the following beautiful ballad.

1.
Ladies, some one be my mother;
  Then 'twill seem that I am home;
I'll imagine I'm a brother,
  Hearing each familiar home;
But I want a mother near me,
  With that heaven in her eye;
Ladies, some one be my mother,
  Be my mother till I die.

CHORUS
Now I feel my wound is mortal,
  Soon I'll breath my parting sigh,
Ladies, some one be my mother,
  Be my mother till I die.

2.
Long before I was a soldier,
  Long before I fought and bled,
In our cottage all the dear ones
  Thus would gather round my bed.
Do not treat me as a stranger;
  Let me feel a brother's tie;
One of you I want as mother,
  Be my mother till I die.

CHORUS
Soon no wicked war will harm me;
  Angels bringing peace are nigh;
Ladiers, some one be my mother,
  Be my mother till I die.
