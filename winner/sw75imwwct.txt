1.
If my wishes would come true
I would wish thee joy today,
Health and friends to cheer thee too;
On a bright and happy way,
I would wish that to thy life
All the moments might be sweet, --
Free from care and void of strife --
Blessings falling at thy feet.

CHORUS
If my wishes would come true,
If my hopes were not in vain;
I would fondly wish that you, too
Might the joys of life attain.

2.
If my wishes would come true
I would have thee near me now
I would speak thy praises too;
As I gazed upon thy brow,
I would have thee by my side
Cheering with thy gentle voice
Since thou art, alone, my pride
Making my sad heart rejoice.

(CHORUS)

3.
If my wishes would come true
What would be my heart's desire?
May I ask the same of you,
Need I venture to inquire
If my wishes would come true
I would wish thee mine alone,
Wishing still a wish anew,
Thou wouldst take me as thine own.

(CHORUS)
