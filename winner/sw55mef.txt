1.
When the tint is on the daisy,
And the birds are on the wing,
I remember in my childhood,
How I loved the sunny spring;
When the green grass clothes the meadow,
And the rosed bloom so fair;
I remember in my childhood
How I bound them with my hair
But the joys of youth are gone,
And the scenes on which I smiled,
Yet I love the merry springtime;
With its breath so sweet and mild,
Yet I love the merry springtime;
And again would be a child.

2.
When the trees begin to blossom,
And the blue is on the sky,
I remember in my childhood
How the moments fleeted by;
When the butter-cups are blooming,
On the meadow and the hill
How I long to gaze upon them,
And to be among them still,
But the joys of youth are gone,
And the cares of life abide,
Yet I love the merry springtime;
With a heart of childish pride,
Yet I love the merry springtime;
And "my early fireside."
