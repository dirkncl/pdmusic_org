1.
I am dreaming of the lov'd ones, 
  That have pass'd from earth to heav'n: 
Of the silken bonds of friendship, 
  Which by time's rough hands were riv'n. 
I am dreaming, fondly dreaming, 
  Of the happy days of yore; 
Of the joys that I have tastted, 
  Joys which I shall know no more.

2. 
Ah, my heart is fill'd with sorrow, 
  When I think upon the years 
That have left some pleasant mem'ries, 
  But, alas, how many tears. 
I have seen the fairest flowers 
  Blasted by the snows of fate; 
Brightest hopes all torn and scatter'd, 
  Hearts once glad left desolate.

3. 
Oh, I daily pray to heaven, 
  That I soon shall be at rest, 
With the cold earth for my pillow, 
  And the turf upon my breast; 
Yes, I would that I were lying 
  In the cold and silent tomb 
There is rest till I awaken, 
  Where hope's flow'rs forever bloom.
