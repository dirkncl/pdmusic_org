"We Met No More" (1871)
by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902
from "Home Joys for the Piano Forte
or Parlor Organ. Second Set." [#23]

1.
Far down where the river meets the sea
As the tide of the waters ebb'd away
My Madge in her sorrow turn'd to me
Saying thus wilt thou leave me in a day
And my heart shall be sinking on the tide,
When the smile like the waters shall be gone.
Oh say shall the ocean then divide
Our hearts that are beating now as one
Oh say shall the ocean then divide
Our hearts that are beating now as one.

CHORUS
But we met no more
By the sea-girt shore
On the banks of that beautiful river
For the angel of death
With a cold fatal breath
chill'd the heart of my darling forever.

2.
I told here the tide would return
And the wave on its journey bring me back
Her heart should rejoice again to learn
When my bark was upon the homeward track
And I told her that those from whom we part,
When fate should remove us far away.
Were sometimes much nearer to the heart
That those we are meeting ev'ry day
Were sometimes much nearer to the heart
That those we are meeting ev'ry day.

(CHORUS)

3.
The time of our parting came at last
And I sailed to a foreign port away
Hoping soon that my anchor should be cast
Once more where we parted on that day
But alas! then how little did I know
That after my journey shall be oe'r
My heart with sorrow should o'erflow
To learn that my darling was no more
My heart with sorrow should o'erflow
To learn that my darling was no more.

(CHORUS)
