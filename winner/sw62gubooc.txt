Words and Music by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
Give us back our Commander,
  Little Mac, the people's pride;
Let the army and the nation
  In their choice be satisfied.
With McClelland as our leader,
  Let us strike the blow anew;
Give us back our old Commander.
  He will see the battle through.

CHORUS
Give us back our old Commnader,
  Let him manage, let him plan;
With McClellan as our leader,
  We can wish no better man.

2.
Men may fight for fame and glory,
  Some may fight just "for the tin";
Give us then our noble leader,
  Let us fight, but fight to win.
Uncle Sam has lots of money,
  Mighty stores and many men,
Yet the people "think it funny"
  We should be repulsed again.

(CHORUS)

3.
Pope he made a dash for Dixie,
  Said he'd set the darkies free,
But he hasn't done already
  What we did espect to see.
Down upon the Rappahannock,
  Barnside went with army bold
Tho' repuls'd, he did his duty,
  Acting just as he was told.

(CHORUS)

4.
Congressmen may plain and twaddle
  How the fighting should be done;
Bull Run taught _them_ to skedaddle,
  Ely took too slow a run.
Editors! our men of wisdom?
  Lay the plan for Richmond's fall!
Greely knows just how McClellan
  Could have bag'd the rebels all.

(CHORUS)

5.
Down in Dixie he may lead us,
  We will follow any route;
Till the silly war department
  Gives the order---RIGHT ABOUT.
Lincoln's great on Proclamations,
  Stanton councils Uncle Sam,
Halleck does as their advisor,
  Fremount is a perfect sham.

(CHORUS)
