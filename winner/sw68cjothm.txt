1.
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines,
I often live beyond my means,
I sport young ladies in their teens,
  To cut a swell in the army.
I teach the ladies how to dance,
How to dance, how to dance,
I teach the ladies how to dance,
  For I'm their pet in the army.

SPOKEN. Ha! ha! ha!

CHORUS
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines,
I give my horse good corn and beans;
Of course it's quite beyond my means,
Tho' a Captian in the army.

2.
I joined my corps when twenty one,
Of course I thought it capitol fun,
When the enemy came then ran off I run,
  I wasn't cut out for the army.
When I left home mama she cried,
Mama she cried, mama she cried,
When I left home mama she cried,
  "He ain't cut out for the army."

SPOKEN. Ah, she thought I was too
young, but then, I said, oh! mama.

(CHORUS)

3.
The first day I went out to drill,
The bugle sound made me quite ill,
At the balance step my hat it fell,
  And that wouldn't do for the army.
The officers they all did shout,
They all cried out, they all did shout,
The officers they all did shout,
  "Oh, that's the curse of the army."

SPOKEN. Of course my hat did fall off,
but oh! nevertheless.

(CHORUS)

4.
My Tailor's bills came in so fast,
Forces me on day to leave at last,
And ladies too no more did cast,
  Sheeps' eyes at me in the army.
My creditors at me did shout,
At me did shout, at me did shout,
My creditors at me did shout,
  "Why kick him out of the army."

SPOKEN. I said, oh! gentlemen, oh! kick me out
of the army. Perhaps you are not aware, that

(CHORUS)
