1.
Good words may reach the truant heart
When harsh demands may fail
For whispers soft a calm impart
When stormy scenes prevail
Persuasion hath a winning way
That few can well can well resist
And gentle words asurer sway
Than harsher tones enlist
Persuasion hath a winning way
That few can well resist.

CHORUS
Good words are spoken not in vain,
But comfort with a pleasing art
They wake the welcome smiles again
And fall like blessings on the heart.

2.
Good words may move the erring heart
Rebellious tho' it be
And  tender smiles with gracious art
Awaken sympathy
Remember then a kindly word
In sweet in sweet forfiveness said
Is better far and surely heard
If not to feeling dead
Is better far and surely heard
If not to feeling dead.

(CHORUS)
