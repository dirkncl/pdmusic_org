1.
  Cheer up, Annie darling,
  With hopeful emotion;
Tomorrow our parting must be;
  I'll sail the seas over,
  I'll cross the wide ocean,
I'll sail the seas over thee,
  I will not forget thee,
  Ah, never! no, never!
I cannot forget thee, I know;
  Thy smile, like a phantom,
  shall haunt me forever
And cheer me whene'er I go.

CHORUS
  Goodby, Annie darling;
  Break off from thy sorrow;
'Tis sad that our parting must be;
  I'll sail the seas over,
  I'll cross the wide ocean,
I'll sail the seas over fro thee.

2.
  I go, Annie darling,
  But leave thee in sorrow,
I go for thy sake far away.
  Then bid be goodby
  With a smile on the morrow,
And cheer me with blessings, I pray.
  I'll think of thee ever,
  And pray of the only,
As over the waters I roam;
  I'll tarry not, darling,
  And leave thee all lonely,
But hasten again to my home.

(CHORUS)

3.
  Out, out on the ocean,
  Away o'er the billow,
My heart on its purpose still bent,
  My brow shall find rest,
  When I seek my lone pillow,
In knowing that thou art content.
  Cheer up, Annie darling,
  Break off from thy sorrow,
'Tis sad that our parting must be;
  But give me thy smile
  When I leave the tomorrow
To sail the seas over for thee.

(CHORUS)
