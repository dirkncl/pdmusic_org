1.
Young Samuel was tall,
  But mighty short of cash;
Adown his upper lip there hung
  A delicate moustache:
A ladies man indeed was he
  So handsome and so smart,
But Samuel this nice young man,
  Was very false at heart.

CHORUS
Then "Widders" all beware
  Of man false hearted man
And maidens do take care!
  To shun him if you can.

2.
A "widder" first he met,
  Whose weeds indeed were few;
And this poor "widder" really thought
  That Samuel was true:
But oh! alas this widder she
  Who hoped to be his bride
Discovered soon that he was false,
  Took "pizen" and she died.

(CHORUS)

3.
A maid he courted next,
  About a year or so;
And she was too, as fine a gal
  As ever had a beau,
But this poor maided she found out
  As many lovers do
That he was also false to her
  Altho' her heart was true.

(CHORUS)

4.
How could you treat me so
  Oh Samuel she cried
She fell and fainted in his arms
  And finally she died!
Her fate was very hard indeed
  And sad as it was true
Believe me if you will or not
  Her heart was broken too.
      (literally.) _broke in two._

(CHORUS)

5.
A "Widder" gone to rest!
  A foolish maiden too
Who "kicked the bucket" just because
  Her lover was not true,
Then ladies never let your hearts
  In early years -- or late --
Incline to man deceitful man
  He'll break it -- "sure as fate."

(CHORUS)
