"Listen to the Mocking Bird" (1855)
Melody by
Richard Milburn
Written and arranged by
Septimus Winner
[aka Alice Hawthorne]

1.
I'm dreaming now of Hally, sweet Hally, sweet Hally,
I'm dreaming now of Hally,
For the thought of her is one that never dies:
She's sleeping in the valley, the valley, the valley;
She's sleeping in the valley,
And the mocking bird is singing where she lies.

CHORUS
Listen to the mocking bird,
Listen to the mocking bird,
The mocking bird still singing o'er her grave.
Listen to the mocking bird,
Listen to the mocking bird,
Still singing where the weeping willows wave.

QUARTETTE
Listen to the mocking bird,
Listen to the mocking bird,
The mocking bird still singing o'er her grave.
Listen to the mocking bird,
Listen to the mocking bird,
Still singing where the weeping willows wave.

2.
Ah! well I yet remember, remember, remember,
Ah! well I yet remember,
When we gather'd in the cotton side by side;
'Twas in the mild September, September, September,
'Twas in the mild September,
And the mocking bird was singing far and wide.

(CHORUS)
(QUARTETTE)

3.
When the charms of spring awaken, awaken, awaken:
When the charms of spring awaken,
And the mocking bird is singing on the bough.
I feel like one forsaken, forsaken, forsaken.
I feel like one forsaken,
Since my Hally is no longer with me now.

(CHORUS)
(QUARTETTE)
