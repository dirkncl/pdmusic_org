To J. M. Dredger Esq.
"Let Us Cross Over the River" (1876)
(The last words of Stonewall Jackson.)
Song and Chorus.
Words [Poetry] by Alice Hawthorne
[pseud. for Septimus Winner]
Music by Septimus Winner, 1827-1902

1.
The Dove with her Olive branch cometh,
  "All's well" is the message she brings;
From the ark of my safety I welcome,
  The tidings of far better things.
The storm of contention is over
  And sunlight is streaming afar,
The dawn of a better day breaking,
  Dispelling the sorrows of war.

CHORUS
Then let us cross over the river,
  And rest 'neath the shade of the trees,
At last the sad struggle is over,
  And Peace bringeth quiet and ease.

2.
No more shall deluge of sorrow,
  O'erwhelm us with tears like a flood;
For the land that must rule us forever,
  Averteth the shedding of blood.
O shame on the one who shall open
  The wounds that are healing at last,
Bringing sorrow anew to the nation,
  Thro' sins that are over and past.

(CHORUS)

3.
The fruits of the past are accepted,
  The trial, that cross'd us is done--
The nation no longer divided--
  The people again are as one.
The Ruler of all hath divined it
  Let man, as his servant accept,
The widow and orphan shall praise Him
  Rejoicing e'en where they have wept.

(CHORUS)
