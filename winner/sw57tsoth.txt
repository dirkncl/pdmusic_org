1.
When I see the roses wither,
And the morning glories die,
I know the chilly season
On the year is drawing nigh;
But winter hath its pleasures
And many joys in store,
But I love the cheerful summer
And enjoy its beauties more,
  But I love the cheerful summer
  And enjoy its beauties more.

2.
When the maple leaves are yellow,
And the nights are cool and long,
I greet the cheerful cricket
With its melancholy song,
Yet the winter lies before me,
And when its storms are o'er
I hail the sunny summer
For I love its beauties more.
  I hail the sunny summer
  For I love its beauties more.

3.
And thus when youth is over,
When locks are thin and gray;
How sweet the recollection
Of momemts pass'd away;
Tho' friends and joys may lessen
As moments still depart,
How well we all remember
The summer of the heart.
  How well we all remember
  The summer of the heart.
