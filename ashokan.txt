Ashokan Farewell

This page is a special tribute to the composer, Jay Ungar, and his song, "Ashokan Farewell" (1983), which has so inspired many since its use as the Theme Song, for the Ken Burns' PBS miniseries ducumentary film "The Civil War" released in 1990, with words since written in 1991 by Grian MacGregor. It has become strongly identified with the Civil War era, and thus seems most fitting to include, with permission, my version of it here (as a hidden embedded file which will playback one time automatically). May you enjoy the music as much as I do.
