1. Mother! Oh sing me to rest,
As in my bright days departed
Sing to thy Child, the Sick Hearted,
Songs for a Spirit oppress’d,
Lay this head on thy breast,
Flow’rs from the Night dew are closing,
Pilgrims and Mournners reposing,
Mother Oh! Sing me to rest!
Sing me to rest, Sing me to rest.

2. Take back thy bird to its nest,
Weary is young Life when blighted,
Heavy this Love unrequited,
Mother Oh! sing me to rest.
Lay this head on thy breast.
Flow’rs from the Night dew are closing,
Pilgrims and Mourners reposing,
Mother Oh! Sing me to rest.
Sing me to rest, Sing me to rest.

3. Weary is young Life when blighted,
Heavy this Love unrequited,
Mother Oh! sing me to rest.
Lay this head on thy breast.
Flow’rs from the Night dew are closing,
Pilgrims and Mourners reposing,
Mother Oh! Sing me to rest.
Sing me to rest, Sing me to rest.
