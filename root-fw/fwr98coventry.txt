1.
The God who made both heaven and earth
And all that that they contain
Will never quit His steadfast  truth
Not make His promise vain.

2.
The poor and all oppressed by wrong
Are saved by His decree;
He gives the hungry needful food
And sets the captive free.

3.
By Him the blind receive their sight,
By Him the fallen rise;
With constant care, His tender love
All human need supplies.
