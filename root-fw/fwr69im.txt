"I'm Married!" (1869)
Words from the Scotch
Music by Frederick Woodman Root

1.
Now I'll whistle, now I'll sing;
Now I'll caper, now I'll fling;
Now the chairs about I'll wring,
For know you sir, I'm married.
Happy days have come at last.
All my doubts and fears have past.
All my cares behind are cast.
And fast and firm I'm married.
And fast and firm I'm married, I'm married.

2.
O, how happy I am now,
Happier than a prince I fear,
When I kiss he bonnie dear,
And think that I am married.
Bachelors, a stupid class,
Say they do not like a lass;
Weary may their moments pass,
Till sure that they get married,
Till once they get married, get married.

3.
Oh, the fool! he does not ken,
They are far the happier men.
Who a pretty lass her turn,
And kissed her and got married.
Never heed the want of gold.
If her form's of fatty mold,
Go to her and whisper bold,
"Sweet lassie, let's get married."
Sweet lassie, let's get married," "get married."

4.
She may say, "you're very Mate,
Thus to speak of such a rate;"
Never heed, for soon or late,
Full glad she's to be married.
Then you'll whistle, then you'll sing.
Then you'll caper, then you'll fling.
For it is a happy thing,
When one is really married,
When one is really married, is married.
