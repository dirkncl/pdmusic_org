1.
Bells of early morning,
Cheerily to labor calling me;
From refreshing slumber
Do I rise and haste to answer thee.

2.
Bells of Sabbath morning,
Soothingly thy tones salute mine ear,
Telling of the Father,
Who to all his own is ever near.

3.
Bells of Heav'nly morning,
Sweetly calling from a stormless shore,
Ye are best and dearest,
Voices of the lov'd ones gone before.
