"Poor Carlotta!" (1867)
(The last words of Maximilian.)
Words by Paulina.
Song and Chorus
Music by Frederic Woodman Root.

1.
Never a thought of the world he was leaving,
Naught of its glory, its gladness, or grieving.
Only of her, whom the stroke was bereaving--
Poor Carlotta, Poor Carlotta.

CHORUS
Much had he loved, and let much be forgiven,
Over the billows like star tempest driven,
Wild in its darkness, that young heart bereaven,
Poor Carlotta, Poor Carlotta.

2.
Faded away all his daydreams of splendor,
All the dishonor of love and surrender,
All but the homage a true heart would tender,
Poor Carlotta, Poor Carlotta.

(CHORUS)

3.
Death had he dealt, and such death was he reaping,
Night like its shadows around him were sweeping,
Yet, in his vigil young Love was unsleeping,
Poor Carlotta, Poor Carlotta.

(CHORUS)
