"Christmas Song No. 2" (1899)
Words by Lydia Avery Coonley
Music by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916
(from "Singing Verses for Children")

1.
Why do bells for Christmas ring?
Why do little children sing?
Once a lovely, shining star,
Seen by shepherds from afar,
Gently moved until its light
Made a manger cradle bright.

2.
There a darling baby lay,
Pillowed soft upin the hay,
And His mother sang and smiled:
"This is Christ, the Holy Child."
So the bells for Christmas ring,
So the little children sing.
