1.
Wake! the Holy Spirit calls thee,
From thy torpor now awake!
Calls thee to be up and doing,

Bear the cross for Jesus’ sake,
[B]Bear the cross for Jesus’ sake;

Hopeless, unforgiven sinners,
Perish at thy very doors,
While ye sleeping vinyard workers

Leave them dying, aye, by scores.
[B] Leave them dying, aye, by scores.  

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[Overlapping voices]
[SAB] Wake the Holy Spirit calls thee!
      From thy torpor now awake!
[T]   Wake awake.

[S]   Calls, 
      Bear thy cross for Je-sus’
[ATB] Calls thee to be up and doing, 
      Bear thy cross for Jesus’

[SB]  sake.
[AT]  for Jesus’ sake.

2.
Tell the story of redemption,
Of the precious love he had,
For the weary, heavy laden,

For the lonely and the sad,
[B] For the lonely and the sad.

How he died from sin to save us,
Of the thorns he wore,
Savior thine, O blessed Jesus,

Love divine for thee he bore.
[B] Love divine for thee he bore.   

3.
Struggling manhood stands in fetters
Welded by strong habit’s force,
Mind seems lost and love seems shattered,

Life but hopeless in its course.
[B] Life but hopeless in its course.

Tell the hopeless of the Savior,
Jesus whom the Father gave,
How in weakness he can strengthen,

How in anguish he can save.
[B] How in anguish he can save.
