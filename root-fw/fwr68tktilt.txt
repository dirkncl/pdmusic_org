1.
Thou knowest how each word of Thine
Hath pierc'd the soul before Thee;
Thou knowest how this heart of mine
Would in the dust adore Thee;
That it hath bow'd beneath thy rod
And owns no tho't above Thee;
Thou knowest all things, O my God,
Thou knowest that I love Thee.

2.
Thou knowest was counted dross,
As heaven's hopes drew nearer;
That I have borne the heavy cross,
Thy frail repentent hearer;
Thou knowest that my home, my all,
Was not enthron'd above Thee:
That I have harken'd in Thy call;
Thou knowest that I love Thee.

3.
Thou knowest what I cannot speak,
For grief my soul is filling;
Thou knowest that the flesh is weak,
The spirit truly willing;
That I wo'd tread where Thou hast trod,
Tho' ruin frown above Thee;
Thou knowest all things, Savior, God,
Thou knowest that I love Thee.
