O’er waiting harpstrings of the mind 
There sweeps a strain, 
Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind 
The pow’r of pain, 
And wake a whitewinged angel throng 
Of thoughts, illumed 
By faith, and breathed in raptured song, 
With love perfumed. 
Then His unveiled, sweet mercies show 
Life’s burdens light. 
I kiss the cross, and wake to know 
A world more bright. 
And o’er earth’s troubled, angry sea 
I see Christ walk, 
And come to me, and tenderly, 
Divinely talk. 
Thus Truth engrounds me on the rock, 
Upon Life’s shore, 
’Gainst which the winds and waves can shock, 
Oh, nevermore! 
From tired joy and grief afar, 
And nearer Thee, Father, where 
Thine own children are, I love to be. 
My prayer, some daily good to do 
To Thine, for Thee; 
An off’ring pure of Love, 
An off’ring pure of Love, whereto God leadeth me, 
whereto God leadeth me.
