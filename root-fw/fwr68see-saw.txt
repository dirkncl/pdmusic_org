"See-Saw" (9 June 1868)
by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916
from "Intermediate Course", No. 73
on page 90 of "The Triumph" by Geo. F. Root.

1.
Life is a see-saw board --- how we go
Away to the skies all sunny;
Downward, and never so swift, so low,
As when we have lost our money.

[CHORUS]
Life is a see-saw --- friend and foe,
Here-away, there-away, how they go,
Here-away, There-away, Here-away, There-away,
Here-away, there-away, how they go.

2.
He who exults on the upward plank
Too high for a recognition,
(Having near sight) has the poor to thank
For gaining his proud disposition.

(CHORUS)

3.
One and another are falling still
From ends that are nearest Heaven;
Friends who were faithful thro' good and ill,
And foes we have late forgiven.

(CHORUS)
