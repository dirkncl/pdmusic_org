with seven hymns written by Reverend Mary Baker
Eddy (Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science)"]

1. All power is given unto our Lord,
On Him we place reliance;
With truth from out His sacred word
We bid our foes defiance.
With Him we shall prevail,
Whatever may assail;
He is our shield and towere,
Almighty is His power;
His kingdom is forever.

2. Rejoice, ye people, praise His name;
His care doth e’er surround us.
His love to error’s thraldom came,
And from its chains unbound us.
Our Lord is God alone,
No other power we own;
No other voice we heed,
No other help we need;
His kingdom is forever.

3. O then give thanks to God on high,
Who life to all is giving;
The hosts of death before Him fly,
In Him we all are living.
Then let us know no fear,
Our King is ever near;
Our stay and fortress strong,
Our strengh, our hope, our song;
His kingdom is forever.
