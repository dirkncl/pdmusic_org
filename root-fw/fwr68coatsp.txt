1.
Along the silent path,
By contless spirits trod,
Another weary traveler,
Gone up to dwell with God.

2.
Gone up from human love,
To higher love and care,
From pain below to peace above,
In mansions, O so fair.

3.
Attune our hearts, O Lord,
Tho' they with sorrow swell,
To say this meek, submissive word,
Thou doest all things well.

4.
Fit us, O Lord, to go,
Or fit us here to stay;
That we may walk with Thee below,
Or up the silent way.
