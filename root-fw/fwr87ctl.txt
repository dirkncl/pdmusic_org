Words by M. W. T.
Music by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916
(from page 71 of "The Repertoire")

1.
Delicate white-tinted blossom,
Heavy with incense and dew,
Fragile, and lovely, and tender,
Long I've been seeking for you.

REFRAIN
Beautiful, beautiful lily,
Heaven-sent emblem to me;
No king in his golden grandeur
Was ever arrayed like thee.

2.
Pearly-hued petals uprearing,
Out of the damp marshy ground,
Vision of loveliness springing,
Where litle beauty is found.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Naught but the word of the Father
Clothed thee in garment so fair,
Breathed o'er thy petals their fragrance,
Shaped thee so wondrously fair.

(REFRAIN)

4.
Emblem of innocent sweetness,
Snowy-hued purity thou,
Homage I cheerfully render,
And to thy loveliness bow.

(REFRAIN)
