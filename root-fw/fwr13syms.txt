Saw ye my Saviour? 
Heard ye the glad sound? 
Felt ye the pow’r of the Word? 
’Twas the Truth that made us free, 
And was found by you and me 
In the life and the love of our Lord. 
Mourner, it calls you,— 
’Come to me bosom, 
Love wipes your tears all away, 
And will lift the shade of gloom, 
And for you make radiant room 
Midst the glories of one endless day.” 
Sinner, it calls you,— 
“Come to this fountain, 
Cleanse the foul senses within; 
’Tis the Spirit that makes pure, 
That exalts thee, and will cure 
All thy sorrow and sickness and sin.” 
Strongest deliver, friend of the friendless, 
Life of all being divine: 
Thou the Christ, and not the creed; 
Thou the Truth in thought and deed; 
Thou the water, the bread, and the wine, 
Thou the water, the bread, and the wine.
