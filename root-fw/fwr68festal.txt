1.
The festal morn, my God to come,
That calls me to thy sacred dome,
  They presence to adore;
My feet the summons shall attend,
With willing steps thy courts ascend,
  And tread the hallow'd floor.

2.
With holy joy I hail the day
That warns my thirsting soul away
  To dwell among the blest!
For, lo! my great Redeemer's pow'r
Unfolds the everlasting door,
  And leads me to his rest!

3.
Hither, from earth's remotest end,
Lo! the redeem'd of God ascend,
  Their tribute hither bring;
Here, crown'd with everlasting joy,
In hymns of praise their tongues employ,
  And hail th'immortal King.
