Seven Hymns Written by Reverend Mary Baker Eddy

1. Our God is Love, unchanging Love,
And can we ask for more?
Our prayer for Love’s increase is vain;
’Twas infinite before.
Ask not the Lord with breath of praise
For more than we accept;
The open fount is free to all,
God’s promises are kept.

2. Our God is Mind, the perfect Mind,
Intelligence divine;
Shall mortal man ask Him to change
His infinite design?
The heart that yearns for righteousness,
With longing unalloyed,
In such desire sneds up a prayer
That ne’er returneth void.

3. O loving Father, well we know
That words alone are vain,
That those who seek Thy will to do,
The true communion gain.
Then may our deeds our pure desire
For growth in grace express,
That we may know how Love divine
For ever waits to bless.
