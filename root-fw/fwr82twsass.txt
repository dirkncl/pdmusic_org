To Mrs. Celeste Keltie
"Through Winter Snow and Summer Shine" (1882)
Words by Fanny Rochat
Music by Frederick Woodman Root, 1846-1916
from "Three Songs", Op. 9, No. 2

1.
Spring is coming!
Summer's comming!
Tho' no busy bee is humming
No dove cooing,
No bird mating,
Only frost around, and skating
Though the sun's dull ruddy gleam
Finds no mirror in the stream,
Still reflected in the snow,
Shines the homely firelight's glow.

REFRAIN
All among the friends thou meetest
Mayst thou find the best and sweetest
Ev'ry earthly good be thine,
Through winter snow,
And summer shine; 
Ev'ry earthly good be thine,
thro' winter snow, and summer shine.

2.
Spring is coming!
Summer's coming!
Hear'st thou not the hush'd sweet humming
In the treetops
winds are telling,,
How each hour the buds are swelling
While in depths of icebound rivers
Joyfully the secret quivers
That the golden days are near,
When the birds sing spring is here.

(REFRAIN)
