Blest Christmas morn, though murky clouds 
Pursue thy way, 
Thy light was born where storm enshrouds 
Nor dawn nor day! 
Dear Christ, forever here and near, 
No cradle song, 
No natal hour and mother’s tear, 
To thee belong. 
Thou God-idea,  Life-encrown’d 
The Bethlehem babe— 
Beloved, The Bethlehem babe— 
Beloved, replete, by flesh embound—  
Was but thy shade! 
Thou gentle beam of living Love, 
And deathless Life! 
Truth infinite, so far above 
All mortal strife, 
Or cruel creed, or earthborn taint: 
Fill us today 
With all thou art— 
Fill us today 
With all thou art— be thou our saint, be thou 
Our stay [saint?], alway.
