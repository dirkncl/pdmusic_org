1. There are thoughts to fill the heart with gladness, 
That come with sunlight’s radiant beams; 
Aglow with life, 
The universe 
To miror forth supernal glory seems 
The flow’ry vale, the morntain’s height, 
All nature smiling, bright, 
Tell to mankind some wondrous sto0ry 
Of something more than mortal glory. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
O waiting heart, dost thou not know 
The truth that all these glories show? 
Through all that seems to sense so fair, 
The hand of God thou seest there! 

2. There are glad thoughts that come from silence, 
The hush of night, or solitude. 
In such an hour, the spirit seeks 
To know the real from phantoms that delude 
The mighty ocean calmed to sleep, 
The forest sient, deep, 
The dreaming world the heavens glowing, 
Some pow’r benign to man are showing.
