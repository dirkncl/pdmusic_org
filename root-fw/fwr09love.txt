Brood o’er us with Thy shelt’ring wing, 
’Neath which our spirits blend 
Like brother birds, that soar and sing, 
And on the same branch bend. 
The arrow that doth wound the dove 
Darts not from those who watch and 
If thou the bending reed wouldst break 
By thought or word unkind, 
Pray that his spirit you partake, 
Who loved and healed mankind: 
Seek holy thoughts and heav’nly strain, 
That make sure one is love remain. 
Learn, too, that wisdom’s rod is given 
For faith to kiss, and know; 
That greetings glorious from high heav’n, 
Whence joys supernal flow, 
Come from that Love, divinely near, 
Which chastens pride and earthborn fear, 
Through God, who gave that word of might 
Which swelled creation’s lay: 
“Let there be light, and there was light!” 
What chased the clouds away? 
’Twas Love whose finger traced aloud 
A bow of promise on the cloud. 
Thou to whose power our hope we give, 
Free us from human strife, 
Fed by Thy love divine we live, 
For Love alone is Life; 
For Love Love alone is Life; 
And life most sweet, as heart to heart 
Speaks kindly, when we meet and part, 
Speaks kindly, kindly when we meet and part.
