1. There are voices, holy voices
Coming from afar away;
They are always sounding near me,
And I hear them ev’ry day:
Yet my eyes with tears are brimming,
And my heart beats hard and fast,
While I listen to the voices,
Holy voices of the past.

2. There are voices, olden voices,
Which are speaking to me now;
And they stir the air so gently,
In the quiet of their flow;
That I listen, as if dreaming,
As they uninvited come,
Chiming faintly, chiming quaintly,
To the measure of sweet home.

3. There are voices, tender voices,
Speaking lower to me now;
There are lips whose warmth is burning
On my cheek and on my brow.
Hush! night sleeps upon the highlands,
List! it cannot be o’er long,
Ere from out the evezning silence
Floats the glory of a song.
