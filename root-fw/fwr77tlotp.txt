[Andante maestoso.]

The breaking waves dash'd high
On a stern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky
Their giant branches tossed;
And the heavy night hung dark,
The hills and water o'er,
When a band of exiles moor'd their bark
On the wild New England shore,
Not as the conqu'ror comes,
They the true hearted came;
Now with the roll of the strirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame!
Not as the flying come,
In silence and in fear;
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom,
With their hymns of lofty cheer,
With their hymns of lofty cheer.

A midst the storm they sang!
And the stars heard, and the sea!
And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang,
To the anthem of the free....
The ocean eagle soar'd
From his nest by the white wave's foam,
And the rocking pines of the forest roared;
This was their welcome home.

There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band;
Why had they come to wither there
Away from their childhood's land?

There was woman's fearless eye
Lit by her deep love's truth,
There was manhood brow severely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.

What sought they thus afar?
What sought they thus afar?
What sought they thus afar?

Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?

Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war,

The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
Bright jewels of the mine,
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?

They sough a faith's pure shrine!
Aye, call it holy ground,
The spot where first they trod;
They have left unstained what first they sought,
Freedom to worship God!
Aye, call it holy ground;
The spot where first they trod,
They have left unstained what first they sought,
Freedom to worship, to worship God,
Freedom to worship God,
Freedom to worship God!
