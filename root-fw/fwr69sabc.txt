1. The world grows old, and men grow cold
To each while seeking treasure,
And what with want, and care and toil,
We scarce find time for pleasure.
But never mind that is a loss
Not much to be lamented:
Life rolls on gaily if we will
But smile and be contented.

2. If we are poor and would be rich,
It will not be by pining;
No, steady hearts and hopeful minds
Are life’s bright silver lining.
There’s ne’er a man who’s dared to hope,
Hath of his choice repented:
The happiest souls on earth are those
Who smile and are contented.

3. When grief does come to rack the heart,
And fortune bids us sorrow,
From hope we may a blessing read,
And consolation sorrow.
If thorns may rise where roses bloom,
It cannot be prevented;
So make the best of life you can,
And smile and be contented.
