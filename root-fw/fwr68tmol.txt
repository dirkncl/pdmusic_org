Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,
and I shall keep it unto the end.
Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law;
Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law,
and I shall keep thy law;
Yes, I shall observe it with my whole heart,
Yes, I shall observe it with my whole heart,
Amen, Amen.
