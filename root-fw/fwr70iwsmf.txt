1. 
When the morn is bright and fair, 
When sweet songsters charm the air, 
I will lift my voice in pray’r, 
  I will seek my Father; 
Lest my feet should go astray 
From His pure and perfect way; 
Lest I grieve Him as I may, 
  I will seek my Father.

2. 
In the solitude apart, 
In the wilderness or mart, 
Oh, my sorely tempted heart, 
  I will seek my Father; 
In the darkness as the day, 
He shall be my Guide and Stay; 
I will lean on Him alway­­ 
  I will seek my Father.

3. 
When the ev’ning sun is red, 
When each blossom droops its head, 
Kneeling low beside my bed, 
  I will seek my Father; 
That I slumber in His care; 
Shielded from each harmful snare; 
And for life or death preparel 
  I will seek my Father.
