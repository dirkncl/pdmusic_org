You need not search for the sunshine bright.
You need not grope in the dark some night.
You need not wander without the light,
If you’ll open your eyes and see it;
You need not wander without the light,

Just open your eyes and see it;
You need not pine for music sweet,
And a doleful strain of your own repeat;
You need not pine for music sweet,
And a doleful strain of your own repeat;
You may know the sound of her beautiful feet,
You may know the sound of her beautiful feet,
If you ope’ your ears.
Just open your ears and hear it;
You may know the sound of her beautiful feet,
Just open your ears and hear it;

You need not sigh for the vanished May,
Or the cherished hopes that have flown away;
For you is the joy of a better day.
If you’ll open your heart and love it,
if you’ll open your heart,
If you’ll open your heart and love it,
if you’ll open your heart,
Just open your heart and love it:

You need not search for the sunshine bright,
You need not grope in the dark some night,
You need not wander without the light,
If you’ll open your eyes and see it;
Behold it,
  Open now your eyes and be bold.
You may now behold it,
You need not wander, without the light,
Just open your eyes and see it.
