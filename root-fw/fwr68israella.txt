1.
As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase;
So longs my soul, O God, for thee,
And thy refreshing grace.

2.
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Trust God; and he'll employ
His aid for thee, and change these sighs
To thankful hymns of joy.

3.
Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still; and thou shalt sing
The praise of him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.
