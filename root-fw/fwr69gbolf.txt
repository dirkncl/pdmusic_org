1. Come, let us gather ’round the hearth;
Lull ev’ry care to rest!
There is no spot o’er all the earth
With deeper loving blest,
’Tis here the face a smile may wear;
The heart may fill with pride,
And offer up to Heav’n the pray’r
God bless our loved fireside,
Our loved fireside,
God bless our loved fireside! 

2. The world without is chill and cold,
The winter skies are drear;
But homes that fond affection hold
Give welcome and good cheer;
So let us gather closer yet,
And heart to heart confide,
While in our pray’rs we ne’er forget,
God bless our loved fireside,
Our loved fireside,
God bless our loved fireside!

3. We’ve been together now for years,
Entwin’d in Love’s dear chains;
We’ve shared each others hopes and fears,
We’ve shared our joys and pains:
God keep our fam’ly circle whole!
Let naught our loves divide!
Oh! hear the longing of each soul,
God bless our loved fireside,
Our loved fireside,
God bless our loved fireside!
