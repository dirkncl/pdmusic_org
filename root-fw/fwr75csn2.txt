(Christmas.) by Handel.

1.
Awake my sould! stretch ev'ry nerve,
And press with vigor on.
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
A bright, immortal crown,
A bright, immortal crown.

2.
A cloud of witnesses around,
Hold Thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
And onward urge thy way,
And onward urge the way.

3.
'Tis God's all animating voice,
That calls thee from on high;
'Tis His own hand presents the prize,
To thine aspiring eye,
To thine aspiring eye.
