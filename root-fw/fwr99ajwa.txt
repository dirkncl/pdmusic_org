"As Joseph Was A-Walking" (1899)
Words by Charles Kingsley
Air by Lydia Avery Coonley
Harmonized by Frederic W. Root, 1846-1916

1.
As Joseph was a-walking,
He heard an angel sing,
"This night shall be the birth night
Of Christ our Heavenly King;
His birth-bed shall be neither
In housen nor in hall,
Nor in the place of Paradise,
But in the open stall.

He neither shall be rocked
In silver nor in gold,
But in the wooden manger
That lieth on the mould;
He neither shall be clothed
In purple nor in pall,
But in the fair white linen
That usen babies all.

2.
As Joseph was a-walking,
Thus dis the angel sing,
And Mary's Son at midnight
Was born to be our King;
Then be you glad, good people,
At this time of the year;
And light you up your candles,
For His star, it shineth clear.
