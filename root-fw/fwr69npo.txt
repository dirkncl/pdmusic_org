1. When e’er a duty waits for thee,
With sober judgment view it,
And never ifly wish it done;
Begin at once and do it.

2. For Sloth says falsely: “Byandby
Is just as well to do it;”
But present strength is surest strength:
Begin at once and do it.

3. And fear not lions in the way,
Nor faint if thotns bestrew it;
But bravely try, and strength will come,
Begin at once and do it.
