1. We are waiting for you, waiting,
And the darkness closes round,
As we listen for the coming
Of your foorsteps’ welcome sound.
O the hours are long and weary,
And without one ray to cheer,
When your pleasant smile, my darling,
Is not ever, ever near!

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
We are waiting for you waiting,
We are waiting, we are waiting,
We are waiting for you, waiting.
We are waiting.

2. Hasten homeward, hasten loved one,
Let me fold you by my arms;
Let me shield you from vexation
And the outer world’s alarms.
Let me smooth from off your forehead
All the marks of burning care,
And your weary, weary burden,
Oh, I pray you, let me share!

3. We are waiting for you, waiting,
And the stars are in the sky;
And the ev’ning hours are slowly,
O so slowly, passing by!
Hasten homeward, hasten darling,
For the night is wearing late,
Happy hour that hears your footstep,
Welcome footstep at the gate.
