Shepherd, show me how to go
O’er the hillside steep,
How to gather, how to sow,
How to feed thy sheep;
I will listen for thy voice,
Lest my footsteps stray;
I will follow and rejoice
All the rugged way.

Thou wilt bind the stubborn will,
Wound the callous breast,
Make well righteousness be still,
Break earth’s stupid rest.
Strangers on a barren shore,
Lab’ring long and lone,
We would enter by the door,
And Thou know’st Thine own;

So when day grows dark and cold,
Tear or triumphs harms, Lead
Thy lambkins to the fold,
Take them in Thine arms.
Feed the hungry, heal the heart,
Till the morning’s beam;
White as wool ’ere they depart,
Shepherd, wash them clean.
White as wool e’er they depart,
Shepherd, Shepperd,
Wash them clean.
