1.
'Neath the vine
Which does twine
By our door, a flower was found,
Modest, fair,
Standing there,
Off'ring its perfume.
By our door,
One flower more
Shed a blessing all around:
Little Sue,
Loving, true,
In her early bloom.
To the flower she gently said,
Tears her blue eyes filling,
"Don't you fear the stormy blast,
And the frost so chilling,
Sweet (Sweet flower!") flower!" (Sweet flower)
Sweet flower (Sweet flower)
Called she ten- (Come!) -derly, "Come
("Come and rest) rest (On my brest,)
love- (Pure and) -ly (lovely) flow- (flow'ret,) -'ret (come!)
Safe from ill,
You shall dwell
(in my) In my happy home; (Come home, Flow-)
Flow'ret dear, (-'ret)
Come home, (Come home, Dear-)
Dear (Flow-) -est flow- ('ret,) -'ret,
Come!"

2.
Now 'tis o'er!
By our door
That sweet voice no more is heard;
Ah! what gloom
Fills the home,
Since our angel's flight.
Like a flower,
In an hour
Called away by gentlest word;
She is gone!
And we mourn
For her presence bright.
For the gentle Shepherd said,
"Cold the world and dreary,
Flowers so fair can not endure,
Soon do they grow weary,
Sweet (Sweet flower!") flower!" (Sweet flower)
Sweet flower (Sweet flower)
Called He ten- (Come!) -derly, "Come
("Come and rest) rest (On my brest,)
love- (Pure and) -ly (lovely) flow- (flow'ret,) -'ret (come!)
Safe from ill,
You shall dwell
(in my) In my happy home; (Come home, Flow-)
Flow'ret dear, (-'ret)
Come home, (Come home, Dear-)
Dear (Flow-) -est flow- ('ret,) -'ret,
Come!"
