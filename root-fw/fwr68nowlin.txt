1.
Lowly and solemn be
Thy children's cry to thee,
  Father divine --
A hymn of suppliant breath,
Owning that life and death,
Owning that life and death
  Alike are thine.

2.
O Father! in that hour
When earth all succoring power
  Shall disavow,
When spear, and shield, and crown
In faintness cast down,
In faintness cast down,
  Sustain us thou!
