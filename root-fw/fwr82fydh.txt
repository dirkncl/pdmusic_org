"For You, Dearest Heart!" (1882)
from "Three Songs", Op. 9, No. 1
by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916

If I were a rose---fragrant and sweet,
with heart fill'd with purest, diamond dew,
I'd wrap me about in leafy retreat,
And quietly wait thy hurrying feet,
Then blush
And blossom
Then blush and blossom for you.

If I were a star with silv'ry light,
I'd shine with ra-diance ever new,
To guide your feet in the way aright,
All the long and weary night
Till morning
Should dawn,
Till morning should dawn for you.

If I were a violet hid in the mold
With never a leaf tip in view
Shrinking away from the chilling cold
Breathe me name my blue eyes unfold
All tear-wet and bright for you,
All tear-wet and bright for you;
For you! For you! For you!

If I were a bird with fleetest wing
I'd bid to this bleak land Adieu
And hie-me away where 'tis ever Spring
To drive care afar
As I'd sweetly sing
For you dearest heart!
For you dearest heart,
Dearest heart!

For you
dearest heart
For you dearest heart for you.
