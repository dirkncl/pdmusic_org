"Soft Floating on the Air" (1877)
Quartet and distant Chorus.
Words by James R. Murray.
Music by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916.

1.
[QUARTET]
Soft floating on the evening air
Come sweetest songs of praise,
As worshipers in yonder church,
Their tuneful voices raise;

They sing of better hands than this,
They sing of better love--
Of rest to come, and perfect bliss
In homes prepared above.

CHORUS
[QUARTET and CHORUS]
Hark! and floating on the air,
hark! hark! The evening song!
The evening song of praise,
hark! hark! hark! hark!

2.
[QUARTET]
And over all the singing band
Hangs heavenly peace tonight,
While unseen list'ners hover round
From anger homes of light;

"How gentle God's commands," that say,
"How kind his precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
And trust his constant care."

(CHORUS)

[by CHORUS only]
"How gentle God's commands," that say,
"How kind his precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
And trust his constant care."
