1. Over and over again the brook thro’ the meadow flows,
And over, and over, and over again,
The tireless mill wheel goes,
So the dews of morning must fall,
And the sun, and the summer rain
Must do their part, and perform it all
Over and over again.

2. Over and over again, no matter which way I turn,
I always may find in the great book of life
Some lesson I have to learn;
I must take my turn at the mill,
I must grind out the golden grain,
I must do my task with a right good will,
Over and over again.
