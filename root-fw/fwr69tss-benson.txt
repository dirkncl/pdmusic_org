1.
O, childhood's joys is very grate,
A swingin on his muther's gate,
A eatin candy till his mouth
Is all stuck up from north to south.
& other things he likes kwite well,
That I hadnt time just here to tell,
But if he is sent kwite a phool,
He'd rather go to singin skewl.

COARUS
O, the singin skewl's butiphool,
O, the singin skewl's butiphool,
If you'll have me for your teacher
I shall be a happy creecher
For I dote upon the singin skewl,
The sing-in skewl.
(The singin skewl, the singin skewl,
(The singin skewl, the singin skewl.)

2.
& it's considered very nice
To skate upon the fris up ice,
Unlest you chance to fall kerwhack,
& thereby, cos your hed to crack,
& hwen you go from home to dine,
A roasted Tirkey's very fine,
But still I think it's more joyfull,
To go-o-o to singin skewl.

(COARUS)

3.
Sum thinks that [nothing's?] [I?] so good,
As oisters roasted, fried or stood,
& others thinks, the pleasure's more,
A slidin on a smaller dore.
So sum thinks this & sum thinks that,
But all agree there's grater satisfaction to be always hed,
At sing singin skewl, as I hav sed.

(COARUS)

4.
O, sweet the breth of dosey morn,
A blowin sadly thru the korn,
While golden rays of mistic lite,
Is herd upon the dawn of nite.
But souperfine, extatick bliss,
You'll always find, a nover nite.
If you will only mind this rool,
& always go to singin skewl.

(COARUS)
