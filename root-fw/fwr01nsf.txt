"Never Say Fail" (1901)
Words by Charles Swain
Music by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916

1.
Keep pushing 'tis wiser that sitting aside,
And sighing and wishing and waiting the tide,
In life's earnest battle, they only prevail,

[REFRAIN]
Who daily march onward and never say fail,
Who daily march onward and never say fail.

2.
With an eye ever open, a tongue that's not dumb,
A heart that will never to sorrow succumb,
You'll battle and conquer, tho' thousands assail;

[REFRAIN]
How strong and how mighty who never say fail,
How strong and how mighty who never say fail.

3.
In life's rosy morning, in manhood's fair pride,
Let this be your motto your footsteps to guide:
In storm and in sunshine, whatever assail,

[REFRAIN]
We'll onward and conquer and never say fail,
We'll onward and conquer and never say fail.
