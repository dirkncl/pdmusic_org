"Salute" (1899)
Words by Lydia Avery Coonley
Music by Frederic Woodman Root, 1846-1916

1.
Our heads we give,
Our hearts we give,
To God and native land;
Our flag shall wave
Above the brave,
And greet our loyal band.

[REFRAIN]
Salute the stars,
Salute the bars,
For me and you,
Red, White, and Blue,
Red, White, and Blue.

2.
Hail, flag we love!
Wave high above
Out loving hearts and true,
On land and sea
Forever free,
Our Red, and White, and Blue.

(REFRAIN)
