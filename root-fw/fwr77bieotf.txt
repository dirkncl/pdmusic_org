Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord,
Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord,
Blessed is every one that walketh in His ways,
that walketh, that walketh in His ways.
For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands,
shall eat the labor of thine hands...
Happy, happy shalt thou be...
Happy, happy shalt thou be...
and it shall be well, shall be well with thee;
Happy shalt thou be, it shall be well with thee,
well with thee, well with thee.
