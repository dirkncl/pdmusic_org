1.
My thoughts surmount these lower skies,
And look within the vail;
There springs of endless pleasures rise--
The waters never fail.

2.
Light are the pains that nature brings:
How short our sorrows are:
When with eternal future things
The present we compare.

3.
I would not be a stranger still
To that celestial place,
Where I forever hope to dwell,
Near my Redeamer's face.
