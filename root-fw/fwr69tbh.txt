Gentle eyes we closed below,
Tender voices heard once more;
Smile and call us as they call,
On and onward still before.

Guided thus O, friend of mine!
Let of walk our little way;
Knowing by each beck’ning sign
That we are not quite astray.

Chase we still  with baffled feet,
Smiling eye and waving hand;
Sought and sucker soon shall meet,
Lost and found in Sunset Land.
