1.
Come weary souls, with sin distress'd,
Come and accept the promise'd rest;
The Saviour's gracious call obey,
And cast your gloomy fears away.

2.
Here mercy's boundless ocean flows,
To cleanse your guilt and heal you woes;
Pardon, and life, and endless peace,
How rich the gift! how free the grace!

3.
Dear Saviour, let thy pow'rful love
Confirm our faith, our fears remove;
O, sweetly reign in ev'ry breast,
And guide us to eternal rest.
