[Choir]
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall praise Thee.
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall praise Thee.

[Alto Solo]
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom,
and talk of Thy pow'r.

[Tenor Solo]
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom,

[Quartet (or chorus)]
they shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom,
and talk of Thy pow'r.

[Choir]
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall praise Thee.
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall praise Thee,

[Base Solo]
To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts,
and the glorious majesty of His kingdom.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.

[Quartet (or chorus)]
And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

[Chorus]
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall praise Thee.
All thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord, 
and Thy saints shall bless Thee.

[Choir and congregation]
1.
Great God how infinite art Thou!
What worthless worms are we,
Let the whole race of creatures bow,
And pay their praise to Thee.

2.
Thy throne eternal ages stood,
Ere seas or stars were made,
Thou art the everlasting God,
Who all the nations dread.

3.
Eternity with all its years,
Stand present in its view;
To Thee there's nothing old appears,
Great God, there's nothing new.

[(Another "Dundee Service" may be formed by using
the following Hymn with this Anthem.)]
1.
O God, we praise Thee, and confess
  That Thou, the only Lord
And everlasting Father, art,
  By all the earth adored.

2.
O holy, holy, holy Lord,
  Whom heavenly hosts obey,
The world is with the glory fill'd
  Of Thy majestic sway.
