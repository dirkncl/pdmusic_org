1. Did you ever look out on the beautiful west,
When the day with its labor and care sank to rest;
And over the sky like a banner was rolled
The clouds that had shadow’d the gateway of gold.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O, the gateway of gold is the beautiful west,
Thro’ whose shining portals are quiet and rest;
Some day we shall pass them to come no more,
From the mansions of God on the beautiful shore.

2. I love to look out on the sky, and to dream
That just thro’ the gateway the palaces gleam;
That God has prepar’d us in His happy land,
The mansions that wait us just over the strand.

3. I think of the angels that sing by the throne,
There God reigns in beauty and glory alone;
And sometimes I fancy I hear their sweet hymn,
As it floats thru’ the gateway when daylight is dim.

4. O, beautiful gateway! some day I shall go
To the land of my Father, its beauties to know;
And when He shall call me, I pray you unclose,
And let me pass into an endless repose.
