1.
'Tis the last rose of summer,
Left blooming alone;
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred
No rose bud is nigh,
To reflect back her blushes,
And give sigh for sigh,
To reflect back her blushes,
And give sigh for sigh.

2.
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one,
To pine on the stem;
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go sleep thou with them.
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
