"Beyond" (1870)
A Descriptive Song for Contralto or Base.
Words by C. C. Haskins.
Music by Frederick Woodman Root.

"You see sir, poor Mary, when her little Benny was drounded,
her wits went out like, and she spent most of her days a
talking to the waters; and one day sir, we found the poor
girl drounded sir, drounded! She had gone to her boy BEYOND."

Roaring and raving again, Oh sea!
Ranting and lashing thy foam at me;
Hear me and tell me thou terrible sea
Where hast thou hidden my boy from me, Great Sea?

Hear me and heed me that pray to thee,
Calmly imploring this boon of thee;
Deep are the wells of my anquish, Oh Sea!
Bring back my loved one, my boy to me, Great Sea!

Mercy, have mercy! my brain grows wild!
Heart, cease thy throbbing, bring back my child:
Look, sea, I'm kneeling, I'm calm and mild,
Give me my blue eyed, my beautiful child, Good Sea!

Mocking, deriding my prayer to thee,
"Fruitless thy pleading" thou sayest to me;
Laughing thy deep laugh so loud and free,
Wilt thou not listen one moment to me, Good Sea?

Loved boy, my lost one, I'm coming to thee!
Soon shall we meet again under the sea;
Father in Heaven have mercy on me,
Guide me, dark waters, my soul to free, Good Sea.

Still roll the wild waves as aye before,
She that was weeping may weep no more,
Drowned in thy turbulant waves that roar,
Rests not the soul on the bright shining shore,
on the bright shining shore, Great sea?

Rests not the soul on the bright shining shore,
Great Sea?
