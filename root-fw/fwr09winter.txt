1.
Cold Winter comes with angry look,
And from the frozen North
Summons his clans to seal each brook
And drive each comfort forth,
Then in a chariot of snow
Rides over land and sea;
Although it speaks of wreck and woe,
It's good enough for me!

2.
Old Winter wears a sullen frown
And has a stormy breath;
Wea[r]ing  pride his icy crown
He dooms the land to death.
Fearing his devastating might,
Some to the Southland flee;
Well, let the fearful take their flight!
He cannot frighten me!
