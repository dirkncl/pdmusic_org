"O Let Me Be a Blonde, Mother!" (1872)
Modern Ballad Valse
Words by Grace H. Horr
Music by Frederick Woodman Root

1.
I know I'm called a gay brunette,
With jetty, curly hair;
But O, I'm weary of dark curls,
And wish that they were fair;
O I must be a blond, Mother,
O let me be a blonde!
O I must be a blond, Mother,
O let me be a blonde!

REFRAIN
Do Ma! Please Ma! Now Ma!
Let me be a blonde!

2.
There's little swarthy Katie Jones,
O no one calls her fair;
Was bleached and blanched for just three days,
And now has yellow hair;
Just think of Katie Jones, Mother,
And let me be a blonde!
Just think of Katie Jones, Mother,
And let be be a blonde!

(REFRAIN)

3.
And Fred-eric Jones who waits on me,
You think of me he's fond;
But oft I find him slighting me,
And smiling on a blonde;
You surely won't say no, Mother,
But let me be a blonde!
You surely won't say no, Mother,
But let me be a blonde!

(REFRAIN)

4.
You know that when to Lucy Brown
A knew hat was denied,
She threw herself in Dreamer's Lake,
And sank beneath the tide!
Remember Dreamer's Lake, Mother,
And let me be a blonde!
Remember Dreamer's Lake, Mother,
And let me be a blonde!

(REFRAIN)
