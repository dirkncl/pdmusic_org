1.
It never pays to fret and growl
When distant fortune seems our foe;
  The better bred
  Will push ahead
And strike the braver blow.

[CHORUS]
  For luck is work
  And those who shirk
Should no lament their doom,
  But yield the play
  And clear the way
That better men have room.

2.
It never pays to wreck the health
In drudging after gain,
  And he is sold
  Who thinks that gold
Is cheapest bought with pain.

[CHORUS]
  An humble lot,
  A cosy cot,
Have tempted even kings;
  For station high
  That wealth will buy,
Not oft contentment brings.

3.
It never pays! a blunt refrain,
Well worthy of a song,
  For age and youth
  Must learn this truth,
That nothing pays that's wrong.

[CHORUS]
  The good and pure
  Alone are sure
To bring prolong'd success,
  While what is right
  In heaven's sight
Is always sure to bless.
