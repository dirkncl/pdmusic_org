1. You are lying low down in you grave, darling, 
With the mould creeping over your face, 
And sadly the green willows wave, darling, 
And sigh o’er your lone resting place. 
You left us when summer was throwing 
O’er earth her bright mantle of flowers, 
But we knew in our hearts you were going 
To a land that is fairer than ours. 
Yes, Mary, dear Mary, 
To a land that is fairer than ours.

2. We ne’er can forget the sweet smiling darling,
That shed over all its bright ray.
It illumined our pathway awhile, darling,
Then failed forever away,
Like the mists of the morning in summer
Speeding upward to welcome the light,
So thy spirit without e.em a murmer
Passed on in its heavenly flight.
Yes, Mary, they spirit,
Passed on in its heavenly flight.

3. How oft when I’m weeping alone, darling,
And weary and sad seems the day,
In fancy I hear a low tone, darling,
That bids me chase madness away;
Perchance ’tis thy spirit that lingers,
And the zephyr that floats o’er me now
Is the touch of thine angel fingers
Pressing softly my poor aching brow.
Yes, Mary, dear Mary,
A voice in my heart tells me so.
