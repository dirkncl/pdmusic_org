1. Twas down at Parson Jones’s house, 
The gals, they had a quiltin, 
Just for to show their handsome looks, 
And have a little jiltin. 
There was deacon Parson’s darter Sal, 
Squire Wheeler’s darter Marry, 
And Corporal Carter’s youngest gal, 
That looked just like a fairy.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Yankee lasses are 
the universal earth bewitching 
They’re good, and true, and handsome too, 
in parlor and in kitchen.

2. There was Johnny White, and Pheby Brown, 
And Parson’s darter Betty, 
Jane Ann Pinkroot and Prudence Short, 
And Captain Downings Hetty. 
But if there was a handsome gal 
To make a feller’s heart right.
I guess it was by all accounts 
Miss Caro liner Carwright.

3. Wal, while we was  a whilin plate, 
And playin hunt the slipper, 
Jerusha Parsons went to get 
Some cider in a pitcher. 
But just as she had left the room 
And got in to the entry, 
She gave a scream and stood stock still 
Just like a frozen sentry. 

4. We all run out, and there I swow
Both buggin like creation
Miss Cartwright and Sammy Jones
A kissing like tarnation.
Oh such a laugh as we set up,
You never heard a finer.
Say’s I, I reckon kissin’s cheap,
Dont you, Miss Caroliner?

5. I wish you’d seen Miss Cartwright blush
Just like as if she painted,
She said she’d had the Cholic
And into Sam’s arms had fainted.
And now young gals, I’d say to you
When ever you go to a frolic,
Dont let your fellers kiss and hug
Unless you’ve got the Cholic.
