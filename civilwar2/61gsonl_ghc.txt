1. O lovers and defenders
Of Freedom’s holy cause!
By no unjust surrenders
Yield Union, State, or Laws.
Our Banner do not alter,
Respect the Nation’s choice;
Should one brave heart e’er falter,
Hear all the people’s voice:

[REFRAIN 1-3.]
God Save our Native Land,
Each loyal state and band.
Each faithful heart and hand,
United forever!

CHORUS 1-3.
God save our native land,
Each loyal state and band,
Each faithful heart and hand,
United forever!

2. O lovers and defenders
Of Order, Heav’n’s first law!
Blast all that still engenders
One thought in treason’s awe!
Keep up the old connection
From Florida to Maine;
Our States in true affection
Bind with a golden chain.

3. O lovers and defenders
Of precious hearts and homes!
Guard well their mild sweet splendors
From ev’ry rogue that roams!
Heav’n bid all sinful passion
Depart from human breast;
Bid Virtue be in Fashion,
Thy love control the rest.
