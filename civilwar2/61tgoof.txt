1. Oh say can you see by the dawn’s early light, 
The gift of our father’s with stars gleaming bright;
It waved o’er the strife where in conflict they stood, 
An emblem of victory babtized in blood!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then come let us spring to— come let us cling to— 
Come let us sing to—  the flag of the free;
And swear by our lives it shall float in the breeze— 
Our Idol at home and our pride on the sea!

2. On the shore dimly seen through the mist on the deep,
The creatures of treason their dark vigils keep;
Foresworn of their fathers they revelled in shame—
When Sumpter was girdled with famine and flame!

3. Oh where is that band— who so vainfully swore,
The gift of our fathers should glory no more?
The spirit of WASHINGTON breaks from the skies—
And true hearts by thousands in armor arise!

4. Oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
In honor defending the laws of the land;
With the old flag above us in glory unfurled,
Our UNION shall live as a light to the world!

5. Rise daughters of freedom, and strenghthen the arm,
Of husbands and brothers to shield it from harm;
’Tis the gift of our fathers, the boon of our trust,
The hope of our children, and prayer of the just!

6. Then spring to the struggle ye brave men and true,
And strike for our FLAG with its union of blue,
Not a star blotted out by a renegade blow—
It shall wave as of yore in the face of the foe!
