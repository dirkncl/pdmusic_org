1. Up darkies, up, and take your gun,
And fight for liberty,
I hear a voice from Washington,
Proclaim de darkies free,
Shake off de bonds to which you bow,
De shackle cuff and chain,
De bressed day which cometh now,
May neber come again.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We go, we go, to strike a blow,
For de old Red, White and Blue,
To help de Yankies in de fight,
For dey fight for me and you.
We go, we go, to strike a blow,
For de old Red, White and Blue,
To help de Yankies in de fight,
For dey fight for me and you.

2. Old massa now must hide him’s head
While we can face dellight,
For fader Abe (God bless him) said,
Dat darkies all may fight.
So in de battle field we’ll stand,
To let de white folks know,
Dat bullets fired by darkies hand,
Can lay de rebels low.

3. While freedom’s sons in battle drop
It surely am not fair,
Dat darkies stay in barber’s shop
To finger misses hair,
No one will rally in our might
And wid a sturdy blow,
We’ll put de rebels all to fight,
Or send dem down below.

4. De union flag we’ll gader round,
Come rally one and all;
And when de charge, de bugle sound,
We’ll answer to de call—
Den wid de stars and stripes o’erhead
We’ll shout for victory;
And fight till rebels all be dead,
And darkies all be free.
