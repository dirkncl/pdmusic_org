1. Oh! the banner of Columbia’s glorious land,
  Our hope by land and by sea;
The flag that was borne by the patriot band,
  When they fought for our dear Liberty;
With patriots to guard our banner so bright,
  And our volunteers so brave;
Undaunted we’ll rush in the midst of the fight,
  Our glorious Union to save.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then up with the banner that has waved so long,
Our glory on land and on sea,
We will fight for it ever and praise it with song,
Ensign of the Union and free.
Ensign of the Union and free.

2. Arise then bold patriots and let your flag wave,
  And swear to protect it for ever;
For freedom we’ll fight till we sink in the grave,
  Before our loved Union shall sever,
Then up with a will and protecxt your bright flag
  From traitors and vile usurpation;
We will ne’er let the South of Secession make brag,
  Or let them divide our great nation.

3. Up! up, Sons of Freedom unite in one band,
  And fight for the land of your birth;
We’ll swear by our banner and country to stand,
  And crush all rebellion to earth;
The memory of our patriots shall last,
  And our Eagle that soars through the sky,
No traitor, or rebel, our country shall blast,
  While the Flag of our Union shall fly.
