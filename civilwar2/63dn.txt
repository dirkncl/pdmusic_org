1. Oh Nelly was a darling girl, and loved by ev’ry one, 
Her dark blue eyes and flaxen curls 
Were sparkling, were sparkling in the sun; 
But now, dear Nelly’s far awy and I’m left here to mourn 
To pass in sadness weary days 
And long and long for her return.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then dearest Nell, come back to me 
I’ve something sweet to tell 
Then dearest Nell, come back to me, 
And we will happy be come back, come back, 
Oh dearest Nell come back.

2. We sought her long, we sought her well,
But ne’er could find a trace
Of the dear one, whose magic’s spell
Made home, made home, joy’s dwelling place,
She’s gone, she’s gone, I know not where,
I miss her from my side,
She’s gone, she’s gone, and in despair
I mourn and mourn my promised bride. 

3. But still I hope that I shall meet
My dearest Nell again;
Her presence now, would banish all
That brings my, brings my bosom pain.
I loved her, when in maiden pride,
She mingled in our glee,
I love her still, tho’ my side
Dear Nelly ne’er and never may be.
