1. The traitor’s knock is at thy door;
  Delaware; My Delaware!
Let not his foot polute thy floor;
  Delaware; My Delaware!
O canst thou basely cast aside,
Thy glory past, thy boast, thy pride,
The boon for which thy children died;
  Delaware; My Delaware! 

2. Thou first didst join the patriot band;
  Delaware; My Delaware!
And thou wilt by the Union stand;
  Delaware; My Delaware!
Firm hast thou been, and e’er will be;
My faith, my trust, I place in thee,
Thou art my mother, dear to me;
  Delaware; My Delaware!

3. Come, in thy beauty bright and stong;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
Thou canst not sell thy soul to wrong;
  Delaware, My Delaware;
Remember Kirkwood’s sacred trust;
Remember Haslet’s warlike thrust;
And all thy heroes in the dust;
  Delaware; My Delaware;

4. Thou wilt not how thee in the dust!
  Delaware; My Delaware;
Nor let the sword of vengence rust;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
Remind thee of thy children’s gore,
That stained Car’lina’s soil of yore;
And raise the battle cry once more;
  Delaware; My Delaware;

5. Those patriots rise before me now;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
The damp of death is on their brow,
  Delaware; My Delaware;
And list! they speak! their words inspire;
“We come from Camden’s conflict dire,
From strife, and groans, and blood, and fire,
  Delaware; Our Delaware;”

6. “We come from Yorktown’s strife and toil,
  Delaware; Our Delaware;
From Brandywine, our own loved soil
  Delaware; Our Delaware;
For thee at Eutaw Springs we bled,
The ‘sacred soil’ our veins have fed,
Virginia bolds thy hallowed dead,
  Delaware; Our Delaware;”

7. They rise to join the Union throng!
  Delaware; My Delaware;
And “death to traitors” is their song;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
Huzza! we’ll join the noble strain,
That rings amid the woods of Maine;
While Pickens echoes back again,
  Delaware; My Delaware;

8. Our mother spurns the traitors chain;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
Our country does not call in vain,
  Delaware; Dear Delaware;
She meets her sisters on the plain;
“Our Union” ’Tis the proud refrain,
That baffles treason back amain;
  Delaware; My Delaware;
