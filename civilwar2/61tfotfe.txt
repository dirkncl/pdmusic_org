1. Over land and seas let it kiss the breeze, 
For the smile of approving heaven 
Shall gleam in love from the realms above 
On the flag of the free Eleven, 
On the flag of the free Eleven, 
Where the blue of the firm and true 
Joins the stainless white of the pure and bright 
With the red, of our lifeblood’s hue.

2. Let the shout arise to the vauled skies, 
The South and the cherish’d Right! 
No vandal band shall polute our land: 
In a sacred cause we light 
’Neath the flag of the free Eleven, 
Where the blue of the firm and true 
Joins the stainless white of the pure and bright 
With the red, of our lifeblood’s hue.

3. Though the gory rains tell of thousands slain, 
’Twill cement in the crimson seal 
Oh! a band of peace when our waring’s cease 
And the foe at our feet shall kneel, 
Then the flag of the free Eleven, 
Let us bless with its blue so true, 
And its stainless white of the pure and bright 
And its red, of our lifeblood’s hue.
