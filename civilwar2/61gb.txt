Oh, keep your hat upon your head,
Oh, keep your hat upon your head,
Oh, keep your hat upon your head,
  For you will want it when your dead.

CHORUS
If you belong to Gideon's band,
Oh, here's my heart and here's my hand,
If you belong to Gideon's band,
Were're hunting for a home.

Oh, keep your nose upon your face,
Oh, keep your nose upon your face,
Oh, keep your nose upon your face,
  For anywhere else is out of place.

(CHORUS)

Oh, keep your coat upon your back,
Oh, keep your coat upon your back,
Oh, keep your coat upon your back,
  That you may be off on the other track.

(CHORUS)

4.
Oh, keep your pants upon your legs,
Oh, keep your pants upon your legs,
Oh, keep your pants upon your legs,
  That you may hang 'em on the golden pegs.

(CHORUS)

Oh, keep your shoes upon your feet,
Oh, keep your shoes upon your feet,
Oh, keep your shoes upon your feet,
  That you may walk in the golden street.

(CHORUS)

Oh, stick your toe-nails in the ground,
Oh, stick your toe-nails in the ground,
Oh, stick your toe-nails in the ground,
  That when you're wanted you may be found.

(CHORUS)

Oh, keep your money in your pocket,
Oh, keep your money in your pocket,
Oh, keep your money in your pocket,
  So when it's wanted you've not forgot it.

(CHORUS)

'Twixt you and I, I really think,
'Twixt you and I, I really think,
'Twixt you and I, I really think,
  It's pretty near time to take a drink.

(CHORUS)
