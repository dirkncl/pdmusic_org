1.
Up! and arm! war's domination
 Deepens on our native shore;
Shall our name amid the nations
 Be beloved and fear'd no more?
What our father's died to gain
 Shall not we their sons maintain?

CHORUS (ad lib) [sung after each verse]
The Republic, comrades brave,
Let us leave our all, to save!
The Republic-- comrades brave--
Let us leave our all, to save!

2.
Our old flag that to surrender
 Never stooped by land or sea
Shall it shorn of half its splendor
 To the world a byword be?
Seven long years of blood and toil
 Waved it faithful o'er our soil.

3.
Peacefully they sleep and coldly
 Who for us and freedom fell,
Shall the cannon's thunder, boldly
 Echoing o'er their lone graves tell
That the land for which they toiled
 Lies dishonored and despoiled?

4.
They whose oath was to befriend her
 Silent at a distance stand.
And the arms which should defend her
 Glitter in the rebel's hand:
Shall we be less prompt than they?
 On, where duty points the way--

5.
Hushed be every party feeling
 That an hour's delay could make,
Ruin's hour is on us stealing.
'Tis our country is at stake:
What a proud past did bestow
 We, to a proud future owe.

6.
Vainly will the false endeavor
 Our firm councils to divide,
Victory is with UNION ever,
 And our God is on our side;
Fighting as our father's fought
 To sustain the work they wrought--
