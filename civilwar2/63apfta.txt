1.
For the absent ones afar 
On the battle field we pray, 
Far from us, yet near to thee, 
Guard and shield them on their way. 
Guard and shield them on their way. 
Fa-ther, hear our earnest prayer. 
Fa-ther, hear our earnest prayer, 
Grant them all Thy tender care, Thy tender care, 
Grant them all Thy tender care.

2.
Holy Spirit, God of Love, 
Ru-ler of the sea and land. 
Hold our loved ones through the strife 
In the hollow of Thy hand. 
In the hollow of thy hand. 
Oh! benignant Saviour! hear 
Oh! benignant Sav-iour! hear 
This our earnest heart-felt prayer, our heart-felt prayer, 
This our earnest heart-felt prayer. 

3.
Thou whose voice rebuked the storm, 
End this melancholy strife, 
Peace and unity restore, 
Without further loss of life, 
Without further loss of life, 
Millions, then to thee will raise 
Millions, then to thee will raise 
One united song of praise, song of praise, 
One united song of praise.
