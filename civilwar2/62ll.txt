1. With the grace of the fawn
  At breaking of morn,
O’er the sweet scented lawn
  With tresses unshorn
Is seen lightly tripping
  With blue laughing e’e,
Ere the sun, dew is sipping,
My fair Lizzie Lee!
  Ere the sun, dew is sipping,
  My fair Lizzie Lee!

2. Yet a teardrop oft steals
  Unknown o’er her cheek,
If her secret reveals,
  Yet bashful and meek
She turns to hide blushes
  While in her blue e’e,
The teardrop still gushes,—
Fair, sad Lizzie Lee!
  The teardrop still gushes,—
  Fair, sad Lizzie Lee!

3. Ah! false is her lover—
  False, false to his vow,
A shade you discover
  Upon that fair brow;
Art need she not borrow,
  To light up her e’e,
It hides not the sorrow
Of sad Lizzie Lee!
  It hides not the sorrow
  Of sad Lizzie Lee!
