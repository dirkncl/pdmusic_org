1. Oh! mother dear, I sigh in vain,
To, live my childhood o’er again
And see thy clear, lovebeaming eye
Outshine the stars up in the sky;
Oh, mother, dear! bright sunny rays,
That give such joy and heav’nly bliss,
As by thy knee I used to pray,
Or climb’d to steal affection’s kiss.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! mother, dear, I sigh in vain
To live my childhood o’er again,
And see thy clear, lovebeaming eye,
Outshine the stars up in the sky,
Oh! mother dear!
Oh! my mother dear.

2. Oh! mother dear, those early scenes,
The flow’ry fields and meadows green
As thoughts come back I heave a sigh,
And wish for happy days gone by;
Long since I left my native shore,
But now my heart beats just as then,
Tho’ miles of sea between us roar,
Dear mother, I’ll come home again.
