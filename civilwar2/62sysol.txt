1.
America, bright land of liberty! the home of freemen brave!
Thy stars and stripes shall never cease o'er this fair land to wave;
America! bright land of liberty! your cause is ever just!
On, onward to the battle field, in God forever trust.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Strike! Strike! ye Sons of Liberty!
Fight! Fight! fight for your country's cause,
Strike! Strike! ye Sons of Liberty!
Strike! Strike! strike for your nation's laws!

2.
Let freedom ring again throughout the land, let millions swell the strain;
To victory! to victory, march on with might and _main,_
Make traitors feel th'evenging power of steel as we in battle fight;
Drive back the horde! unsheath the sword, and onward in our might.

3.
No! no! ne'er yield till every star and stripe [floats?] o'er our native land,
Till hill and dale with shouts prevail for our victorous band,
No! no! ne'er yield till every nation feels that we are in the right,
That [?] is just-- in [?] we trust, as we march on to fight.
