1. Our Country forever; on the folds of her Flag
This motto of freemen is blazoned full high:
Run up the proud ensign, from the loftiest crag
Of Liberty’s steep let it float to the sky,
Float freely forever,
Our Banner of Stars;
Wave, wave on the breath
Of freemen’s huzzas.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Our Country for ever, let time tell the story,
Our Country forever, unendind her glory,
Huzza! huzza! huzza! huzza!

2. Our Country forever; the slogan of battle
When called to defend our altars and homes;
The artillery’s roar and musketry’s rattle
Shall echo the theme in conquering tones.
Float freely forever,
Our Banner of Stars;
Wave, wave on the breath
Of freemen’s huzzas.

3. Our Country forever; when peace pipes its lay,
And the soft dulcet notes are pulsing the air,
With pride we will bless thee, with gratitude pray
That millions unborn in thy blessings may share.
Float freely forever,
Our Banner of Stars;
Wave, wave on the breath
Of freemen’s huzzas.

4. Our Country forever; glad voice of the nation,
Whose Liberty cost the rich ransom of blood;
Heaven hasten the day of the world’s liberation,
When Freedom shall triumph on field and on flood.
Float freely forever,
Our Banner of Stars;
Wave, wave on the breath
Of freemen’s huzzas.

5. Our Country forever; we swear ’neath the blue,
Thy name and thy fame bright and spotless shall be,
Thine honor we’ll guard— hearts and hands ever true,
Columbia! we owe all and give all to thee!
Float freely forever,
Our Banner of Stars;
Wave, wave on the breath
Of freemen’s huzzas.
