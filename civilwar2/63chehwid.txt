1. Close his eyes; his work is done! 
What to him is friend or foeman; 
Rise of moon, or act of sun, 
Hand of man or kiss of woman! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Lay him low, lay him low, 
Under the clover or under the snow; 
What cares he?  he cannot know; 
Lay him low. Lay him low. 

2. As man may, he fought his fight, 
Proved his truth by his endeavor; 
Let him sleep in solemn night, 
Sleep forever and forever. 
Lay him low. Lay him low. 

3. Fold him in his country’s stars; 
Roll the drum and fire the volley! 
What to him are all our wars. 
What but death bemocking folly?
Lay him low. Lay him low. 

4. Leave him to God’s watching eye; 
Trust him to the Hand that made him. 
Mortal love weeps idly by; 
God above has pow’r to save him. 
Lay him low. Lay him low.
