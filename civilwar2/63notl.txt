Ballad.
Words adapted by A. H. G. Richardson
Music arranged by William B. Harvey
and C[ornelius]. Everest [1820-1885+]

1.
No one to love, none to caress,
Roaming alone through this world's wilderness,
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown,
For in my sorrow I'm weeping alone;
No gentle voice, no tender smile,
Makes me rejoice, or cares bequile.

[REFRAIN]
No one to love, none to caress,
Roaming alone through this world's wilderness,
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown,
For in my sorrow I'm weeping a lone;


2.
In dreams alone, loved ones I see,
And well-known voices then whisper to me;
Sighing I wake, waking I weep;
Soon with the loved and the lost I shall sleep.
Oh, blissful rest! what heart would stay,
Unloved, unbless'd, from heaven away?

(REFRAIN)

3.
No one to love, none to caress,
None to respond to this heart's tenderness!
Trusting I wait; God in his love
Promises rest in his mansions above;
Oh! bliss in store, oh, joy mine own,
There nevermore to weep alone!

(REFRAIN)
