"Union and Liberty" (1861)
(National Anthem)
Words by Philip F. Snyder
Music by Gustave Blessner

1.
Union and Liberty!
Sons of the free,
Shall e'er our motto be,
In freedom's land.
By them our father's won,
Under great Washington,
This best land 'neath the sun,
From tyrant's hand.

CHORUS
By them our father's won,
Under great Washington,
This best land 'neath the sun,
From tyrant's hand!

2.
Flag with the stripes and stars
Not "Stars and Bars,"
America's brave [s]tars
Will proudly wave.
Where ever wind and tide,
Floats our grand navy's pride
Over the waters wide,
To trade or save.

CHORUS
Where ever wind and tide,
Floats our grand navy's pride
Over the waters wide,
To trade or save.

3.
When wars dread call we hear,
Like trumpet clear,
Whether our foe be near,
Or on the sea;
Beneath that flag we'll fight,
With all our heart and might,
While God smiles on the sight,
For Libery!

CHORUS
Beneath that flag we'll fight,
With all our heart and might,
While God smiles on the sight,
For Libery!

4.
As through the years of time,
In ev-ery clime,
Our motto, just sublime,
Sheathes the sharp sword;
Then o're this earthly ball,
Freemen are brothers all,
Shall to each other call,
"Praise ye the Lord!"

CHORUS
Then o're this earthly ball,
Freemen are brothers all,
Shall to each other call,
"Praise ye the Lord!"
