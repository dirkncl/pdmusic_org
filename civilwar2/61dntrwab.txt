1. Our glorious Banner is waving,
Around  us its folds gently fall,
In the conflict how nobly ’tis braving!
And gallantly dreams over all
Who its stars and its stripes are defending,
’Mid the perils of battles array,
Where each patrior soldier is sending
A terror to foes in the fray!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Defend now the Red, White and Blue!
Defend now the Red, White and Blue!
We’ll stand by the Union for ever—
Defend now the Red, White and Blue!

2. Remember the days long departed,
Remember the Sires who have died,
When at Concord those brave noble hearted
Oppression so sternly defied,
Shall the sons of those heroes surrender
To traitors our glorious land,
Then rally each patriot defender,
And swear by the Union to stand.

3. What heart does not beat with devotion,
At the sound of our Wash ington’s name?
Or thinks not with fervent emotion,
How dearly he bought us our fame?
O, ever his memory cherish,
And all its bright lustre revere;
May the traitor who sullies it perish,
For to us it is sacred and dear.
