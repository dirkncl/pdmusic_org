1. Friends have gone and left us pining, 
Far away from loved ones dear; 
In their tents they’re oft reclining, 
Dreaming of their battles near. 
Some bright faces we shall never, 
Never more on earth behold. 
But their mem’ry shall live ever, 
And their deeds shall yet be told.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, weep no more for brave boys gone, 
Shed not one tear in vain (in vain); 
For when this cruel war is done, 
Their homes, they’ll greet again (again).

2. Though dark clouds are hanging o’er us, 
And our fate is still unsealed, 
Though the tocsin’s sounds before us, 
And mad foes refuse to yield; 
Yet let all our fears be banished, 
Let no thought of anguish weep. 
For our brave boys who have vanished, 
And are sleeping their last sleep.

3. Night’s not always may distress us, 
Nor misfortunes fall our lot; 
Fearful hearts will soon caress us, 
Mourning homes will be forgot; 
All this turmoil and this wailing, 
Over land and over seas. 
May be changed to heart regaling, 
May be turned to joy and peace.
