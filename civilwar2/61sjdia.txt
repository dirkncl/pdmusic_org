1.
So Jeff Davis is a-coming!
(If he doesn't change his mind)
To make Massachusetts freemen,
Fly like chaff before the wind,
Whith his band of thieves and traitors!
With his Beauregard and Bragg!
With his horde of freedom haters,
They would tear down freedom's flag.

2.
Let him bring his armed legions,
We are ready for the fray,
The brave arm of Massachusetts
Yet shall make him rue the day.
Oft her sons have struck for freedom
Dealing death to every foe,
With her hero-chiefs to lead 'em.
Would she fail to conquer now?

3.
We have fields where sires fought bravely
Which stir our pride our spirits cheer
Bunkerhill's in Massachuchetts!
And old Concord too is there!
Come along and be in season
With the "gentry" of the south.
We would pay repsects to treason
In a speech from cannon's mouth!

4.
Brave old Massachusetts "Mudsills"
Ever will their rights defend.
They can grapple with a foeman
And if need be aid a friend.
Come along we will not falter,
But will show what we can do,
We can neatly noose a halter
And suspend a Traitor too!
