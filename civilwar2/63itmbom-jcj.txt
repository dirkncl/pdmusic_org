  A brave lad of sixteen years, belonging to a New England 
regiment, mortally wounded at Fredericksburg, and sent to 
the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, was ansiously 
looking for the coming of his mother. As his last hour 
approached and sight grew dim, he mistook a sympathetic 
lady who was wiping the cold, clammy perspiration from his 
forehand, for the expected one, and with a smile of joy 
lighting up his pale face, whishpered tenderly, "Is that 
mother?" "Then, " says the writer, "drawing her towards 
him with all his feeble strength, he nestled his head in 
her arms like a speeping infant, and thus died with the 
sweet word 'mother' on his quivering lips."

1. Is that mother? Is that mother bending o’er me,
As she sang my cradle hymn—
Kneeling there in tears before me?
Say! my sight is growing dim,
Comes she from the old home lowly,
Out among the northern hills,
To her pet boy dying slowly,
Of war’s battle wounds and ills.

2. Mother! Oh, we bravely battled,— 
  battled till the day was done;
While the leaden hail storm rattled— 
  Man to man and gun to gun.
  Man to man and gun to gun.

3. But we failed— and I am dying—
Dying in my boyhood’s years,
There— no weeping, self denying,
  Noble deaths demand no tears!
  Noble deaths demend no tears!
Fold your arms again around me;
Press again my aching head;
Sing the lullaby you sang me;
  Kiss me, mother, ere I’m dead!
  Kiss me, mother, ere I’m dead!
