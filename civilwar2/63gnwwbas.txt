NOTE.  The title of this song was taken from one the last
letters written by the gallant young Adj[utan]t. John 
Ed[ward]. Thompson of the 20th Ill[inois]. Reg[imen]t. who 
fell at the battle of Shiloh while bravely fighting for the
stars and the stripes.

1. Good night! dear brothers I will sleep
On Tennessee’s green shore,
Good night! sweet sisters do not weep
If I come home no more.

CHORUS 1-7.
Good night! who would not be a soldier,
When battle strife is near,
Good night! sweet sisters do not weep,
If I come home no more.

2. Who would not be a soldier brave,
When his dear country calls,
Tis sweet to fill a soldier’s grave,
For him who nobly falls.

3. If I should fall upon the field,
My Country’s flag to save,
I pray that its bright folds may shield
My lonely soldier grave.

4. I’m slain and life ebbs fast away,
I never more may see,
But oh! the stars and stripes they say
Still wave on Tennessee.

5. Brave boys farewell! go leave me now,
Your work is not yet done,
When twilight dews fall on my brow,
My spirit will be gone.

6. Dear home, farewell! I hopes to see
Thy hills and streams again,
But wild wood flow’rs will bloom o’er me,
When falls the summer rain.

7. Dear Country, best be lov’d, farewell!
May heaven’s smile be thine,
And all the stars we love so well,
On thy dear banner shine.
