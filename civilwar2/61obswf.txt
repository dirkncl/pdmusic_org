[Soprano]
1.
Up with the flag of the stripes and stars;
Gather together in strength let us come,
Hark to the signal! the music of wars
Sounding for tyrants and traitors their doom.
[REFRAIN]
March, march, falter never,
Brothers unite, rouse in your might,
For justice and freedom, for God and the right,
Our Banner shall wave forever.

2.
Down with the foe to the land and laws;
Marching together our country to save,
God shall be with us to strengthen our cause,
Serving the heart and the hand of the brave.
[REFRAIN]
March, march, falter never,
Brother unite, rouse in your might,
For justice and freedom, for God and the right,
Our Banner shall wave forever.

CHORUS [sung after 2nd and 4th verses (only)]
March, march, falter never;
Conquer or fall! rouse to the call,
For justice and freedom for one and for all;
Our Banner shall wave forever.

3.
Flag of the free under thee we will fight,
Shoulder to shoulder our face to the foe;
Death to all traitors and God for the right.
Lord raise the song as to battle we go.
[REFRAIN]
March, march, falter never,
Freemen unite, rouse in your might,
For justice and freedom and for God and the right,
Our Banner shal wave forever.

4.
Land of the free that our fathers of old
Bleeding together, cemented in blood,
Give us thy blessing as brave and as bold
Standing like one as united they stood.
[REFRAIN]
March, march, falter never,
Conquer or fall, rouse to the call,
For justice and freedom, for one and for all,
Our Banner shall wave forever.
