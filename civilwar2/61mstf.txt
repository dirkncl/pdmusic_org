1. Madmen! spare that flat.
Touch not one sacred fold.
Its worth is greater far,
Than all your mines of gold.
  By our fore fathers’ blood,
  Each star, and stripe, was bought?
  Then Madmen! let it hang,
  Thy hands, shall harm it not.
    Then Madmen! let it hang,
    Thy hands, shall harm it not.

2. That old familia flag,
Whose glory, and renown,
Are spread o’er land, and sea,
And wouldst thou tear it down?
  Madmen forbear the blow,
  Cut not a single tie;
  Who dares, to lay it low,
  In infamy shall die.
    Who dares, to lay it low,
    In infamy shall die.

3. Since the first dawn of life,
We’ve basked beneath its shade,
And all our hopes, and joys,
Around its staff have played.
  Our loved ones gathered there;
  The gentle, and the brave,
  With reverence, we swear,
  That old flag still shall wave.
    With reverence, we swear,
    That old flag still shall wave.

4. ’Round it our heart strings cling;
Stronger than love of life;
To shield it from all harm,
We welcome deadly strife.
  Old flag the wild storm brave;
  And Madmen leave the spot;
  While freedoms God can save,
  Thy hands, shall harm it not.
  While freedoms God can save,
  Thy hands, shall harm it not.
