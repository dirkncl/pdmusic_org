1. See the gallant Drummer Boy,
How his face lights up with joy,
As he takes his envied place
In the Corps of the “National Greys.”
  Noble Clarie,
  Patriot Clarie!
Drummer of the National Greys.

Strive with Clarie to complete,
As upon his drum he plays
In the Corps of the National Greys.

Where his own lifeblood may flow,—

In the Corps of the “National Greys.”

When he hears the shouts of praise
Echoing for the National Greys.

CHORUS 4
Noble Clarie,

Tho’ his eye betray’d a tear
When his Mother’s sadden’d gaze
Rested on the National Greys.

  Loving Clarie!
Drummer of the National Greys.

CHORUS 5

From its height our Country’s Flag!”

Pray’r and meekness guide his ways
In the Corps of the National Greys.

  Christian Clarie!

8. Hark! that musket’s direful sound!—
See the fatal ball rebound!
Suddenly a piercing cry
Rends the air and cleaves the sky;
  ’Tis from Clarie,
  Martyr Clarie!
Lov’d of all the National Greys.

CHORUS 8
’Tis from Clarie,
Martyr Clarie!
Lov’d of all the National Greys.

9. Tears those Soldiers’ eyes suffuse;
Sad and solemn is the news;
Clarie rudely from them torn,—
From their ranks forever gone.
  Mirthful Clarie,
  Buoyant Clarie!
Fav’rite with the National Greys.

CHORUS 9
Mirthful Clarie,
Buoyant Clarie!
Fav’rite with the National Greys.

10. Clarie now lies still and cold
(Only twelve brief summers old)
Low beneath the mould’ring sod,
But his soul had gone to God.
  Gentle Clarie,
  Youthful Clarie!
Mourn’d of all the National Greys.

CHORUS 10
Gentle Clarie,
Youthful Clarie!
Mourn’d of all the National Greys.

11. Muffled is the rolling drum,
Hush’d the busy childrens’ hum,
Agonized a father’s brow,—
All in deep submission bow.
  Spirit Clarie,
  Blessed Clarie!
Gather’d with the angels now.

CHORUS 11
Spirit Clarie,
Blessed Clarie!
Gather’d with the angels now.

12. Sadden’d is the humble home,
There no more his step will come,
But his songs of praise will rise
In a home beyond the skies.
  Happy Clarie,
  Ransom’d Clarie!
Seraph bright in Paradise.

CHORUS 12
Happy Clarie,
Ransom’d Clarie!
Seraph bright in Paradise.
