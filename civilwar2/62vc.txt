1. Viva Columbia! glorri ous and happy, 
proudly thy banner triumphant ever shall wave; 
Viva Columbia, land where our fathers died 
in the battles, our Country to save. 
Tyrants, traitors rule us no longer, 
freedom we hail thee as Heaven’s best gift. 

On heav’n depending, our rights defending, 
Great God of liberty lead our hosts to victory. 
Our foes must perish. freedom we cherish. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Viva Columbia the land of the free! 
Hail glorious Flag! Hail glorious Flag! 
Viva Columbia, land of the free!

2. Washington’s mem’ry sacred and cherished, 
fondly revered, in ev’ry patri ot’s breast. 
Father of freedom, thy spirit guides us! 
Flag of the Union, forever be bless’d! 
Thy sons bravely, dauntless in danger 
under thy banner will conquer or die. 

Union forever, no more to sever, 
We’ll shed our blood for thee to maintain 
our liberty. Union forever, no more to sever.
