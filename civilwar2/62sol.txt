1. Freedom is a theme of glory! 
Of battle and of victory, 
A Patriot’s fame and bleeding story, 
Bleeding with our Liberty; 
Its banner to the breese is stirring, 
And the years have rolled away, 
Still the folds are rich and swelling, 
Bright with stars of liberty.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Wake to the song of triumph ringing, 
Victoty! to victory! 
Banners floating, stars displaying; 
Patriot sons to glory waking, 
And declaring Liberty! 
Wake to the song of triumph ringing, 
Victory! Victory! 
Victory! Victoty!

2. When our Fathers, few in number, 
Sought from tyrants to be free, 
Hearts and hands were joined together, 
Dear as life was Liberty: 
God had heard their prayers ascending, 
Saw their faith and firm decree; 
And in wisdom’s power descending, 
Gave a glorious victory.

3. Freedom’s bird her wing is spreading,
Gallant still ’mid all dismay;
And our nation’s honors clenching
All her pride and Liberty!
Emulate our nation’s glory,
In sustaining Liberty!
Patriot names will live before us,
Clothed with immortality.
