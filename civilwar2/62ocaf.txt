1. Our flag and our country heav’ns blessings attend them; 
While we live we will cherish protect and defend them; 
While loyal and true hearts for freedom beat ever, 
No foeman or faction our country can sever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country forever, 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country and flag. 

CHORUS 1.
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our country for ever. 
Our country forever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our country and flag. 
Our country and flag. 

2. Our Union must stand throughout all future ages, 
Enshrin’d in our hearts and in history’s pages; 
As bought with the blood of our fathers, we cherish— 
And swear to preserve and maintain it, or perish. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our Union for ever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country and flag.

CHORUS 2.
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our Union forever. 
Our country forever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our country and flag. 
Our country and flag.

3. Our country is the land  of  the  patriot’s glory; 
The home of our Washington honor’d in story; 
The land of the friendless, the exile and stranger, 
The refuge of liberty and freedom from danger. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country forever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our counttry and flag.

CHORUS 3.
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our Country forever, 
Our country for ever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our country and flag. 
Our country and flag.

4. Oh! may then this Union be the home for all nations; 
For millions on millions thro’ all generations; 
And deeds of our fathers be ever made glorious, 
And our Star spangled banner be ever victorious. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country forever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Our country and flag.

CHORUS 4.
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our Union forever, 
Our Union forever. 
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! Hurra! 
Our country and flag. 
Our country and flag.
