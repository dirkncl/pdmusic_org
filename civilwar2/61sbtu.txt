1. Stand by the Union the glorious band
Joined by our patriot Sires!
Stand by our flag as our fathers did stand.
Kindling our freedom’s fires!
Die if we must firm in our trust,
’Neath the banner we love;
Stand by the stars and stripes All. 

CHORUS 1.
1. Floating the glorious Union above!
Stand by the stars and stripes!
Stand, stand by the stars and stripes!
Stand, stand by the stars and stripes!

2. Stand by the Union for traitors conspire
Boldly to break the band!
Stand by our flag thro’ the storm and the fire,
Bursting upon our land;
True to the death, may our last breath
Before the Union spent,
Stand by the stars and stripes All.

CHORUS 2. 
And not a star from our flag shall be rent,
Stand by the stars and stripes!
Stand, stand by the stars and stripes!
Stand, stand by the stars and stripes!
