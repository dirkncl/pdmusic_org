1. Far from the lonely gorges,
Where silent tents are spread,
Where moonlit nights look coldly,
On dying ones and dead.
Far from the scene of battle,
That meet us face to face;
A fairer vision greets me,
I find a welcome place.

CHORUS 1
Here back in dear New England,
And in my home once more;
Beside me is my dearest,
My darling Leonore.

2. I hear her joyous laughter,
Her footsteps as of yore,
I hear her blithe voice singing,
The olden songs once more.
I hear the prelude straying,
To echoes mid the trees;
I see her fingers playing
The old Piano Keys.

CHORUS 2
I joy in thee New England,
Here in my home once more;
For near me is my dearest,
My darling Leonore.

3. What is my idol singing?
My Country ’tis of thee,
Of our “Star Spangled Banner,”
The emblem of the free.
I must not stay to listen,
My Country calls to war;
So “good bye” to home and friends,
And my darling Leonore.

CHORUS 3
And I must leave New England,
My happy home once more;
And I must leave my dearest,
My darling Leonore.

4. Hark! hear the cannon booming,
The music of the drum;
The blood of Heroes calling,
Avenge them! Freemen! come!
Farewell to dear New England,
Farewell to home once more;
God guard and shield my country,
God bless my Leonore.

CHORUS 4
Farewell to dear New England,
Farewell to home once more;
God guard and shield my country!
God bless my Leonore.
