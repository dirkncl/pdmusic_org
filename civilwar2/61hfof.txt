Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Our flag, our flag is there,
  Yes our flag is there
  And we’ll hail it with three loud, three loud huzzas!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Our flag is there,
It shall wave gloriously;
  yes wave
O’er the land and the sea,
Our flag is there
It shall wave gloriously
  yes wave
O’er the land and the sea.
Stout hearts have fought for that bright flag,
Strong hands sustained it masthead high,
Stout hearts have fought for that bright flag,
Strong hands sustain’d it masthead high.

The stars and the stripes o’er the land shall wave
The stars and the stripes o’er the land shall wave,

And bring sweet joy to all the brave,
Yes, you to ev’ry patriots heart.

And bring sweet joy to all the brave, yes all the brave;
And oh, to see how proud it waves, how proud it waves.

Hurra! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Our flag, our flag, is there.
Hurrah! Hurrah!
