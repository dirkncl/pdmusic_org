1. The Lord by Moses to Pharaoh said: 
“O let my people go! 
If not, I’ll smite your firstborn dead, 
Then let my people go!” 

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
O! go down, Moses, 
Away down to Egypt’s land, 
And tell King Pharaoh, 
To let my people go!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
O! go down, Moses, 
Away down to Egypt’s land, 
And tell King Pharaoh, 
To let my people go!

2. No more shall they in bondage toll, 
O let my people go! 
Let them come out with Egypt’s spoil, 
O let my people go!

3. Haste, Moses, ’till the sea you’ve crossed, 
O let my people go! 
Pharaoh, shall in the deep be lost, 
O let my people go!

4. The sea before you shall divide, 
O let my people go! 
You’ll cross dryshod to the other side, 
O let my people go!

5. Fear not King Pharaoh or his host, 
O let my people go! 
They all shall in the sea be lost, 
O let my people go!

6. They’ll  sink like lead to rise no more, 
O let my people go! 
And you’ll hear a shout on the other shore, 
O let my people go!

7. The firey cloud shall lead the way 
O let my people go! 
A light by night, a shade by day, 
O let my people go!

8. Jordan shall stand up like a wall, 
O let my people go! 
And the walls of Jeri cho shall fall, 
O let my people go!

9. Your foes shall not before you stans, 
O let my people go! 
And you’ll posses fair Canaan’s land, 
O let my people go!

10. O let us all from bondage flee,. 
O let my people go! 
And let us all in Christ by free, 
O let my people go!

11. This world's a wilderness of woe, 
O let my people go! 
O let me all to glory go, 
O let my people go!
