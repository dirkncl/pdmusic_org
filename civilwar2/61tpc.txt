1.
On for freedom, on for glory
Tho' we breast huge billows gory
Worthy is the cause before us,
God of Nations reign thou o're us.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Patriots all, hark they call!
Patriots all, hark they call,
Hopeful rise from bended knee.
Trust the god of Liberty.
Trust the god of Liberty.
He will guide to victory.

2.
Tender youth and stalwart yoemen
Join the ranks against rising foemen.
Over hill and valley sounding
Freedom's shout shall ring resounding.

3.
Forth we march 'mid flowers vernal,
Grieving over wrongs fraternal;
Ere the autumn fruits are bending
May our songs of peace be blending.

4.
May our eagle spread his pinions
O'er the heads of traitrous minions,
And our starlit banner wave
Over dark rebellion's grave.

5.
Valiant men our hosts are leading,
Hands are firm though hearts are bleeding,
Struggle we for home and treasure,
Braving hardships without measure.

6.
Hearts and heads and lives now plighted,
For the strife we stand united,
Freely off'ring this oblation
So we save our glorious nation.
