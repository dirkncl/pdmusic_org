1. God save our country’s flag!
  Long may it wave,
In triumph o’er the free,
  The noble, brave,
The sign of liberty, 
  Our Father’s grave.

CHORUS 1-3.
God save our country’s flag,
Long may it wave.
The sign of liberty,
Our Father’s grave.

2. God save our country’s flag,
  No traitor hand
Shall hurl it from its place,
  No rebel band,
Shall trail it in disgrace
  O’er this fair land.

3. God save our country’s flag,
  With colors bright,
Still may it float afar
  In Heaven’s pure light
By every stripe and star,
  God speed the right.
