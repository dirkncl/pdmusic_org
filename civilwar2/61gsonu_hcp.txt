1. It came to us through darkies,
  It came to us through blood;
It shone out like the Promise 
  Of God upon the flood.
A beacon it has serv’d us 
  With true, unerring flame,
And cast a blaze of glory
  Upon our nation’s name:

[Refrain 1-6.]
God save our noble Union!
God save our noble Union!

2. ’Twas left us by our Fathers,
  Those souls of priceless worth—
The noblest types of manhood
  That ever walked the earth;
’Twas bought with fearful struggles,
  By sacrifice sublime.
And stands a proud mememto
  For all the coming time: 

3. Our land, a waste of native,
  Where beast and savage strayed;
Its wealth of lakes and rivers
  Unlocked by keys of trade;
Then, sunlike, rose the Union—
  A terror to our foes—
And lo! this “waste of nature”
  Now “blossoms as a rose:”

4. Where Earth lay hid for ages,
  In deep, primeval gloom,
Behold a boundless garden—
  A continent in bloom!
With iron bands of railroads,
  Electric tongues of fire,
And energies within us,
  Which time shall never tire:

5. But now upon our heaven
  Are signs of coming strorms;
And fierce, unholy passions
  Unfold their hideous forms;
The bravest hearts among us
  Are filled with doubt and fear,
While sounds of horrid discord
  Are grating on our ear—

6. The hallowed flag that bore us
  So proudly through the wars—
Is there a hand would sever
  Its sisterhood of stars?
Great God! can we go blindly
  Cast all Thy gifts away?
Or throbs there in this nation
  One heart that will not pray—
