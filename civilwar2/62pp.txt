"Pro Patria!" (1862)
A National Song
for
The Fourth of July, 
1862.
By Pilgrim John

_Dedication_
to
ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
President of the United States,
and
His Glorious Retinue
of triumphant
COMMANDING GENERALS,
with all true
NOBLE AND GALLAND COMPANIONS IN ARMS
for the Defence and Protection of
the Just Rights and Privileges
of a Great, Free, and Intelligent People,
and
the Best Government in the World:
This Humble Composition of Verse and Music
Is Repectfully Dedicated.

A P O L O G Y.
	The exceeding brevity and simplicity of these verses, as
well as of the music set to them, whereby they can be
so easily remembered, will perhaps be considered as no
disparagement, but rather a recommendation to the Public of
all ages, whose sentiments of increased patriotism and piety
have bee called forth by the present momentous crisis in
our national affairs.
	Should this trifling composition meet with any degree of
acceptance, and at the same time have the slightest tendency
in aid of the grand progress and final triumph of events,
if only to the extent of the widow’s mite — what greater
satisfaction could the author desire?

               P. J.

February 22, 1862.
