SOLO (or what is better, Chorus in unison]
1.
Hurrah! boys, hurrah! fling our banner to the breeze!
 Let the traitor and the rebel see its folds again unfurled:
And with the pirates that scorn upon the seas
 Our victorious Yankee banner-- sign of Freedom to the World!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We'll never have a new flag, for ours is the true flag,
The true flag, the true flag, the Red, White and Blue flag
Hurrah, boys, hurrah! we will carry to the wars
The old flag, the free flag, the Banner of the Stars.

2. [SOLO]
And what though its white shall be crimsoned with out blood!
 And what though its stripes shall be shredded in the storm!
To the worn flag, we'll keep our promise good,
 And we'll bear the starry blue field, with gallant hearts and arms.

3. [SOLO]
Then, cursed be he who would strike our Starry Flag!
 May the God of Hosts be with us, as we smite the traitor down!
And cursed be he who would hesitate or lag,
 Till the dear flag, the fair flag, with Victory we crown.
