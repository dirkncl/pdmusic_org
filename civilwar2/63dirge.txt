1. 
O! it is great for our Country to die, whose ranks are contending,
Bright is the wreath of our fame; glory awaits us for aye;
Glory, that never is dim, shining on with a light never ending,
Glory, that never shall fade, never O! never away!

2. 
O! it is sweet for our Country to die, how softly reposes
Warrior youth on his bier, wet by the tears of his love,
Wet by a mother’s warm tears; they crown him with garlands of roses,
Weep, and then joyously turn, bright where he triumphs above.

3. 
Not in Elysian fields, by the still oblivious river,
Not in the Isles of the blest, over the blue rolling sea;
But on Olympian heights shall dwell the devoted forever;
There shall assemble the good, there the wise, valiant, and free.

4. 
O! then how great for our Country to die, in the front rank to perish,
Firm with our breast to the foe, victory’s shout in our ear;
Long they our statues shall crown, in songs of memory cherish;
We shall look forth from our heaven, pleased the sweet music to hear.
