1. Backward still backward oh time in your flight 
Make me a child again just for tonight 
Mother come back from the Echoless shore 
Take me again to your heart as of yore 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care 
Smooth the few silver threads out of her hair 
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep 
Rock me to sleep mother Rock me to sleep.

 2. Over my heart in the days that are flown 
No love like mothers love ever has shone 
No other worship abides and endures 
Faithful unselfish and pa tient like yours 
None like a mother can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the worlds weary brain 
Slumber’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep 
Rock me to sleep mother Rock me to sleep.

 3. Mother dear mother the years have been long 
Since I las listen’d to you lul laby song 
Since then and unto my soul it shall seem 
Womanhood’s tears have been only a dream 
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep 
Rock me to sleep mother Rock me to sleep.
