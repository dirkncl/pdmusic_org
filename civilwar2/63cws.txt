1. Dey ring de bell, dey boom de gun,
  Dere ’joicing near and far,
Coz mighty things hab come to pass,
  Since Pompey went to war,
Dey could not whip de spunkey Sout’,
  Widout de darkey aid,
So gedder round ye brudders black
  And cheer de Black Brigade.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O Gineral Grant’s de man to day
  De country has in view,
He’s whipped de rebels eb’ry time
  And taken Vicksburg too.

2.  Pompey an’ Sam an’ all de boys
  Hab took dere sword and gun
An’ help’d de wite folks in de fight
  An’ made de rebels run.
Ole Affric’s sons hab won a name
  Like them will nebber fade.
So  gedder round ye brudders black
  An cheer de black brigade.

3. Oh! what a Linkon Abe will be
  When peace comes to dis land
An’ all de darkeys shout for joy
  An’ take him by de hand.
De best of homage ebberwhar
  To Abram should be paid
Becoz he let de darkies list
  An form de black brigade.

4. Now when dis ’bellion’s blotted out
  An’ we come home again
De wite folks ought to speak to us
  An’ call us colored men,
We’ve fought dere battles manfully
  De trouble’s in our shade,
So gedder round ye brudder blacks
  An’ cheer de black brigade.
