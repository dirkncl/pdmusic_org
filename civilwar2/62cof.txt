1. Champions of Freedom! onward march!
  March on to victory!
Shout the glad strain to Heaven’s high arch,
  Banished be slavery!
Shout the glad strain to Heaven’s high arch,
  Banished be slavery!
  Banished be slavery!

CHIRUS [sung after each VERSE]
HUZZA, HUZZA, HUZZA, HUZZA,
For right and Liberty!

2. No longer let our Nation’s curse,
  Here yoke the bond and free;
No longer let the oppressor’s purse
  Outweigh humanity,
No longer let the oppressor’s purse
  Outweigh humanity!
  Outweigh humanity!

3. Freemen! of every clime and land,
  Who from opression come,
Join heart to heart and land to land,
  Rescue your chosen home,
  Rescue your chosen home! 

4. Patriots! who boast of sires free born
  Deserving to be free
Gird on the armor they have worn,
  Like them fight manfully,
  Like them fight manfully!

5. Bear high unharmed Columbia’s dome,
  Each column unremoved;
Stand by your altars! Guard your home!
  By loyal deeds be proved;
  By loyal deeds be proved!

6. Battling for right! fight on, fight all!
  God shields us from all harms;
False shields or foes can ne’er appal
  Come the whole world in arms,
  Come the whole world in arms!

7. Your beacon fires! Ye glorious dead!
  Must here rekindled be;
We.ll win— or make our lands deathbed
  Our vast Thermopulae,
  Our vast Thermopulae!
