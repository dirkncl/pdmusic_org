1. Where shall we go unless to Thee;
Oh God of Light and Liberty,
In Thy loved name we humbly bow,
And crave Thy kind protection now.

CHORUS 1-2.
In Thy loved name we humbly bow,
And crave Thy kind protection now.

2. Unworthy of Thy aid we own
Our selves, and bend before Thy throne;
Aid us to fight in Freedom’s cause,
Uphold her rights maintain her laws.
