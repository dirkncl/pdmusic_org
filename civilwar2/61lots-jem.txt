1. Land of the South! the fairest land
  Beneath Columbia’s sky! 
Proudly fer hills of freedom stand,
  Her plains in beauty lie.
Her dotted fields, her traversed streams
  Their annual wealth renew.
Land of the South! in brightest dreams
  No dearer spot we view.

2. Men of the South! A free born race,
  They vouch a patriot line;
Ready the foeman’s van to fave,
  And guard their country’s shrine.
By sire and son a haloing light
  Through time is borne along;—
They “nothing ask but what is right
  And yield to nothing wrong.”

3. Fair of the South! rare beauty’s crown
  Ye wear with matchless grace;
No classic fair of old renown
  Deserve a higher place.
Your vessel robes alike become
  The palace and the cot;
Wives, mothers, daughters! ev’ry home
  Ye make a cherish’d spot.

4. Fair of the South! Aye, fling its folds
  Upon the kindred breeze;—
Emblem of dread to tyrant holds—
  Of freedom on the seas!
Forever may its stars and stripes
  In cloudless glory wave;
Red, white and blue, eternal types
  Of nations free and brave!

5. States of the South! the patriot’s boast!
  Here equal lays have sway—
Nor tyrant lord,, nor despot host,
  Upon the weak may prey
Then let them rule from sea to sea,
  And crown the queenly isle:—
Union of love and liberty,
  ’Neath heaven’s approving smile!

6. God of the South! protect this land
  From false and open foes!
Guided by Thine allruling hand
  In vain will hate oppose.
So mote the ship of state move on
  Upon the unfathomed sea;
Gallantly o’er the surges home
  The bulwark of the free!
