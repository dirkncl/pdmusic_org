  The foregoing stanzas are associated, in their original publication, with the
first uprising of the nation to resist the present rebellion. They were
suggested in connection with the raising of the flag of Fort Sumter, at
Union Square, New York, on the memorable 20th of April, 1861. The 
reference to the Flag of the country, as the "sign of liberty," bequeathed
by our fathers, is intended as a recognition of its original connection
with the avowal and promulagation of the national faith as set forth in the
Declaration of Independence.  In the preservation of the authority or
governmenbt which it represents, we may hope for the perpetual
recognition as well as the more perfect realization of the self-evident
principles in the annunciation of which the nation had its origin, and by
which it sougjht to be distinguished.

1. God save our Country’s flag!
  Long may it wave
In triumph o’er the free,
  The noble, brave,—
The sign of Liberty
  Our fathers gave!
The sign of Liberty
  Our fathers gave!

2. God save our Country’s flag!
  No traitor hand
May hurl if from its place;
  No rebel band
May trail in in disgrace
  O’er this fair land.—
The sign of Liberty
  Our fathers gave.

3. God save our Country’s flag!
  With colors bright
Still may it float afar
  In heaven’s pure light!
By every stripe and star,
  God speed the right!
By every stripe and star,
  God speed the right!
