1. Keep it before the people
That the earth was made for man
That the flow’rs were strown
And the fruits were grown
To bless and never to ban.
That sun and rain
And corn and grain
Are yours and mine, my brother,
Free sun and rain
And corn and grain
Are yours and mine, my brother,
Free gifts from heav’n and freely giv’n,
To one as well as another!

CHORUS 1-3.
Then up to the battle for truth and right
Till our banner o’er land and sea
Shall bathe its fold in the gloriious light
Of the year of jubilee.

2. Keep it before the people
That famine and crime and woe
Fore’er abide
Still side by side,
With luxury’s dazzling show;
That Lazarus crawls,
From Dives’ halls,
And starves at his gale, my brother,
Yet Lazaurus crawls,
From Dives’ halls,
And starves at his gate, my brother,
Yet life was giv’n by God from heav’n,
To one as well as another!

3. Keep it before the people
That the laborer claims his meed
The right of soil
And the right to tail,
From spur and bridle freed,
The right to bear
And the right to share
With you and me, my brother,
What ev’r is gov’n by God from heav’n,
To one as well as another!
