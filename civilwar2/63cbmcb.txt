1. Since Massa went to war de deuce has been to pay, 
De cotton-pickin’ darkies hab all run away; 
Some are up at Richmon’s, de good for noffin scamps, 
And some are digin’ muck in de Union Army camps.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den come back Massa, come back! 
O come back Massa, come back! 
Shake hands with Uncle Sam, and be a Union man 
And sabe de ole Plantation!

2. Ole Massa once was gay, and dress’d in satin fine, 
Now she’s awful poor, and wears no crinoline; 
De prog is mighty high, de mony awful scarce, 
And Lincoln’s got a mortgage on de niggers ob de place.

3. De possom and de ’coon, are sassy as you please
Since all de blooded dogs were toted off by fleas,—
De measles toted off all de cunin’ little nigs,
And de sojers ob de army had toted off de pigs! 

4. What de war is all about dis darkie doesn’t know,
But he thinks dat Mars’r Davis has a mighty slim show;
Down here in ole Virginy the Harry’s to pay,
Den come back Mars’r, or dis darkey’ll run away!
