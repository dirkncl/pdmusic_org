  In the Government hospital, on the day after the battle, lay 
a youthful member of the Ellsworth Zouave Corps, who, 
notwithstanding the frightful nature of his wounds, bore his 
sufferings with a patient heroism akin to inspiration.  For a 
long time he seemed unsconscious of the presence of his 
heart-broken mother, who watched by his couch fondly, yet in 
anguish of spirit, and lay like one in a trance.  At length, 
turning slowly over, on to have awakened themselves in his 
bosom, and, murmurming with the artlessness, of a child, "kiss 
me good night, mother," he fell back and was dead.


1. Mother, dear mother, the day has seem’d long
Since the lark warbled his matinal song:
Sadly the hours have pass’d, since fled the morn;
Darkly the moments that ne’er can return,
No beaming hopefulness, no joyous ray,
No cheerful sunshine to brighten my way.
But, mother, your kiss turns the darkness to light;
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night,
Thy tender love, mother, turns all to light::
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.

2. Mother, dear mother, I’m longing for rest,—
Longing to slumber for aye with the blest;
But when my sad spirit from earthlife is free,
Still shall thy presence seem nigh unto me.
Oft thy last kiss shall fall soft on my brow—
Sadly thine eyes gaze upon me as now;
And often I’ll say with the angels in white,
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night:
Thy tender love, mother, makes all so bright:
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.
