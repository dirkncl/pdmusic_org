1. Kiss me. mother, ere I die,— 
Let me feel thy soft caressing, 
Ere I in the cold grave lie, 
Give me once again thy blessing, 
As you blest me when a boy— 
When of life’s bliss I was dreaming— 
Years have wrecked those ships of joy 
And no star of hope is beaming.

(Refrain) [sung after each verse]
Oh! Kiss me, mother, ere I die— 
Let me feel thy soft caressing; 
Ere I in the cold grave lie;
Kiss me, mother, ere I die.

CHORUS [sung after each Refrain)
Kiss our, mother, ere I die, 
Once again your child caress, 
Soothe, oh! soothe my dying hours, dear mother— 
Kiss me, kiss me ere I die.

2. Kiss me. mother, ere I sleep, 
Never more on earth awaking;— 
Nay, I would not leave thee weep,— 
As my soul its flight is taking. 
Do not weep for me who goes 
From a world of care and sorrow, 
To a sweet and fast repose 
Where there comes no fading morrow. 

3. Kiss me. mother, ere I die,— 
Sweeter far will be our meeting 
Past the pearly clouds that lie 
Where the sun the morn is greeting, 
Then, upon my pallid brow, 
Press thy loving lips with gladness, 
Death is painless to me now 
Thy sweet kiss hath banished sadness.
