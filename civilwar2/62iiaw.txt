1. Sister Norf and Sister Souff, 
Gut a pooty figger, 
Fightin’ like two Thomascats 
All about the Nigger; 
Nigger here, Nigger dar, 
Nigger eber yonder; 
Set ’em up, knock ’em down, 
Oh! isn’t it a wonder? 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Yah! yah! yah! cady-cadunk, 
Isn’t is a wonder? 
Yah! yah! yah! yah! yah! yah! yah! 
Oh! isn’t it a wonder?

2. Johnny Bull and Leny Nap,
Standin’ by to watch ’em,
When dey break dar teef and clays,
Den dey hope to catch ’em,
Darkey don’t know what to do—
Tinks de ling a blunder—
Wishes dey would stop de muss—
Oh! isn’t is a wonder? 

3. De woodchook trabbles froo de wood
As free as any ranger; 
De cunnin’ possum suns herself 
Widout a tought of danger. 
De wild goose sails upon de stream 
Widout a dislu’ under; 
De Nigger cannot shoot ’em now,
Oh! isn’t it a  wonder? 

4. De Nigger is a jolly bird, 
You cannot do without him;
So quit de war and make it up, 
And say no more about him. 
You might as well attempt to stop 
De lightnin’ and de thunder, 
As try to kill de colored race—
Oh! isn’t it a wonder?
