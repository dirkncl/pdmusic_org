1. The Stars and Stripes are waving o’er
Old Sumter’s walls again,
And ringing shout, of victory
Salute the land and main!
Hurrah! the traitors, emblem falls,
That flag of infamy!
And Sumter’s proud and treach’rous walls
Are grumbling in the sea!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
The Stars and Stripes are waving o’er
Old Sumter’s walls again!
And ringing shouts of victory
Salute the land and main!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
The Stars and Stripes are waving o’er
Old Sumter’s walls again!
And ringing shouts of victory
Salute the land and main.

2. The fortress whose strong battlements
Defied as in their might,
Now falters at the approach of those
Whose hearts are in the right.
So, may it be until their base
And false, inglorious course
Has ended and their hearts are with
The Union and the Laws. 

3.  Sumter is ours! our flag, once more
Upon the ramparts wave!
And ’neath her ruined, shattered wall,
Are many a traitor’s grave.
Wave on! old flag! as in the past
Thy glitt’ring folds we see;
Wave forth in all thy glories bright,
Sweet emblem of the free!
