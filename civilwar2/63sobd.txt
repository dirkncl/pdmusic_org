A Mothers's Cradle Song
(La Ninnarella)
Italian words by J. Debrin
English words by H.C. Watson
Music by Louis Moreau Gottschalk

Slumber on, Baby dear, 
Do not hear thy mother's sigh, 
Breath'd for him far away, 
Whilst she sings thy lullaby! 
Slumber on Baby, dear, 
Do not hear thy mother's sigh,
Breath'd for him far away,
Whilst she sings thy lullaby!

Slumber on, o're thy sleep, 
Loving eyes will watch with care, 
In thy dreams, may though see 
God's own angels hov'ring here; 
Slumber on, may sweet sleep 
Softly on thy eyelids lie, 
While I watch, chaunting low, 
Thy sweet soothing lullaby, 

Slumber on, happy child, 
May life's storms pass gentle by, 
When this voice, hush'd and still, 
No more sings thy lullaby! 
Slumber on, happy child,
May life's storms pass gentle by,
When this voice, hush'd and still,
No more sings thy lullaby!

In this heart, torn with grief, 
Lies a danting love for thee, 
Father come, bless my child, 
Sweetly slumb'ring on my knee; 
Slumber on, may sweet sleep 
Softly on thy eyelids lie, 
While I watch chaunting low, 
Thy sweet soothing lullaby. 
Slumber on, may sweet sleep
Softly on thy eyelids lie,
While I watch chaunting low,
Thy sweet soothing lullaby.

Oh, sleep, oh, sleep my child, oh sleep!
