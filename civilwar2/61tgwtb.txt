[NOTE: A Balmoral is a striped heavey woolen petticoat,
a brimless Scottish cap, or a laced walking shoe. 
The word comes from Balmoral Castle in SW Aberdeenshire, 
Scotland (built by Queen Victoria in 1854.]

[Verse]
As I was walking down the street, 
I met my charming Kate; 
I ax’d where she was goin’ to, 
She says I’m goin to skate; 
I walked along close by her side, 
And didn’t we cut a swell 
With high heel’d boots upon her feet, 
She wore a Balmoral.

CHORUS [sung twice]
O, there’s fun upon the ice, 
And lots of nice young gals, 
My goodness how they glide along, 
Dressed in their Balmorals.
