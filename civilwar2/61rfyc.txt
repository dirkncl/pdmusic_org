1. 
Rise for your Country, ye sons of the free,
Rise for the Union, for sweet Liberty.
Rise for your homes, for your children, for all,
Rise and march on, for justice doth call.
Fear not what foes or e’en traiters may boast,
A few when in justice can conquer an host,
But justice and might both favor us now,
Let justice prevail, though the heavens should bow!

2. 
Hang up your sickles awhile on the wall,
’Tis better your crops than country should fall,
Ye who by traffic add wealth to the land,
Join in the strife that the Union may stand;
All rally round it, ’tis God bids you come,
Quick blow up the shrill fife, and strike the deep drum,
March forward to conquer, God shields the brave,
Or die like true freemen, your Country to save!

3. 
Let this be our glory, this be our pride,
Host of true freemen for Liberty died,
We love that Freedom; if traitors assail,
Vengence will meet them and treason shall fail;
Our arms are still strong, our soldiers still brave,
The warhorse is neighing, our banner doth wave,
Those Stars and those Stripes, dishonored, disowned,
Shall still wave in triumph, when peace sits enthroned!
