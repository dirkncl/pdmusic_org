1. All hail to the day when our fathers arose,
The rod and the sceptre of tyranny scorning,
And proudly defying the might of their foes,
Proclaim’d to the nation that Freedom was dawning!
When they sternly awoke to their wrongs, and the yoke
Of the haughty oppressor indignantly broke.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let the long shout roll on, till the sound dies away
O’er the far distant mountains, ALL HAIL TO THE DAY!
Let the long shout roll on, till the sound dies away
O’er the far distant mountains, ALL HAIL TO THE DAY!

2. O long may we cherish the deeds and the fame,
Of the sires who their all for our liberty plighted,
And in our young hearts may the patriot flame,
Which burn’d in their bosoms so purely be lighted.
And still green be the thought of the lessons they taught,
When ’mid toils and ’mid dangers our freedom they bought.

3. The time will soon come when, in silence and dust,
Our father’s strong arms will together be blended;
To whom, then, but us, can they yield up their trust?
By whose arms, but our own will the prize be defended?
Then still bright be the fires that were lit by our sires,
Upon freedom’s high altar till nature expires!

4. We will move on our way undismay’d by the world,
And pray that the smile of the Lord may attend us:
For the Just and the True if our flag be unfurl’d,
His right hand the Great God of Battles will lend us.
Let our hearts then be steel’d and our arms never yield,
And the Lord God of Hosts be our sword and our shield:
