1.
The moon rose o'er the battle plain,
And smiled from her dark thone,
Upon the wounded and the slain
Left bleeding there alone,
A maiden sought that place of death,
And gazing round the scene,
She caught a faintly passing breath,
And knelt upon the green,
Oh! Mary dear, why art thou here?
Cried one she hended o'er.
Our friends have fled,
Our freedom's dead,
It is our home no more!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then Mary deareat Mary fly 
And leave, oh! leave me to die.

2.
What still upon the gory ground,
This bleak and fearful night,
Fiends hold their revelries around
Too horrid for your sight,
Oh! if thou pray'st, pray not for me,
But for each breathing slave;
'Twere better far not being free,
To perish with the brave,
Oh! Mary dear, forgive this tear!
Not for myself 'tis shed.
With thee alone I could live on,
Though all the world were dead.
