This Requiem was written at the time of the passing of the funeral procession
of Capt. Nathl. B. Shurtleff Jr. who fell in Battle, at Cedar Mountain, Va. August
9th, 1862.  The music by a lad of thirteen years was composed
for and sung at the late Exhibition of the Public Latin School, Boston,
in commenoration of the past and present members of the school,
who fighting with heroic valor, had given up their lives as martyrs
in defence of Freedom, and of their country's nationality.

1. Breathe, trumpets breathe
Slow notes of saddest wailing
Sadly responsive peal,
Ye muf’fled drums;
Comrades with downcast eye,
And muskets trailing,
Attend him home,
Attend him home,
The youthful warrior comes.

2. Upon his shield,
Upon his shield returning,
Borne from the field of honor
Where he fell
Glory and Grief together clasped in mourning
His fame, his fate,
His fame, his fate,
With sobs exulting tell.

3. Wrap ’round his breast
The flag his breast defeaded
His country’s flag,
In battle’s front unrolled
For it he died; the earth foreever ended,
His brave young life,
His brave young life
Lives in each sacred fold.

4. With proud fond tears,
By flags of shame untainted,
Bear him and lay him
Gently to his game;
Above the hero write,
The young, halfsainted,
His country called,
His country called,
His life hee freely gave.
