1. I’m coming home, my mother, dear,
From the battle, strong and true,
I’ve braved the storm of iron hail,
That so thick around me flew,
While comrades fell on every side,
And friend and foe thick strewed the plain,
Untouched in peace I once more seek
My own loved home again.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Home, home, coming, coming home,
Joyous and happy be the day,
When by thy side I stand dear mother,
Unharmed by thy battle fray.

2. When in the fight the foe pressed hard,
Thy words have been my stay,
And on my lonely beat at night,
I knew for me you’d pray,
And when the long and weary march,
And hunger made me weak and low,
The thought of you, my mother, dear,
Gave strength to meet the foe.

3. But now the time for me has come,
And with a leaping heart,
From scenes of strife and bitter pain
I soon shall gladly part,
Sweet scenes of peace shall greet my view,
From which I hope no more to roam,
And mother, friend, and kindred dear,
Shall give me welcome home.
