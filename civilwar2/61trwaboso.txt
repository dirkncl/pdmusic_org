1.
May God bless our flag and our land,
United in strength and for freedom we stand.
The chains of oppression are broken in two.
All hail to our Colors The Red, White and Blue.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The chains of oppression are broken in two.
All hail to our Colors, the Red, White and Blue.

2.
From North unto South, from the East to the West,
  Floats proudly our Banner, o'er the land of the blest.
Upheld by our brothers so gallant and true,
  All hail to our Colors, the Red, White and Blue.

3.
The blood shed for Freedom by our Sires in the wars
  Has crowned high with glory the Stripes and the Stars
Though barefoot and hungry, they fought their way through,
  For the praise and the honor of the Red, White and Blue.

4.
Great nation of Freedom, Great Land of the Brave,
  Unfurl now thy Banner, for e'er may it wave,
As a sign to all nations, as an emblem to you,
  That no foe is too mighty, for the Red, White and Blue.
