1. Columbia we love thee, and justly are proud
Of each deed of valor thy history tells
While heroes and sages proclaim thee aloud
The nation alone wherin Liberty dwells.
The dead of the despot thy name still shall be
And thy banner forever float o’er the free.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Columbia, thy flag shall for aye be unfurl’d
The standard of Freedom, and Hope of the World.

2. If e’er in defiance of justice and right
To plot thy destruction for foe should combine
Thy freemen Columbia will rise in their might
To die or defend thee fair Liberty’s shrine;
And in peace or in war their watchword shall be
May thy banner forever float o’er the free.

3. United and firm may thy children be found
Thy free institution and laws to maintain
While throughout the world may thy pure fame resound
Respected alike o’er the land and the main;
Thy sails swelling proudly shall whiten the sea
And thy banner forever float o’er the free.
