1. After the battle’s over and the reign of strife hath ceased,
When friends and foes together lie around in death’s embrace;
Calling to a fallen brother, “water! water! quick!” he cries;
And that well known word “MOTHER,” speaks he faintly e’er he dies.
Peace to thy soul, young soldier,
She will meet thee in the skies.

2. Off in a thatch’d roof cottage, reading by the open door;
Sat one with careworn visage, scanningwell the papers o’er:
’Mong the list of killed and wounded, there she reads the name of him;
Who has in old age guarded her and from those lips so thin
One fervent, soft prayer sounded
For his soul a fond requiem.

3. Died! on the field of battle, far from home and cherish’d friends,
There where deathmissles rattle, died, his country to defend,
Let us ne’er forget the soldier,— Brothers! Heroes! ev’ry one;
And whilst those brave souls moulder; buried on some plain aalone;
Put to the wheel our shoulder,
And drive Treason from our land.
