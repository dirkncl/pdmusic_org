1. The union train at last is here,
Now jump aboard brave volunteer,
We’re going south as fast as we can,
Come on and prove that you’re man.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Clear the track! Clear the track rebel legion!
Clear the track! Clear the track! to your region,
The union train a host is bringing,
Don’t you hear the bells a ringing?
Clear the track! Clear the track! to your region!

2. Way down in Tennessee, they say
The rebek ruffians have their way,
But soon their savage work we’ll stop,
We’ll make their heads swim like a top.

3. We’ve got a double track all laid,
M’Clellan planned the rout and grade,
The rebels now confess their fears,
They tho’t we’d got no engineers.

4. They’ve put torpedies on the track,
Of other plans they have no luck,
But though they make some heroes fall,
We’ll save the Union, spite of all.
