1. You ask what makes this darkie weep. 
Why, he like others am not gay; 
What makes the tear flow down his cheek, 
From early morn ’till close of day. 
My story, darkies, you shall hear, 
For in my mem’ry fresh it dwells. 
’Twill cause you all to drop a tear, 
On the grave of my sweet Kittie Wells.

CHORUS [sung after each verse] 
While the birds were singing in the morning 
And the myrtle and the Ivy were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a dawning, 
It was then we laid her in the tomb.

2. I never shall forget the day, 
That we together roam’d the dells; 
I kiss’d her cheek and nam’d the day 
That I should marry Kittie Wells, 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy, my pride, 
And when I found she was no more, 
Then I laid my banjo down and cried.

3. I often wish that I was dead, 
And laid beside her in the tomb, 
The sorrow that bows down my head, 
Is silent in the midnight gloom, 
The springtime has no charms for me. 
Though flow’rs are blooming in the dells, 
For that bright form I do see, 
’Tis the form of my sweet Kittie Wells.
