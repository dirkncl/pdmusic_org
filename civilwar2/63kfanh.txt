1. Sleep noble hero, 
Let not one fear, 
Steal o’er the brave heart, 
As death draws near, 
For in her sorrow, 
Mother will find, 
True hearts around her, 
Loving and kind, 
Though you have left her, 
Weeping for you, 
Kind friends are near her, 
Constant and true 
They’ll surely cheer her 
When you are gone, 
They will not see her 
Mourning alone.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Friends will be near her, 
Angels will come, 
To guard and cheer her, 
When you are gone.

2. Angels will  guard her, 
By night and day, 
Gently they’ll lead her, 
Up through the way, 
Though friends forsake her, 
They will be there. 
Ready to save her, 
From dark despair, 
Should angels leave her, 
Still there is ONE 
Who will receive her, 
When all are gone, 
One who will guide her 
Safe to that home, 
Where no more sorrow 
Ever can come.
