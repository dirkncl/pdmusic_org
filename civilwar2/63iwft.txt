1. I am list’ning for your footsteps
Falling quick and light
I am looking for your sweet smile
Beaming pure and bright
From the distant field of battle
You will come to me
For the war is nearly over
And I wait for thee.

CHORUS 1-3.
Waiting, waiting where the clover blooms beneath the tree
For the war is nearly over and I wait for thee.

2. I am waiting where we parted
On that summer day,
Where the morning sunbeams linger
And the zephyrs play;
Where you told me you were going
At your country’s cry:
Now the war is nearly over
You’ll come bye and bye.

3. I have got the sing you gave me
When you left my side,
When I promised, you remember,
To become your bride
I have prayed that God would bless you,
Bring you back to me
Now the war is nearly over
And I wait for thee.
