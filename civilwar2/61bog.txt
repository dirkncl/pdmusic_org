Oh, we aint, going home any more,
Oh, we aint, going home any more,
Oh, we aint, going home any more,
Down't the peach blow farm.
Balm of Gilead,
Balm of Gilead,
Balm of Gilead,
Down't the peach blow farm.

Massa loved his good old jamaica,
his good old jamaica, his good old jamaica,
Massa loved his good old jamaica,
Down in Alabama.

CHORUS [B]
Hip! hip! hurrah!
Ah, ah,
Hip! hip! hurrah!
Oh, my lamb.

Ain't I glad to get out the wilderness,
get out the wilderness, get out the wilderness,
Ain't I glad to get out the wilderness,
Oh my lamb.

My old horse he came from Jerusalem,
he came from Jerusalem, he came from Jerusalem,
He kicked so high they put him in the museum,
Down in Alabama.
