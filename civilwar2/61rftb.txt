1. Banded now together in the morn of life,
Stand we firm together for the day of strife—
Ready to encounter musket ball or knife,
Should we be order’d on!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Rally! rally to the banner!
Swear to fight for the banner!
Loud we shout for our BANNER—
Cheers for the stripes and stars!

2. Help to crush rebellion, and cover it with shame—
Emulate in gladness our father’s deeds of fame;
So we’ll bravely strive to win a Patriot’s name,
Should we be ordered on!

3. We shall endeavor to heed our Country’s call—
Pledg’d dare we for life, for honor and for all,
By the RIGHT to stand, or the RIGHT to fall,
If we are ordered on!
