1. A bold brave crew and an ocean blue, 
And a ship that loves the blast; 
With a good wind piping merrily 
In the tall and gallant mast. 

CHORUS 1
Ha! ha, my boys, 
These are the joys 
Of the noble and the brave; 
Who love a life In the temp est’s strife, 
And a home on the mountain wave.

2. When the driving rain of the hurricane 
Puts  the light of the lighthouse out, 
And the growing thunder sounds its gong 
On the whirlwind’s battle rout. 

CHORUS 2
Ha! ha! do you think 
That the vallent shriek? 
No! no! we are bold and brave. 
And we love to fight 
In the wild midnight, 
With the storm on the mountain wave.

3. Breezes that die where the greenwoods sigh,
To the landsman sweet may be,
But give to the brave the broad back wave,
And the tempest’s midnight glee!

CHORUS 3
Ha! ha! the blast,
And the rocking mast,
And the seawind brisk and cold,
And the thunder’s jar,
On the seas ajar,
Are the things that suit the bold. 

4. The timbers creak, the seabirds shriek;
There’s lightning in yon blast!
Hard to the leeward! mariners,
For the storm is gathering fast!

CHORUS 4
Ha! ha! to night,
Boys, we must fight;
But the winds which o’er us yell
Shall never scare
The mariner
In his winged citadel!
