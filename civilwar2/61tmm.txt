1. The flag of the South proudly waves in the breeze
And the minute men’s cheers, with ardor resound;
Their rifles in haste, round that standard they seize,
Thro’ the land of their birth, their cries now rebound.
Haste, haste! with your might
Sustain all your right!
Your legions but slowly appear;
Whilst foemen delay,
Bold Fame leads the way,
Brave sons of the South, draw near!
[REFRAIN]
Whilst foemen delay,
Bold Fame leads the way,
Brave sons of the South draw near!

2. With CALHOUN for model and YANCEY for guide
PALMETTO’S brave cohorts are first in the field,
Her forefather’s manes call her sons side by side,
To fight in her ranks under Liberty’s shield.
Arise, and stand forth!
The strength of the North,
On your soil now dreads to appear;
The trumpet’s shrill sound,
All hearts makes rebound,
Brave sons of the South, draw near!
[REFRAIN]
The trumpet’s shrill sound,
All hearts makes rebound,
Brave sons of the South draw near!

3. But where is that phantom your ancestors nursed?
The Union!— base Seward has settled its doom,
That demon of discord, for ever accursed!
Its fate has consigned to a merciless tomb.
Hoist in ev’ry glade,
The trueblue cockade,
The minute men’s emblem hold dear;
Then seek no delay,
Hold traitors at bay,
Brave sons of the South draw near!
[REFRAIN]
Then seek no delay,
Hold traitors at bay,
Brave sons of the South draw near!

4. Where your pastures are radiant with Heav’n’s best light
Monopoly moves through the land of the free,
Like a spectre that stalks in the stillness of night,
Its victims alluring with vile sophistry.
Then crush its dark shade,
And cheer for free trade,
With your rallying cry appear;
For misfortunes past
Nail your flag to th’ mast,
Brave sons of the South draw near!
[REFRAIN]
For misfortunes past
Nail your flag to th’ mast,
Brave sons of the South draw near!

5. O’er Fort Moultrie now floats that Banner unfurled,
Hurrah for Palmetto!— success to her right!
With hope in the future, she shows to the world,
Her legions assembling all around for the fight.
For bigots’ alarms
The minute men’s arms,
Respond to the Union fear;
’Gainst the Northern blast,
The scabbard is cast,
Brave sons of the South draw near!
[REFRAIN]
’Gainst the Northern blast,
The scabbard is cast,
Brave sons of the South draw near!
