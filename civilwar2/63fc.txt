1.
The life we live, we live for thee,
Columbia, fair Columbia!
No land so happy, fair and free,
As happy fair Columbia.
Brave souls are battling for the right;
Brave hearts are rushing to the fight;
The Nation risies in its might,
For happy fair Columbia! 

CHORUS 1
Brave souls are battling for the right,
Brave hearts are rushing to the fight,
The Nation rises in its might
For happy fair Columbia!

2.
Weep for the gallant, valiant men,
Who die for fair Columbia!
They shall arise to life again,
Above our fair Columbia.
Ah! yes, to life immortal, rise,
And form an army in the skies,
To guard the freedom, freemen prize,
And shield our fair Columbia!

CHORUS 2
Ah! yes to life immortal rise,
And form an army in the skies
To guard the freedom, freemen prize,
And shield our fair Columbia! 

3.
Hark! to a patriot’s last appeal,
Columbia, fair Columbia!
My Mother Land, to thee I kneel,
In prayer for Columbia.
Thy glorious Chivalry shall rise,
With dauntless hearts, and eagle eyes,
And wave victorios to the skies
Thy banner, fair Columbia!

CHORUS 3
Thy glorious Chivalry shall rise,
With dauntless hearts, and eagle eyes,
And wave victorious to the skies
Thy banner fair Columbia! 

4.
Oh God! shall mortal man control,
In happy, fair Columbia!
The life of one immortal soul,
In happy, free Columbia.
No! better that the traitor knaves
Were heaped by thousands in their graves,
Who boast they’d make all free men slaves,
In happy fair Columbia!

CHORUS 4
No! better that the traitor knaves
Were heaped by thousands in their graves,
Who boast they’d make all freemen slaves,
In happy, fair Columbia! 

5.
No! high above, in clouds of light,
Above our fair Columbia!
Sits God the Arbiter of fight,
The shielf of fair Columbia.
There hosts on hosts of Angels bright,
Are battling with us for the right:
God’s arm the rebel horde shall smite,
And free our fair Columbia!

CHORUS 5
There hosts on hosts of Angels bright,
Are battling with us for the right:
God’s arm the rebel horde shall smite,
And free our fair Columbia!
