1. Ye Sons of Rhode Island, the silver wing’d shuttle 
Has paus’d in its flight by Pantucket’s blue stream, 
The white threads are broken, the stream thunder silent 
And palsied the arm, of the loom’s giant beam. 
The cataract of fire that clash’d from the furnace, 
When labor was Godlike and workmen were lords, 
Now luridly flashes, where Freemen are forging 
Their sickles to spears and their ploughshares to swords.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah for Rhode Island! 
Her vallies and highlands, 
Her blue Naragansett that kisses the shore; 
Raise up with Hosannah our Star Spangled Banner, 
One Union, one Country, one God evermore! 
One Union, one Country, one God evermore!

2. A shout has gone up, tis the year of a nation 
Awaking from slumber arising from sleep, 
The Southrons have sons the rank tares of rebellion, 
And sad is the harvest the Northmen will reap; 
For God, and your Country! your wives and your daughters, 
For Freedom and Honer, for Justice and Right! 
Ye men of Rhode Island! ye sons of the Pilgrims! 
There floats your old banner, March on to the fight!

3. Our anchor is fix’d with its “Hope” blazon’d motto, 
It holds our mav’rick ship through 
Discision’s black Mast. 
Oh! proud little Rhody! there’s Hope in the future, 
And victory radiant with honor at last; 
If you fall on the field, 
There’s a Heaven above you, 
Though patriot’s blood may empurple the sod. 
The red flash of war is a fiery Chariot, 
To bear the dead Hero in Glory to God.
