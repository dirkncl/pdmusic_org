1.
Oh! we're a band of brothers,
Arrayed at freedom's call;
We're fighting for man's dearest rights,
Which God designed for all.
Our watchword is "THE UNION":
We mean it shall be just;
We hail the Goddess Liberty,
And place it in her trust.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Freedom's Flag hurrah!
The red, the white, the heavenly blue,
Where shines the Northern Star!

2.
The haughty Southern Traitors,
Must fall before our might;
Their hearts are hot, their arms are strong,
But we are in the right.
We wish them nothing evil;
Our welfare is their gain;
But for our country and our God,
We must break ev'ry chain!
