1. The boldest and the bloodiest raid 
The Southern Legions ever made, 
Was when their countless thousands strayed 
To Gettysburg! To Gettysburg! 
Laden with spoils upon each back, 
A wolflike and ferocious pack, 
How few e’er found the homeward track 
From Gettysburg! From Gettysburg! 
How few e’er found the homeward track 
From Gettysburg! From Gettysburg!

2. Exultant with their bold career,
And flushed and gay with goodly cheer,
They rushed, with little thought of fear
To Gettysburg! To Gettysburg!
But there they met upon the path
The lion North inflamed with wrath,
And roused for Liberty or Death—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
And roused for Liberty or Death—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!

3. On! as a mighty throng they came;
On! like a hurricane of flame,
To conquer— or to fly in shame
From Gettysburg! From Gettysburg!
Horsemen and foot of all degrees,
Of Southern hives and haunts the lees,
They came, our Northern homes to seise,
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
They came, our Northern homes to seise,
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!

4. Fearful and bloody was the shock—
A whirlwind battling ’gainst a rock,
And human life an empty mock
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
Thousands on thousands fought and fell,
And many a wild and fearful yell
Rose o’er that fratricidal hell,
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
Rose o’er that fratricidal hell,
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!

5. Yes ’twas a fierce and bloody fray,
A glorious yet a gory day—
The ded in dread sonfusion lay—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
On— like an avalanche they came!
The low in birth— the high in fame,
The champions of a cause of shame—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
The champions of a cause of shame—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!

6. But when the fearful strife was o’er
And night and silence reigned once more
UP WENT THE OLD FLAG AS OF YORE,
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
And while it streams upon the air
Oh! let no human heart despair,
For God was surely with us there—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
For God was surely with us there—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!

7. And Waterloo itself shall fade,
Before the nobler, mightier deed,
The victory achieved by Meade—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
The lion conquered in his lair,
The Braggart flying in despair
God help the souls that perished there—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
God help the souls that perished there—
At Gettysburg! At Gettysburg!
