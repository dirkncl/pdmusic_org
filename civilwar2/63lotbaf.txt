1. Oh gaily shone the beams of morning,
  Ush’ring in fair Freedom’s light;
When storms and billows bravely scorning,,
  Come to these shores that band so bright.
Who from old Europe’s climes all daring,
  Cross’d o’er the wintry sea.
Here in this westerm world preparing,
  The land of the Brave and Free.

CHORUS 1.
Land of the Brave and Free.
Land of the Brave and Free.
We give our hearts, our hearts to thee.
Land of the Brave and Free.

2. But hark! what music gently stealing,
  Brings to the ear a joyous sound?
A grand old bell sends forth its pealing,
  Telling to all the world around,—
Signed is glorious declaration
  Of blessed liberty,,
That made for aye our happy nation
  The Land of the Brave and Free.

CHORUS 2.
Land of the Brave and Free.
Land of the Brave and Free.
We give our hopes, our hopes to thee.
Land of the Brave and Free.

3. From that glad our to this progressing,
  Here is the blessfull home of all,
Who flee from tyrants grim oppressing,
  And would escape their hatred thrall.
Here acres tilling, forests felling,
  With art and industry;—
This our charmed word, all gloom dispelling,
  The Land of the Brave and Free.

CHORUS 3.
Land of the Brave and Free.
Land of the Brave and Free.
We give our all, our all to thee.
Land of the Brave and Free.

4. Let war then burst upon our border,
  Let foemen come our hopes to slay;
We rise, and soon in wild disorder,
  Hurl them in bloody rout away.
From mountain glen and lowly valley
  Our hurrying legions see,
Thee to defend, they proudly rally
  The Land of the Brave and Free.

CHORUS 4.
Land of the Brave and Free.
Land of the Brave and Free.
We give our lives, our lives to thee.
Land of the Brave and Free.

5. Oh thou Great Being who presideth
  Over the destinies of all,
While time and nature’s course abideth
  Spare, spare our Union still from fall!
Our rights, our Constitution guarding,
  Ecen our best friend be,
The gracious guidance are affording,
  The Land of the Brave and Free.

CHORUS 5.
Land of the Brave and Free.
Land of the Brave and Free.
We give our prayers, our prayers to thee.
Land of the Brave and Free.
