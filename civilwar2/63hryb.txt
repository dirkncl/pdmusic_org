1. Ho! up to the conflict
Ye gallant and brave!
Fling out the best banner
Our fore father’s gave!
With the lay of the loyal, the shout of the true,
Come, rally around our old Red, White and Blue!
Uphold it! Protect it!
Where e’er you may be!
Watch o’er it! Adore it!
Sweet gem of the free.

CHORUS (Male Voices) 1-4.
Bright banner! dear banner!
Float over the land!
For thee and our country
United we stand.
Bright banner! dear banner!
Float over the land!
For thee and our country
United we stand.

2. Come forth to the conflict
The stern, bloody war!
Press forward, with shouting,
For liberty’s star!
’Tis a contest for Union and National Light!
The noble will triumph, God speedeth the Right!
Up yeomen! Come freemen!
The call is for you!
Don’t dally But rally! For Liberte true.

3. Oh, ye freemen awake,
And strike for the land
Now torn with dissensions
By dire traitor’s hand.
The warcry is sounding, our flag is unfurled,
In the cause of our Freedom we challenge the world.
Come forward! Press onward!
To succor the brave!
We need you! Will lead you!
Our country to save!

4. Hurrah for our banner!
The pride of the sea!
That starryhued emblem,
The flower of the free.
The token of Liberty, gem of the brave!
Sweet flag, waving over the patriots grave!
We love thee! Adore thee!
“Old Glory” so true!
Fall never! Wave ever!
Dear Red, White and Blue!
