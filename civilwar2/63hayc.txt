"How Are You Conscript?" [1863]
Words & Music by
Frank Wilder.

"How are you, Conscript?
How are you I say?
Have you got "three hundred greenbacks"
To pony up and pay?
If not you are a goner
Now dont you fret or cry.
For you’re only going to Dixie
To fight and "mind your eye."

1. “How are you, Conscript?”
“How are you today?”
The Provost Marshal’s got you in
A very “tight place” they say!
But O, you should not mind it
Nor breathe another sigh,
For you’re only going to Dixie
To fight and “mind your eye.”

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
O How are you, Conscript?
How are you today?
The Provost Marshal’s got you
In a very “tight place,” they say!

2. “How are you, Conscript?”
“How are you my boy?”
I ’spose you take it rather hard,
Since you’re your mother’s joy.
But “Uncle Sam” says you’re the one
To “go in” hip and thigh,
For you’re only going to Dixie
To fight and “mind your eye.”

3. “How are you, Conscript?”
“How are you I say?”
Have you got “three hundred greenbacks”
To “pony up” and pay?
If not you are “a goner”
Now don’t you fret and cry,
For you’re only going to Dixie
To fight and “mind your eye.”

4. “How are you, Conscript?”
“How are you today?”
You’ll give us all a “lock of hair”
Before you go away.
And when you do come home again.
You’ll “see it” same as I,
For you’re only going to Dixie
To fight and “mind your eye.”
