1. Move my armchair faithful Pompey, 
  In the sunlight clear and strong: 
For the world is fading Pompey. 
  Massa wont be with you long; 
And I fain would hear the southwind, 
  Bring once more the sound to me. 
Of the wavelets softly breaking, 
  On the shores of Tennessee; 
Of the wavelets softly breaking, 
  On the shores of Tennessee; 
Of the wavelets softly breaking, 
  On the shores of Tennessee.

2. Mournful through the ripples murmur, 
  As they still the story tell, 
How no vessels float the banner, 
  That I’ve loved so long and well; 
I shall listen to the music, 
  Dreaming that again I see Stars and Stripes 
Stars and Stripes on Sloop and Shallop, 
  Sailing up the Tennessee; 
Stars and Stripes on Sloop and Shallop, 
  Sailing up the Tennessee.

3. Thus he watches cloud bow shadows,
  Glide from tree to mountain crest;
Softly creeping, aye, and ever,
  To the rivers yielding breast;
Hi, above the foliage yonder,
  Something flutters bold and free,
Massa, massa, Hallelujah!
  The Flag’s come back to Tennessee.
Massa, massa, Hallelujah!
  The Flag’s come back to Tennessee.

4. Pompey, hold me on your shoulder,
  Help me stand on foot once more,
That I may salute the colors,
  As they pass my cabin door;
Never more shall treason trail thee,
  Glorious emblem of the free,
“God and Union” be our watchword,
  Ever more in Tennessee.
“God and Union” be our watchword,
  Ever more in Tennessee.
