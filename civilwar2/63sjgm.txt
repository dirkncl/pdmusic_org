[NOTE: the following "illustrative" words
appear in the score]

Stir up the camp fire bright;
Silence! ground arms! kneel all! caps off!
Old Blue Light's going to pray.

"Lay bare thine arm, stretch forth thy rod, Amen!"

He's in the saddle now!
Fall in! Steady!
The whole Brigade!

Ah! Maiden, wait and watch, and yearn,
For now, of Stonewall band!
Ah! wife, sew on, pray on, hope on!
Thy life shall not be all forlorn!
Hill's at the ford, cut off;
We'll win his way out, ball and blade.

Here's Longstreet struggling in the lists
Hemmed in an ugly gorge.

|: The foe  had better ne'er been born.
That gets in Stonewall's way. :|

"Bay'nets and grape!" hear Stonewall roar
"Charge, Stuart! pay off Ashby's score"
Charge! Charge!
Hurrah!
