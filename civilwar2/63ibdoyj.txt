1. I’ve been dreaming of you, Jessie,
Dreaming of you all the night;
And your voice has soothed me, Jessie,
And your face has been my light;
And upon my burning forehead,
Both your white hands softl\ly lay,
And I felt your arms around me
In the old caressing way.

CHORUS 1.
Oh! Jessie, dearest Jessie,
I felt your arms around me
In the old caressing way.

2. I’ve been dreaming of you, Jessie,
Of our home beside the deep,
In the olden walks I wandered,
Wandered with you in my sleep.
But the spring will call the summer;
Winter weep o’er autumn gone,
But together we may never
Watch the twilight, or the dawn.

CHORUS 2.
Oh! Jessie, dearest Jessie,
But together we may never
Watch the twilight, or the dawn.

3. I’ve been dreaming of you, Jessie,
And forgot the battle’s strife,
I forgot my pain and anguish,
When I heard your voice, sweet wife.
Now I know I ne’er shall enter,
Thro’ our little cottage gate,
That your loving eyes will weary,
Watching for me, while you wait.

CJORUS 3.
Oh! Jessie, dearest Jessie,
That your loving eyes will weary,
Watching for me, while you wait.

4. I’ve been dreaming of you, Jessie,
Of the day we said farewell,
When we spoke our parting blessings,
Oh! they seems so like a knell.
But the Book you gave me, Jessie,
Gave me strength when all was night,
It has taught me how to conquer
It, that other, better fight.

CHORUS 4.
Oh! Jessie, dearest Jessie,
It has taught me how to conquer
It, that other, better fight.

5. I am dying, darlingm Jessiem
An that Biblem it shall lay
On my breast, when I am buried;
From you, dearest, far away.
Faint not in the strife, my Jessie,
Until death shall give release,—
Father! bless her, and our Country,—
Let us meet where all is peace.

CHORUS 5.
Oh! Jessie, dearest Jessie,
Father! bless her, and our Country,—
Let us meet where all is peace.
