1.
Rebellion’s weak back
Has received a hard whack
From the hands of our noble defenders;
And we venture to say
All the rebel array
Feel like fellows with broken suspenders.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then Hurah for little Mac, Banks, Hooker and the like,
They will clean out this rebellion instantater
While brave Buel and Rosecrans,
In the West will make them dance
And the land will soon be cleared of every traitor.

2.
Or as if all the stitches
In their coats, vests and pantaloons,
Had been sewn with the weakest spool cotton,
As some garments are made
By the long credit trade
Most wtetchedly worthless and rotten.

3.
Yes, the traitors must be
In the highest degress
Disconcerted and sick of their treason;
And Jeff Davis may try
With Old Abraham vie,
But he’ll find himself cleaned out this season.

4.
And there’s old Johnny Bull,
He’s confoundedly dull
Or he’ll mind his own bus’ness just now sires,
For we Yankees can lick,
Old England right quick,
And the rest of creation, I vow sirs.

5.
But the patriot band
Feel each bosom expand
With delight when we view our proud banner,
Then we’ll shout for our flag,
While the traitors we’ll bag,
And Jeff Davis’es Government scatter.
