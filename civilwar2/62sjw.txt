1.
Come, stack arms, men pile on the rails,
Stir up the campfire bright;
No matter if the canteen fails,
We'll make a roaring night.
Here Shenandoah brawls along,
There burly Blue Ridge echoes strong,
To swell the Brigade's rousing song
Of Stonewall Jackson's way.

2.
We see him now, the old slouch'd hat
Cock'd o're his eye askew.
The shrew'd dry smile, the speech so pat,
So calm, so blunt, so true;
"The Blue Light Elder," knows 'em well:
Says he, "That's Banks, he's fond of shell;
Lord, save his soul! we'll give him"--well
That's Stonewall Jackson's way.

3.
Silence! ground arms! kneel all! Caps off!
Old Blue Light's going to pray;
Strangle the fool that dares to scoff!
Attention! 'tis his way!
Appealing from his native sod,
In forma pauperis to God.*
"Lay bear Thine arm, stretch forth Thy rod,
Amen!" That's Stonewall Jackson's way.

[* = "Hear us, Almightly God!"]

4.
He's in the saddle now! "Fall in!
Steady! the whole brigade!
Hill's at the ford, cut off; we'll win
His way out, ball and blade.
What matter if our shoes are worn?
What matter if our feet are torn?
Quick step! We're with him before dawn!"
That's Stonewall Jackson's way.

5.
The sun's bright lances rout the mists
Of morning--and by George!
Here's Longstreet struggling in the lists,
Hemmed in an ugly gorge.
Pope and his Yankees, whipped before,
"Bay'nets and grape!" hear Stonewall roar;
"Charge Stewart! Pay off Ashby's score,"
Is Stonewall Jackson's way.

6.
Ah, maiden, wait, and watch, and yearn
For news of Stonewall's band!
Ah, widow, read, with eyes that burn,
That ring upon thy hand!
Ah, wife, sew on, pray on, hope on!
Thy life shall not be all forlorn.
The foe had better ne'er been born
That gets in "Stonewall's way!"
