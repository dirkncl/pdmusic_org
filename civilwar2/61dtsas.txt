1.
Ye sons of Columbia, awake! arise! 
The blood of your brothers doth call to the skies! 
Their death now avenge! 
Your honor now save! 
Or with them go down to a patriot's grave! 
Their death now avenge! your honor now save, 
Or with them go down to a patriot's grave! 
The voices of your sires and homes, 
Are blended in on breath, 
Ascending up to God, 
For victory or death, 
For victory or death! 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Then on, on to battle, 
Ye brave men and true, 
Protect Freedom's standard, 
The Red, White & Blue! 
Then on, on to battle, 
Ye brave men and true, 
Protect - Freedom's standard, 
The Red, White and Blue! 
For victory or death!

2.
Your blood stained banner unfurl to the breeze, 
Be firm to defend it o'er land and o'er seas! 
The flag of your fathers, 
The flag of the free, 
The emblem of right and liberty! 
The flag of your fathers, the flag of the free, 
The emblem of right and liberty! 
The curse of Cain shall mark the brow 
Of him that e'er dare raise 
His arm to strike down Freedom's flag, 
Or fan disunion's blaze, 
Or fan disunion's blaze!      -      
Or fan disunion's blaze.
