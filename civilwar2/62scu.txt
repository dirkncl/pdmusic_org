1.
Massa gone, the news to hear,
And he has left de overseer
To look to all de Niggers hear,
  While I make love to Sally.
She's such a belle,
A real dark swell,
She dress so slick and looks so well,
Dar's not a gal like Sally.

CHORUS
Sally come up! oh, Sally go down!
oh, Sally come twist you heel around,
De old man he's gone down to town,
Oh Sally come down de middle.

2.
Last Monday night I gave a ball,
And I invite de Niggers all,
The thick, the thin, the short, the tall,
  But none came up to Sally!
And at the ball
She did lick 'em all;
Black Sal was de fairest gal of all
My lubly, charming Sally!

(CHORUS)

3.
De fiddle was play'd by Pompey Jones,
Uncle Ned he shook de bones,
Joe he play'd de pine stick stones;
  But dey couldn't play to Sally!
Old Dan Roe
play'd on the old banjo,
Ginger Blue de big drum blew;
But he couldn't blow like Sally.

(CHORUS)

[+]4.
Dar was dat lubly gal, Miss Fan,
Wid a face as broad as a frying-pan;
But Sally's is as broad again,
  Dar's not a face like Sally's!
She's got a foot
To full out de boot,
So broad, so long, as a gum-tree root,
Such a foot has Sally!

(CHORUS)

[+]5.
Sally can dance, Sally can sing,
De cat chocker reel, and break down fling;
To get de Niggers in a string,
  Dar's not a gal like Sally.
Tom, Sam, and Ned,
Day often wish me dead;
To dem both all tree I said,
Don't you wish you may get my Sally!

6.
Sally has got a lubly nose,
Flat across her face it grows,
It sounds like thunder when it blows,
  Such a lubly nose has Sally!
She can smell a rat,
So mind what you're at;
Its radar sharp although it's flat,
Is the lubly nose of Sally!

(CHORUS)

[+]7.
De oder night I said to she,
'I'll hab you if you'll hab me',
'All right says she, 'I do agree';
  So I smash up with Sally.
She's rader dark,
But quite up to de mark;
Neber was such a gal for a lark,
Such a clipper girl was Sally!

(CHORUS)
