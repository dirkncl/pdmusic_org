  A brave young soldier belonging to one of our Western 
regiments, fell mortally wounded at Stone River while 
fighting under the immediate eye of Gen: Reosencranz.  
The youth was taken to the nearest hospital and tenderly 
cared for by a benevolent matron, who, as his last hour 
approached was wiping his cold, clammy forehead.  With a 
smile of joy on his features, the youth took the hand of 
the lady and pressing it to his bosom softly whispered. 
"Is that Mother?" His sight grew dim and his strength 
failed him.  Nestling his head in the lady's breast he 
calmly expired, thinking he had drawn his last breath \
in the arms of his Mother.

1. Us that Mother bending o’er me,
As she sang ny cradle hymn?
Kneeling there in tears before me?
Say! my sight is growing dim.
Comes she from the old home lovely,
Out among the western hills;
To her pet boy dying slowly
Of war’s battles, wounds and ills.

CHORUS 1-2.
Mother fold your arms around me,
Press once more my aching head;
Sing the lullaby you sang me,
Kiss me Mother, ere I’m dead.

2. Mother Oh, we bravely battled—
Battled till the day was won;
While the leaden hail storm rattled,
Man to man, and gun to gun.
Though we conquer’d I am dying,
Dying in my boyhood years;
There, no weeping, selfdenying,
Noble deaths demands no tears.
