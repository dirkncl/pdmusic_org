[CHORUS]
||: Our banner of glory is waving on high--
Its stars are as thos of the even;
And its stripes life the mingling hues of the sky,
When the morning is blushing in heav'n. :||
[Tenor and Bass]
Wave on, wave on
[Soprano and Alto]
O'er the land and sea,
[Tenor and Bass]
Wave on, wave on,
[CHORUS]
Proud banner of the free.
Huzza! huzza! huzza! huzza!
[Soprano Solo]
It was born in the struggle of carnage and blood,
[Duo (Soprano and Tenor]
In its loveliness streaming abroad,
[Soprano and Bass]
Like the rainbow that bent o'er the desolate shore
As a sign and a promise from God.
[CHORUS]
No tyrant has claimed that flag for his own,
Its bright folds were never unfurl'd,
To flatter or shelter the glare of a throne--
That banner was born for the world.
[Soprano Solo]
And true to its missions wherever 'tis spread,
[Soprano and Tenor]
O'er the land, or the dark rolling sea;
[Soprano and Bass]
The tyrant and traitor have hail'd it with dread,
[Soprano, Tenor and Bass]
As the flag of the brave and the free.
[CHORUS]
That banner still radiant and floating on high;
From ocean to ocean shall reign;
To illumine the sea and to rival the sky
Whiile an empire on earth shall remain;
  To illumine the sea and to rival the sky
  While an empire on earth shall remain;
[Tenor and Bass]
Wave on, wave on
[Soprano and Alto]
O'er the Land and sea;
[Tenor and Bass]
Wave on, wave on,
[CHORUS]
Proud banner of the free
Huzza! huzza! huzza! huzza!
