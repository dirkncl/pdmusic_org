1.
We are coming, Father Abra’am, six hundred thousand more,
From Mississippi’s winding stream and from New England’s shore;
We leave our plows and workshops our wives and children dear.
With hearts too full for utterance with but a silent tear;
Oh we dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before—
We are coming Father Abra’am Six hundred thousand more!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We are coming, we are coming,
Our Union to restore;
We are coming Father Abra’am
With Six hundred thousand more.

2.
If you look across the hill tops that meet the northern sky,
Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;
And now the wind an instant, tears the cloudy veil aside.
And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride;
And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music play—
We are coming Father Abra’am Six hundred thousand more!

3.
If you look all up our valleys, Where the growing harversts shine,
You may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming in to line;
And children from their mother’s knees are pulling at the weeds.
And learning how to reap and sow against their country’s needs;
And a farewell group stand weeping at every cottage door—
We are coming Father Abra’am Six hundred thousand more!

4.
You have call’d us, and we’re coming, by Richmond’s bloody tide,
To lay us down for freedom’s sake, our brothers bones beside;
Or from foul treason’s savage group to wrench the murderous blade.
And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade;
Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before—
We are coming Father Abra’am Six hundred thousand more!
