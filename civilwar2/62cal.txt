1.
Up, on the hill! there,
Who are they pray?
Three dusty troopers
Spurring this way,
And that squadron behind them,
Stand not aghast,
Why these are the Rebels, Sir,
Coming at last!
These are the Rebels, Sir,
Coming at last!

2.
Coming so carelessly,
Sauntering on,
Into the midst of us,
Into our town;
Thrice thirty miles to day
These men had pass'd --
Stuart at the head of them,
Coming at last!
Stuart at the head of them,
Coming at last!

3.
O, Sir, no [gwb?], [lace?]
Burns in the sun,
But each blooded war-horse
And rider seems one;
These men could ride at need,
Out-ride the blast,
O, yes, Sir, the Rebels are
Coming at last!
Yes, Sir, the Rebels are
Coming at last!

4.
Circling Mar's army,
Three days at work,
Under that smile of theirs
Famine may lurk,
Out with the best you have,
Fill the bowl fast,
For Jeff's Ragged Riders are
Coming at last!
Jeff's Ragged Riders are
Coming at last!
