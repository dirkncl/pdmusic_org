1. I know a maiden fair to see: Take care!
She can both false and friendly be.

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not, Trust her not,
She’s fooling thee.
Trust her not,
She’s fooling thee.

2. She has two eyes so soft and brown: Take care!
Gives a side glance, and then locks down.

3. And she has hair of a raven hue: Take care!
And what she says, it is not true.

3. She gives thee a garland passing fair: Take care!
’Tis a fool’s cap for thee to wear.
