1. God’s blessing be upon
Our own, our Native Land!
The Land our Fathers won
By the strong heart and hand,
The keen axe and the brand;
When they fell’d the forest’s pride,
And the tyrant foe dedied,
The free, the rich, the wide;
God for our Native Land!
God for our Native Land!

2. Up with the starry sign,
The red stripes and the white!
Where’er its glories shine,
In peace or in the fight,
We own its high command:
For the Flag our Fathers grave,
O’er our children’s heads shall wave,
And their children’s children’s grave:
God for our Native Land!
God for our Native Land!
