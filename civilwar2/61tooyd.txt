1. Once on a time old Johnny Bull,
  Flew in a raging, fury,
And swore that Jonathan should have
  No trials, sir, by jury,
That no elections should be held,
  Across the briny waters,
“And now,” said he, “I’ll tax the tea
  Of all his sons and daughters.”
Then down he sate in burly state,
  And bluster’d like a grandee,
And in derision made a tune
  Call’d “Yankee doodle dandy.”
“Yankee doodle” these are facts
  “Yankee dooddle dandy;
My son of wax, you tea I’ll tax
  Yankee doodle dandy.”

2. John sent the tea from o’er the sea
  With heavy duties rated;
But whether hyson or bohea,
  I never hear it stated.
Then Jonathan to pout began—
  He laid a strong embargo—
“I’ll drink no tea, by Jove!” so he
  Thru overboard the cargo,
Then Johnny sent a regiment,
  His words and looks to bandy,
Whose martial hand, when near the land,
  Play’d “Yankee doodle dandy”
“Yankee doodle— keep it up!
  Yankee doodle dandy!
I’ll poison with a tax your cup,
  Yankee doodle dandy!”

3. A long war then they had, in which
  John was at last defeated—
And “Yankee doodle” was the march
  To which his troups retreated.
Cute Jonathan, to see them fly,
  Could not restrain his laughter;
“That tune,” said he, “suits to a T,
  I“ll sing it ever after.”
Old Johnny’s face, to his disgrace,
  Was flush’d with beer and brandy,
E’en while he swore, to sing no more,
  This “Yankee doodle dandy.
Yankee doodle— ha!— ha!— ha!—
  Yankee doodle dandy—
We kept the tune, but not the tea—
  Yankee doodle dandy!”

4. I’ve told you now the origin
  Of this most lively ditty,
Which Johnny Bull dislikes as “dull
  And stupid!”— what a pity!
With “Hail Columbia!” it is sung,
  In chorus full and hearty—
On land and main, we breathe the strain,
  John made for his tea party.
No matter how we rhyme the words,
  The music speaks them handy,
And where’s the fair can’t sing the air,
  Of “Yankee doodle dandy!
Yankee doodle— firm and true—
  Yankee doodle dandy.
Yankee doodle, doodle doo!
  Yankee doodle dandy!"
