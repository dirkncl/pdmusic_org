AN INCIDENT.--At the battle of Winchester, March 23rd, 1862, 
a youth fell mortally wounded.  One of his comrades lifted 
him up and supported him in a sitting posture, gave him some 
water from his canteen and bathed his forehead.  The dying 
soldier breathed a prayer for his parents far away, then 
pointing to where the battle was still raging said, "Follow 
the Flag," and died.

1. He fell, the noble patriot boy,
A few days since his mother’s joy;
His life a sacrifice he gave,
His country’s dearer life to save.
A comrade halted by his side
And sought to staunch the crimson tide.
But vain his arts; the would is deep,
Life ebbs, He soon will fall asleep.

2. He bathed his brow and bade him drink,
And spake such words as he could think,
To make his dying moments sweet,
Nor did he Jesus’ name forget.
A smile lights up the soldier’s brow,
He knows that he is dying now.
He thinks of home— the lov’d ones there;
For each he breathes a fervent prayer.

3. Then turns his eye and waves his hand
Towards that heroic, patriot band,
Whose toils he hitherto hath shared,
Whose noblest daring he hath dared.
There floats amid the murky air,
The nation’s ensign bright and fair,
To it he points, and then, at length,
Cries “Follow the Flag,” with all his strength.

4. His soul hath fled to its native sky,
But ever his comrades hear that cry:
And “Follow the Flag,” is watchword dear,
To all who knew its another here.
So, too, shall Zion’s sons repeat,
This war cry; and their foes defeat;
For, “Follow the Flag,” shall ever be
The key note of their victory.
