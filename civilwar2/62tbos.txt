1. With deep affection and recollection,
  I often think of those Shandon Bells,
Whose sound so wild, would in days of childhood,
  Fling round my cradle their magic spells.
On this I ponder, where e’er I wander,
  And thus grow fonder sweet Cork of thee;
With thy Bells of Shandon, that sound so grand on
  The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

CHORUS
With thy [Made the] Bells of Shandon sound far more grand on
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

2. I’ve heard Bells chiming full many a clime in,
  Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine,
While at a glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate,
  But all their music spoke naught like thine;
For mem’ry dwelling on each proud swelling
  Of thy belfry knelling its bold notes free,
Made the Bells of Shandon sound far more grand on
  The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

3. I’ve heard bells tolling “Old Adrian’s Mole” in,
  Their thunder rolling from the Vatican,
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious,
  In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame;
But thy sounds were sweeter, than the dome of Peter
  Flings o’er the Tiber, pealing solemnly.
O! the Bells of Shandon sound far more grand on
  The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

4. There’s a bell in Mosgow, while on tower and kiosko
  In St. Sophia the Turkman gets,
And loud in air, calls men to prayer
  From the tapering summit of tall minarets.
Such empty phantom, I freely grant them,
  But there’s an anthem more dear to me,
Tis the Bells of Shandon, that sound so grand on
  The pleasant waters of the river Lee.
