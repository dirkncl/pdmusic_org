1. Let us cast to the breeze, where so long it has waved
  The “Flag of our Union” unsullied— undimed;
Undeminished in number the stars there engraved;
  By our fathers bequeathed by Columbia limned!
Let it gallantly wave; that proud Flag of the free,
  A protector in peace, but a terror in warl
Let it flaunt in the breeze, let it skim every sea
  And bear on its folds every star— Thirty Four!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let it gallantly wave; that proud flag of the free,
  A protec tor in peace, but a terror in war;
Let it flaunt to the breeze, let it skim ev’ry sea
  And bear on its folds ev’ry star— Thirty Four!

2. Let it tell to the nations oppressed and enslaved,
  Of a land where its children are happy and bless’t,
Of a land where in triumph it proudly has waved
  While a world  has admired its power confess’t;
Shall it droop in  its manhood, that flag which has won
  Every nation’s respect, or in commerce or war?
Not undimed ev’ry star, while it floats ’neath the sun
  Shall be fixed never dying, at least Thirty Four!

3. Tho’ traitors may rise in the land which our sires
  Bequeathed as a boon which their valor had gained
One thought of the emblem they gave us inspires
  The wish— the resolve that it shall be maintained!
Tho’ oceans of blood shall encrimsn the land
  In the cause— tho’ the cost we may sadly deplor—
Intarnished thy glory forever must stand
  Undimed in their lusre the stars— Thirty Four!
