1. See they come, see they come from the mountain and the plain,
A noble band of Patriots the Union to maintain
And they never will return, till the Country stand again
  United firm and free!

CHORUS 1.
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
His soul is marching on!

2. Their sabres now are ready, their hearts are all aglow,
The flashing of the steel lights their pathway as they go,
And the booming of the cannon strikes terror to the foe.
  The coward, traitor slave!

CHORUS 2.
Onward, onward band victorious,
See the traitor fly before us,
Strike! our flag is waving o’er us,
  The Standard of the free!
