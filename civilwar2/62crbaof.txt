1. Come rally boys around our flag,
Guard well each sacred fold
For what that Flag is worth to man,
Can ne’er in woods be told!
Keep it as you would keep your hearts
From stain of error free
Love it as you must love your God,
Your house, your liberty!
Come rally boys around our Flag
Guard well each sacred fold
For what that Flag is worth to man
Can ne’er in words be told.

2. Oh! life were but a worthless boon,
If Liberty were dead
For with the loss of Liberty,
The soul of life is fled!
The air we breathe, the ground we tread
Are free alike to all
Yet free no more if traitorlike,
We see our Banner fall.
Come rally boys around our Flag
Guard well each sacred fold
For what that Flag is worth to man
Can ne’er in words be told.

3. We have a goodly heritage
Bought by our fathers’ blood
We will not prove unworthy sons,
But stand as once they stood!
Shoulder to shoulder in the field
Where death and danger dwell
And  never, never, can we yield
The FLAG we LOVE so well!
Come rally boys around our Flag
Guard well each sacred fold
For what that Flag is worth to man
Can ne’er in words be told.

4. “’Tis sweet and right” the poet wrote,
For Country dear to die
Then let us live beneath its folds,
Or ’neath its shadow lie!
Emblem of all our dearest hopes,
Beneath these lower skies
To loftiest height in Freedom’s Might,
OUR STARRY FLAG SHALL RISE!
Come rally boys around our Flag
Guard well each sacred fold
For what that Flag is worth to man
Can ne’er in words be told.
