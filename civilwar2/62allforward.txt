1. All forward to battle!
The trumpets are crying
Forward! All forward, our old flag is flying,
When Liberty calls us, we linger no longer;
Rebels come on!
Though a thousand to one.
Liberty! Liberty! deathless and glorious,
Under thy banner, thy sons are victorious,
Free souls are valiant, and strong arms are stronger,
God shall go with us, and battle be won.
Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for the banner, the flag of the free!

2. All forward to conquer!
Where free hearts are beating,
Death to the coward,
who dreams of retreating,
Liberty calls us, from mountain, and valley,
Waving her banner, she leads to the fight.
Forward! all forward!
The trumpets are crying;
The drum beats to arms,
and our old flag is flying;
Stout hearts, and strong hands around it shall rally.
Forward to battle for God and the Right!
Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for the banner,
The flag of the free!

All forward!
All forward!
