1. Is that mother bending o’er me, 
As she sang my cradle hymn
Kneeling there in tears before me,
Say; my sight is growing dim.
Comes she from the old home lowly
Out among the northern hills.
To her pet boy dying slowly,
Of war’s battles wounds and ills.

CHORUS 1.
Yes: my boy it is your mother:
Came I from our Northern hills,
To my pet boy dying slowly,
Of war’s battles, wounds and ills.
Rest, my child, ’tis Jesus calls you,
Calls you to His fold above.
I resign my darling hero
To His arms He knows but love.

2. Motherm Oh! we bravely battledm
Battled ’till the day was done
While the leaden hail storm rattled,
Man to man and gun to gun,
But we fail’d and I am dying,
Dying in my boyhood’s years.
There; no weeping self denying.
Noble death demands no tears.

CHORUS 2.
Fold again your arms around me,
Press again my aching head,
Sing the lullaby you sang me,
Kiss me mother ere I’m dead.
Sleep, my child, ’tis Jesus call you,
Calls you to His fold above.
I resign my darling hero
To His arms He knows but love.
