"Kingdom Coming" (not dated)
by W. Howard Doane

1.
Dis darkey's nothing but a contraband.
But I'e learned some things in dixie's land
How the massa brags & tink's he's some,
[unreadable]

CHORUS
[unreadable]

2.
Old mass says he'll take Washington
And says ole Abe have the tea all on
In Richmond he'll take his dinner at one
An tinks he'll go denst night to Kingdom come
In Richmond he took his dinner at one
But did not take his tea in Washington.

(CHORUS)

3.
No massa said dat cotton was king
But dis darkey tink tis no such ting
Case when massa hear de Yankee drum
He sends his cotton to de Kingdom come
When massa hear dat linkum drum
He sure nough begin's to tink of Kingdom come

(CHORUS)

4.
Dis darkey's now better dan ole overseer
He eat all de cake drink wine and beer
In de parlor you'll find him always at home.
And sure nuff he thinks de Kingdom come
In de parlor you'll find him always at home
For sure nuff he tinks de Kingdom come
