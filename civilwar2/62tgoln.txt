1. Brightly shine the stars above me,
In the clear unclouded sky,
While the night winds, soft and gentle
Mourning sadly pass one by
Earth seems bush’d in quiet slumber,
Silence round hath cast her spell,
While I weep so sad and lonely
O’er the grave, the grave, of little Nell,
  While I weep so sad and lonely,
  O’er the grave, the grave of little Nell.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For when golden day light closes
And the streamlet sighs farewell
Oft my tears bedew the roses
O’er the grave of little Nell.

2. Oft in dreams again I see her,
With her eye of azure blue,
With her smile of angel sweetness
And her curls of sunny hue;
Sadly, then, I wake, and wander,
Through the bright and flow’ry dell,
Down to where the streamlet ripples
Near the grave, the grave of little Nell,
  Down to where the streamlet ripples
  Near the grave, the grave of little Nell.

3. Ah my heart is sad and lonely,
Since my darling went away,
Yet her pure and holy image
In my heart will ever play
O’er her grave the wild rost bloometh,
With the fragrant bright blue bell,
Song birds wake, their sweetest music
Round the grave, the grave, of little Nell,
  Song birds wake, their sweetest music
  Round the grave, the grave of little Nell.
