1.
Bright Banner of Freedom! with pride I unfold thee,
Fair flag of my country, with love I behold thee,
Gleaming above us in freshness and youth,
Emblem of Liberty, symbol of truth,
Emblem of Liberty, Symbol of truth,
Symbol of truth.

CHORUS
For this flag of my country in triumph shall wave
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.
For this flag of my country in triumph shall wave
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.

2.
All bright are the Stars that are beaming upon us,
And bold are the Bars that are gleaming above us,
The one shall increase in their number and light,
The other grow bolder in power and might,
The other grow bolder in power and might,
In power and might.

CHORUS
For this flag of my country in triumph shall wave
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.
For this flag of my country in triumph shall wave
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.

3.
Those Bars of bright red show our firm resolution
To die, if need be, shielding thee from polution;
For man in this hour, must give all he holds dear,
And woman her pray'rs and her words of high cheer,
And woman her pray'rs and her words of high cheer,
Her words of high cheer.

CHORUS
If they wish this fair banner in triumph must wave,
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.
If they wish this fair banner in triumph must wave,
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.

4.
To the great God of Battle we look with reliance,
On our fierce Northern foe with contempt and defiance;
For the South shall smile on in her fragrance and bloom
When the North is fast sinking in silence and gloom,
When the North is fast sinking in silence and gloom,
In silence and gloom.

CHORUS
For this Flag of my country is triumph must wave,
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.
For this Flag of my country is triumph must wave,
O're the Southerners' home and the Southerners' grave.
