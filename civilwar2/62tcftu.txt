1. Sadly we grieve when we think of the tears, 
Our dear ones must shed overwhelmed by their fears; 
A busband or brother may never return,— 
Alas! there’ll be mana, too mana to mourn.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
But our cause is a just one, 
To war! then, to war! 
Three cheers for the Union, 
Hurrah! boys, Hurrah! 
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! 
Three cheers for the Union, 
Hurrah! boys, Hurrah!

2. Farewell then, beloved one, take courage and trust—
Our promise to win may not prove a vain boast;
And oh, if in battle we die on the field,
It is in our Maker alone that we yield!
