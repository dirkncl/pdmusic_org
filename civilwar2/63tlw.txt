1. Oh! that I were a bird in the air,
  My love,
Sporting about on its pinions so free;
I’d fly from earth with its woe and its care,
  My love,
I’d fly to Heaven, for I’d fly to thee.

2. Music’s sweet notes at dawning of day,
    My love,
  Should be thine ear my first offering be;
Still would hover at evening’s decay.
    My love,
  Singing untiring lovesongs to thee.

3. Then would I seek my haven of rest,
    My love,
  Bidding adieu to all sorrow and pain;
There in thy heart would I make my own nest,
      My love,
  Never to part from thee, dearest, again.
