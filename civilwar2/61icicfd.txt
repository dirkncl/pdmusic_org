1. O have you beem in Dixie’s Land,

Whar nigger’s dance an have a spree,
De banjo tinkling on dar knee, 
Faraway! Faraway! in dat happy land!

I come! I come! I come from down in Dixie’s Land,
An trabbled all de way!

De fellers take dem round de waiste,
And call ’em sweet as jujupaste,
Faraway! Faraway! in dat happy land!

3. Will deweaber’s wife is dead,
