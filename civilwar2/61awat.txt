1.
The birds sleeping gently,
Sweet Lyra gleameth bright;
Her rays tinge the forest,
And all seems glad tonight,
The wind's sighing by me,
Cooling my fever'd brow;
The stream flows as ever,
Yet Alice where art thou!
One year back this even,
And thou were by my side;
And thou wert by my side,
Vowing to love me,
One year past this even,
And thou wert by my side;
Vowing to love me
Alice what e'er might betide.

2.
The silver rain falling,
Just as it falleth now;
And all things slept gently!
Ah! Alice where art thou!
I've sought thee by lakelet,
I've sought thee on the hill,
And in the pleasant wildwood,
When winds blew cold and chill;
I've sought thee in forest,
I'm looking heav'nward now;
I'm looking heav'nward now
Oh! there, mid the starshine,
I've sought thee in forest,
I'm looking heav'nward now.
Oh! there amid the starshine, 
Alice, I know art thou.
