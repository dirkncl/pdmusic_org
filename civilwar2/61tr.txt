1.
What a charm has the drum, with its tan-a-ran-tan,
When we march to the gay parade!
O! the music we love is the bold rataplan
And the "rub-a-dub" merrily played.
Ev'ry heart is inspired by its magical sound,
There's a soul in the stirring drum,
And there is not a voice while its echoes rebound
But would cry, "let the enemy come."

[CHORUS [repeat after each verse]]
[So|Then] merrily O! so cheerily O! so merrily march away
rataplan ratplan rataplan rataplan!
March away while we may 'tis a gay gala day
And our banners are flaunting high;
In the sun swords and gun flash around ev'ry one
With a glance just as bright as the sky.
Rataplan! 
Rataplan! tan-a-ran!
rataplan! tan-a-ran!
rataplan! tan-a-ran!
rataplan!
rataplan! tanaran!
rataplan! rataplan!
tanaran! tanaran!

2.
To the field when we march, how the tan-a-ran-tan
Makes the heart of the Soldier glow!
Let him hear but the roll of the bold rataplan,
And how gallantly forward he'll go,
When the battle is done and the victory won
Still the sound of the rolling drum
Sends its echoes afar from the red field of war
To the dear friends who welcome us home.
