1.
Father! I bend to thee.
Life, it was thy gift
Thou now can'st shield it,
From thee it came, and to thee I yield it,
In life or death forsake not me.
Father I bend to thee.

2.
Father! I trust in thee,
When mid'st the Battle's strife,
Death did surround me,
E'en at the cannon's mouth,
Death has not found me,
Father 'twas thy will; I trust in thee.

3.
All I give back to thee,
When at thy call I my Life thou shall yield,
When in the cold tomb, my fate shall be seal'd,
Father, my soul take unto thee.
Father forsake not me.
