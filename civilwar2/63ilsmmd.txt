1. I’m lonely since my mother died,
Tho’ friends and kindred gather near.
I cannot check the rising sigh,
Or stay the silent heartfelt tear;
Of earthly friends she was the best.
My er’ring youthful steps to guide;
Oh, do not smile because I weep,
I’m lonely since my mother died.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I’m lonely since my mother died,
Tho’ friends and kindred gather near,
I cannot check the rising sigh,
Or stay the heartfelt silent tear.

2. You may not deem it brave or strong,
To let these tears so often flow,
But those who’ve lost a mother’s love,
Can tell the pain of my sad woe,
Could I but call her back again
And kneel once more down by her side,
I'd love her better than before.
I'm lonely since my mother died.

3. Oh, you who have a mother dear,
Let not a word or act give pain,
But cherish, love her with your life,
You ne’er can have her like again,
Then when she’s called from you away,
Across death’s dark and troubled tide,
In pain with me you need not say,
I’m lonely since my mother died.
