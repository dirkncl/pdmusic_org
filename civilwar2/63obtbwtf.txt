1. Oh bury the brave on the field where they fall; 
Let them sleep beneath the sod. 
That drank up their blood in the deadly affray, 
When their spirits went home to God; 
Let their resting place be where their brave deeds were done, 
With the banner, the banner for their shroud; 
And its stars shall keep watch as they peacefully sleep, 
Far away from the gathering crowd.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Then sleep on and soft be thy repose, 
And green be the turf on thy breast 
The glorious stars shall watch, 
(shall watch) of our banner shall watch 
O’er the graves where the heroes rest, (softly rest).

2. Though nameless the graves where their ashes repose 
All unhallowed by tears. 
Their laurels are fadeless, they never can die, 
While we measure the fleeting years; 
Though no marble may rise o’er their low lonely beds, 
There to point out the sacred, sacred spot, 
Yet the hearts of the nation their memory will keep, 
Its dead heroes are never forgot.

3. The sunlight and rain will awaken the flow’rs 
That in beauty o’er them wave. 
The soft whispering breezes a requiem said, 
Murm’ring over their lonely grave; 
But we mourn for them not as all calmly they sleep, 
Far away from the loving household band. 
For the brave and the noble die never in vain, 
When they die for their native land.
