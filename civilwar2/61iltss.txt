1. I love the land where freedom wails,
  And heroes dar’d to die;
Where perfumed winds from flow’ry vales,
  In mournful accents sigh!
Where perfumed winds from flow’ry vales,
  In mournful accents sigh!

CHORUS 1-4.
I know the land, I love the land,
  I love the land where freedom wails,
And heroes dar’d to die;
  Where perfumed winds from flow’ry vales
In mournful accents sigh!

2. I love the land where willow waves,
  And fragrbnt valleys weep:
With sorrowing tears upon the graves,
  Where patriot heroes sleep!
With sorrowing tears upon the grave,
  Where patriot heroes sleep!

3. I love the land where woman goes,
  At sunset’s stilly hour,
To scatter where the dead repose,
  The teardrops and the flow’r!
To scatter where the dead repose,
  The teardrop and the flow’r!

4. Oh! sunny land! tho’ fallen now,
  New honors thou shalt claim;
And nations yet shalt bind thy brow
  In glorious wreathes of fame!
And nations yet shall bind thy brow,
  In glorious wreathes of fame!
