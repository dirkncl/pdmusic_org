1. Oh silence, wondrous and profound,
O’er earth doth solitide still reign,
The woods alone incline their heads,
The woods alone incline their heads,
As if the Lord walked o’er the plain,
As if the Lord walked o’er the plain.

2. I feel new life within me glow
Where now is my distress and care
Here in the blush of waking morn,
Here in the blush of waking morn,
I blush at yesterday’s despair,
I blush at yesterday’s despair.

3. To me a pilgrim shall the world
With all its joy and sorrows, be,
But as a bridge that leads O Lord,
But as a bridge that leads O Lord,
Across the stream of time to Thee,
Across the stream of time to Thee.

4. And should my song woo worldly gifts,
The base rewards of vanity,
Doth down my lyre, I’ll hold my peace,
Doth down my lyre, I’ll hold my peace,
Before Thee to eternity,
Before Thee to eternity.
