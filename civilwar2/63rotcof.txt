1. Our call is for the Freemen, with hearts both true and brave,
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom! 
Whose hands are strong to grasp the sword, our native land to save 
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Liberty forever! Shout aloud, Hurrah! 
Down with rebellion, Honor to the law, 
From East and West the answer comes 
With shouts that rend the sky. 
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom.

2. And the answer comes out boldly, from the States both near and far,
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!
Who look with anxiouslonging, for freedom’s rising star.
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!

3. Then let no patriot loiter, while we’re marching to the fray,
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom,
But with honest hand, and purpose true, advance the glorious day,
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!

4. As we see the light now breaking upon our southern sky,
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!
Let us rouse us from our lethargy and raise the battle cry.
Roll on the glorious cause of freedom!
