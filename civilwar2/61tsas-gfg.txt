1. The Stars and Stripes! what hand shall dare
  To desecrate the flag we bear?
The flag of stars, whose cheering light
  Beamed through oppression’s gloomy night.
The flag of stripes, whose heavenly dyes
  Flashed Freedom’s dayspring through the skies!
Our flag! Our flag! The standard of the free!
  Symbol of hop and liberty!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The flag of stripes, whose heavenly dyes
Flashed Freedom’s dayspring through the skies!
Our flag! Our flag! The standard of the free!
Symbol of hope and liberty!

2. The Stars and Stripes! What memories rise,
  Whene’er that banner greet our eyes?
By patriots borne, o’er land and sea,
  It led the way to victory!
When slaughter swept the surging main—
  When carnage strewed the crimson plain—
It marked the spot where heroes stood,
  It was babtized in heroes’ blood!

3. The Stars and Stripes! What power shall stay
  Immortal Freedom’s onward way?
The heavens are the triumphal arch
  Through which she takes her mighty march!
Her mighty march! Now shall she halt
  ’Till, like the spangled azure vault,
O’er every land around the world
  The Stars and Stripes shall be unfurled!
