1. Tho’ the tempest of strife and storms of disunion 
Unfurl their dark wings o’er rebellion and night, 
We’ll trust to the pow’r that has made us a Union, 
To guide us thro’ darkness to justice and right; 
Our hearts shall be true to the pulse of the nation, 
In marches of freedom, majestic, sublime. 
In tune with each changing and onward vibration 
That echoes along the grand circles of time. 

CHORUS 1
On, Freemen, on! let it swell from the valley!
On, Freemen, on! let it ring o’er the plain! 
’Tis the call of our nation, O let us all rally, 
Rebellion to conquer, and glory to gain.

2. Swell forth, oh thou [?-?] of war! there in valor
That wakes to your sounding, that springs to your cry,
That bears on its armor no fear and no pallor,
When standard is peace— though to gain it we die—
Swell forth, oh thou [?-!?] the soul of our Nation
Is ever in tune with the cause of the right;
A Genious reigns over the laws of emotion.
An Angel of Progress— a Goddess of Light.

CHORUS 2
On, Freemen, on! let it swell from the valley!
On, Freemen, on! let it ring o’er the plain!
’Tis the call of our Nation, oh let us all rally,
Rebellion to conquer, and glory to gain! 

3. Away in the ranks where the strife is advancing!
Away to the plain where the warrior lies low!
Away to the field where the sabre is glancing
Its venomous steel to the breast of the foe!
Oh sound the alarm from border to border!
Ring out the new song of our Nation’s release!
O’er the last  pale foe and rebellious marauder
Unfurl the white banner of triumph and peace.

CHORUS 3
Sound the alarm! let it ring o’er the valley!
On to the rescue, from city and plain!
’Tis the call of our Nation, oh let us all rally,
Rebellion to conquer, and freedom to gain!
