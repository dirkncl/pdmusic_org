1. My child! oh my child! thou art weary tonight; 
Thy spirit is sad, and dim in the light; 
Thou wouldst call me back from the echoless shore, 
To the trials of life, to thy heart as of yore. 
Thou longest again for my fond loving care, 
For my kiss on thy lip, and my hand on thy hair; 
But angels around thee their loving watch keep, 
And angels, my darling, will “rock thee to sleep.” 

2. “Backward?” say onward! ye swift rolling years; 
Gird on thy armor! keep back thy tears! 
O count not thy trials nor efforts in vain; 
They’ll bring thee the light of thy childhood again. 
Ye should not weary my child by the way, 
But watch for the light of that brighter day; 
Not tired of “sowing for others to reap,” 
For angels my darling will “rock thee to sleep.”

3.  Weary my child of the “base, and untrue,”
Oh! I have tasted the cup they give you;
I’ve felt the deep grief in the dark living green
Of a low mossy grave, by a silvery stream;
But the dear mother I sought for in vain,
Is an angel presence, and with me again,
And in the still night, from the silence so deep,
Will come the bright angels to “rock me to sleep.”

4. Nearer thee now than in days that are flown,
Purer the lovelight encircling thy home;
Far more enduring the watch for tonight;
Than even earthworship away from the light;
Soon the dark shadows will linger no more,
Nor come at thy call from the opening door;
But know thou my child, that the angels watch keep,
And soon, very soon, they will “rock thee to sleep.”
