1. The breath and bloom of summer, 
Are filling the dreamy air; 
The music of birds and the song of bees, 
Are echoing ev’rywhere. 
And smiles on each lip are beaming, 
To welcome the summer joys; 
But each heart in its fondest dreaming, 
Is ever with our brave boys. 

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Honor to all brave soldiers, 
Come they from East or West; 
Our hopes and blessings shall follow them all, 
But we love our brave boys the best.

2. When storms o’er the earth are sweeping, 
And cold falls the pityless rain, 
Bright eyes for our boys are weeping, 
And tender hearts throbbing with pain. 
Gladly would we deprive ours 
Of home’s sweet comforts and joys; 
Could we shower those blessings and pleasures, 
On the camp of our own brave boys.
