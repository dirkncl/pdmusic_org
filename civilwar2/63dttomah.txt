1. Do they think of my at home?
Do they ever think of me?
I, who shar’d their ev’ry grief,—
I, who mingled in their glee?
Have their hearts grown cold and strange
To the one now doom’d to roam?
I would give the world to know—
Do they think of me at home?
I would give the world to know—
Do they think of me at home?

2. Do they think of me at eve?
Of the songs I used to sing?
Is the harp I struck untouched?
Does a stranger wake the string?
Will no kind, forgiving word,
Come across the raging foam?
Shall I never cease to sigh—
Do they think of me at home?
Shall I never cease to sigh—
Do they think of me at home?

3. Do they think of how I loved
In my happy early years?
Do they think of him who came,
But could never win their praise?
I am happy by his side,
And from mine he’ll never roam!
But my heart will sadly ask—
Do they think of me at home?
But my heart will sadly ask—
Do they think of me at home?
