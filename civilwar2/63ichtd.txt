1. Unwelcome winds are sighing,
Within the distant west,
And wrapt in pain, I’m lying,
With vision broken rest.
I often dream thy bosom
Iis pillowing  my head,
And wake to find illusion
Has gathered round me bed,
But starting from my dreaming,
I check the rising sigh,

[Refrain 1-3.]
For I'm coming home to die mother!
I’m coming home to die!

2. I long to see thee mother, 
And kiss thy dear old cheek;
I feel there is no other
With whom I wish to speak;
No heart has half such kindness;
No voice such music’s flow;
Why did I in my blindness,
Cause you a moments woe?
I know you’ve mourn.d full often,
But wipe the glist’ning eye,

3. My memory is clinging
Tto childhood’s sunny hours,
And sister’s voice seems ringing
Amid the garden flow’rs;
The moments seem to lengthen
As starting hour drawn near,
And hope begins to strengthen
WIth thoughts of leaving here;
So let the heart be gladden’d
Our meeting hour is nigh,
