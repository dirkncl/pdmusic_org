1. A path on a mountain side,
  When the sun first gilds the deep,
And merrily will we ride,
  While the drowsy world’s asleep.
Our fairy coursers shall seem to fly,
  As o’er the ground we go,
Till wood and plain and sea and sky,
  Are lost in the mist below:
The matinal lark shall respond
  To the bee as he sips the flower:
But I have no fairy wand,
  And wishing hast lost its power.

2. A lake and a fairy boat,
  To sail on the moonbeam clear;
And merrily will we float
  From the dragons that watch us here.
Thy gown shall be of the snowwhite silk,
  And strings of orient pearls.
Like summer gossamer dipp’d in milk,
  Shall twine in thy raven curls.
Red rubies shall deck thy hands,
  And diamonds by thy dower;
But fairies have broken thei wands,
  And wishing hath lost its power.
