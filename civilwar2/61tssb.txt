1. Oh! say can you see by the dawn’s early light
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose stripes and bright stars, thro’ the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watch’d, were so gallantly streaming;
And the rocket’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was still there!

CHORUS [sung twice]
Oh! say, does that star spangled banner yet  wave,
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

2. On the shore dimly seen thro’ the mist of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half disclosdes?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines in the stream;

CHORUS [sung twice]
’Tis the star spangled banner Oh! long may it wave,
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

3. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
’Mid the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,
A home and a country they’d Leave us no more!
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution;
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,

CHORUS [sung twice]
And the star spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

4. Oh thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war’s desolation;
Blest with vict’ry and peace, may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved as a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto, “In God is our trust,”

CHORUS [sung twice]
And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave,
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

5. When our land is illum’d with liberty’s smile,
If a foe from within strike a blow at her glory,
Down, down with the traitor that dares to defile
The flag of her stars and the page of her glory,
By the millions unchain’d who our birthright have gained,
We will keep her bright blazon forever unstain’d!

CHORUS [sung twice]
And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave
While the land of the free is the home of the brave!
