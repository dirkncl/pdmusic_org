1. On Richmond’s blood red battle field,
  A soldier dying lay,
His tho’ts were of his mountain home
  Some thousand miles away
He call’d his comrade to his side
  For much he had to say
In briefest time to those who were,
  Some thousand miles away.

2. My father comrade you will tell,
  About this bloody fray,
My country’s standard say to him
  Was safe with me today
I’ve made a pillow of it now
  On which to lay my head
A winding sheet you’ll make of it,
  When I am with the dead.

3. I know t’will grieve his inmost soul,
  To think that never more,
I’ll sit with him beneath the oak
  That shades our cottage door
But tell the time worn patriot
  That mindful of his fame
Upon this bloody battle field,
  I sullied not his name.

4. My mother’s form is with me now,
  Her wail is in mine ear;
And drop by drop as flows my blood,
  So drops from her the tear.
Then O! when you shall tell to her
  The tidings of this day,
Speak softly, comrade, softly speak,
  What you may have to say.

5. Speak not to her in hurried words,
  The blighting news you bear;
The cords of life might snap too soon;
  So comrade have a care.
I am her only cherished child,
  But tell her that I died
Rejoicing that she taught my young,
  To take my country’s side.

6. But comrade there is one I fain
  Once more would look upon;
She lives upon the sloping hill,
  That overlooks the lawn.
The lawn, where I shall never more.
  In springtime’s pleasant hours,
Go fourth with her in merry mood,
  To gather wood and flowers.

7. Tell her, when death was on my brow
  And life was ebbing fast
Her voice, her form, her parting words,
  Were with me to the last.
On Richmond’s blood red battle field,
  Tell her I dying lay,
And that I knew she thought of me,
  Some thousand miles away.
