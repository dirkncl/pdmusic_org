1. Three cheers for our Banner, the stripes and the stars, 
The ensign of Liberty’s glorious wars! 
Fling it out, to the breezes, its colors display, 
Let our Standard float, boldly, in face of the day, 
We will stand by this Banner, thro’ fire and flood, 
We will guard and defend it, tho’ crimsom’d with blood.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then, three cheers for our Banner, in peace and in wars, 
We will, ever, be true to the Stripes and the Stars.

2. Three cheers for our Union; the Land of our birth;
’Tis the fortress of Freedom, the hope of the Earth,
Arouse you ye sons of the East and the West,
To defend it, though blood flow, from each gallant breast,
Remember, a noble old poet has said,
’Tis sweet for our Country, to sleep with the dead.

3. The noble young heroes, who rescue her name,
Columbia will crown, with the garland of fame
If they fall, she will weep o’er their glorious scars,
And will lay them to rest, ’neath her Banner of Stars.
We know, that the Seventh, will always be found,
In the van of the host, on the blood redden’d ground.

4. There cheers for Columbia, the queen of the world,
To the winds every quarter, her flag be unfurled,
We have bowed at her feet, in the day of her pride;
Shall we, basely desert her, now, she is defied?
No; millions of voices will instant reply,
For freedom and Country, we’ll dare and we’ll die.
