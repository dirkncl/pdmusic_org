1. Twas on the twelfth of April,
Before the break of day,
We heard the guns of Moultrie,
Give signal for the fray.
Anon across the waters
There boomed the answ’ring gun,
From North and South cam flash on flash,
The battle had begun;
Again to fight for Liberty,
Our Gallant sons had come.
They smiled when came the bugle call,
And laughed when tapp’d the drum.

2. See! yonder, anxious gazing,
Alone a matron stands,
The tear drop glistenning on eash lid
And tightly clasped her hands,
For there exposed to deadly fire
Her husband, and her son,
“Father” she spoke and heaven she looked,
“Fatther! Thy will be done.”
She breathed so hard one thoughtful tear,
Prompt at their country’s call,
They yielded so their dearest hopes,
And die to honor all.

3. All day the shot flew thick and fast
All night the cannon roared
While wreath’d in smoke, stern Soldier stood
And vengeful answer poured.
Now, densest smoke, and lurid flame
Burst out o’er Sumter’s walls.
"The Fort’s on fire,” is the cry,
And soon for aid must call.
See! how he answers gun for gun.
Hurrah! his flag is down.
The white, the white, Oh! see it wave,
Is echoed all around.

4. Now ring the bells a joyous peal,
And send with shouts the air.
We’ve torn the hated banner down
And placed the “Crescent” there.
All honor to ? ? ?
Bring fourth the call of ?
And there in glowing lines inscribe
Each patriot hero’s name.
Spread ? with tidings far and wide
Ye woods take up the cry,
Our words redeemed ? ? ? ?
We’ll keep it pure or die.
