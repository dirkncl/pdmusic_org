1. The Land in which we live, and love, 
  Oh! ’twas a happy Land; 
Before the rebel sword was drawn 
With fratricidal hand 
  And though the earth may run with blood 
In many a well fought field, 
  We’ll strike while yet a man remains, 
For Freemen never yield!

CHORUS 1.
Then raise the starry banner, 
And point it to the sky; 
Though thousands yet may perish, 
The Nation shall not die.

2. The patriots of the earlier time, 
  We never can forget 
The hearts so honest yet sublime, 
  The soil their lifeblood wet. 
The names that were immortal made 
  By many a battle won; 
No never while the fame and fairest 
  Descend from sire to son.

CHORUS 2.
Then up the starray banner, 
And let it proudly fly; 
For while a loyal heart remains, 
The Nation shall not die.

3. The cause for which we speak and fight,—
  Oh! ’tis a holy cause—
It seeks to vindicate the right
  And Freedom’s godlike laws;
And millions yet unborn shall rise
  To bless the glorious band,
Who grappled with the deadly foe,
  To save this loyal land!

CHORUS 3.
Then raise the starry banner, 
And bear it proudly high; 
And let the cry forever be, 
The Nation shall not die.
