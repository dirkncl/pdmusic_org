1. Dixie whipped old Yankee Doodle, 
  early in the morning,
So Yankeedom had best look out, 
  and take a timely warning.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! for our Dixie land,
  Hurrah! for our borders!
Southern boys to arms will stand,
  and whip the dark marauders.

2. Yankee Doodles soundly slept 
  upon their grassy pillows,
While Dixie boys, with muffled oars, 
  were gliding o’er the billows.
