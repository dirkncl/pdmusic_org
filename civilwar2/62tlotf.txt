1. Boys and girls are all for Union, 
  North and South, and East and West;
All the States in loved communion,
  Heart and hand, with Freedom blest.

CHORUS 1-6.
They join in a loud hurrah!
Hurrah for the land of the free!
For Union and Peace, for Freedom and Law!
Hurrah! for the land of the free!

2. We will kove our land forever,
  Dearest land beneath the sun;
Foemen’s steel shall not dissever
  Youthful hearts that now are one.

3. We are all a band of brothers,
  All the States are sisters too;
And in time there will be others
  That shall happy vows renew.

4. We will dwell in love tomorrow,
  As we did in years gone by;
Heart and hand in joy or sorrow,
  While the ages onward fly.

5. Let the hopeful words be spoken,
  On the wings of promise borne:
Never shall the links be broken,
  Never shall the flag be torn.

6. Union now and Union ever!
  Boys and girls for Union all!
We will keep it safe, and never
  Shall our glorious Union fall!
