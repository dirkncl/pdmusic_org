1. Arouse! a traitor band is arming.
Their pirate Banner taints the air;
Our Country call each one alarming
To Freedom’s standard all repair,
To Freedom’s standard all repair,
Lo! spirits from the field so gory,
Where fought and bled our noble sires,
Anew each patriots bosom fires,
As marshalled for the field glory.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The stripes and stars unfurl!
Unsheath the battle blade!
Strike home! strike home! till Freedom’s foes,
Shall low in dust be laid.
Strike home! strike home! till Freedom’s foes,
Shall low in dust be laid.

2. From East to West the tides are meeting.
The North rolls down its giant wave;
All partizans as brothers greeting,
As on they come to die or save,
As on they come to die or save,
And who can stand this dread uprising?
Not traitors base to Freesom’s cause,
False to their vows, false to its laws,
And whom the world knows despising.


3. O glorious day in Freedom’s story,
Her spirit lives unsullied still;
In every heart, the young, the hoary
’Tis bounding with a rapturous thrill,
’Tis bounding with a rapturous thrill,
And shall we fear when thus united,
We battle for our native land,
Against a false and traitor band?
Behold! e’en now they stand affrighted.
