1. Our Flag, our Country, our Union forever
The gift of our fathers
We’ll give it up never!
The home of our WASHINGTON, honored in story,
It constantly crown must be the land of the patriots glory,

CHORUS 1-4.
Huzza! Huzza! our Union forever!
Huzza! Huzza! Our Country and Flag,
Huzza! Huzza! our Union forever,
Huzza! Huzza! our Country and Flag.

2. The Flag of our Union! we’ll rally around it,
And garlands of vic’try shall constantly crown it,
No touch of the foeman, or traitor shall stain it,
We’ll shed the last drop of our blood to sustain it,

3. Our Country, our home, we will honor and cherish
Its freedom maintain, or defending it perish,
Convinced that if Heaven smile on us as ever,
No foeman can conquer nor faction can sever,

4. Our Union! may it be the glory of nations,
Where virtue and freedom, thro’ long generations,
Shall witness the Star Spangled Banner wave o’er us,
With millions to join us in Liberty’s chorus,
