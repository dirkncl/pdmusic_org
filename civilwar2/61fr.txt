CHORUS [sung before each VERSE]
Freemen! Freemen! from mountain, from valley,
Fill our rank, fill our ranks, rally! rally!
The harvest in our fields, unheeded let parch,
Unforl our flag and march! march! march!

1. Nerve ev’ry arm and strike a deadly blow,
And lay in the dust, proud oppressors low,
Rushing at their ranks, scatter far the band,
That dares to enslave, Freesoms chosen Land.

2. O’er mountain, o’er valley loudly beats the drum,
And freemen are shouting, We come! We come!
”Liberty or death,” ev’ry freeman’s cry,
Freemen we have lived, freemen we will die.”

3. The tramping of our feet, echoes back a sound!
Response of our Sires! who sleep’neath this ground;
Strike for their graves, the home of the free,
Which their blood bought and they gave to thee!

4. “The Heaven Starr’d, flag left thee as its heir,
Traitors shall not tarnish, Swear! Freemen! Swear.”
O’er land and o’er sea, Vict’ry it shall bear,
By no stain tarnished, We swear! We swear!

5. Great God of battles! ere we be slaves,
Where the gun rattles, spread thou our graves!
O’er our cold sod, let freedom’s flag fly,
Marking the spot, where we wish to lie!
