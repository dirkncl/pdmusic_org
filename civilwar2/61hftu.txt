1. God’s Right Hand is was that made us,
  Nation, soil, and engine, One;
And while that Right Hand shall aid us,
  Spoil the hallowed work, shall none.

CHORUS 1-6.
God defend the Right— our cry—
Union, Law, and Liberty.

2. Heirs of freedom, could we cower?
  Give the way to traitor rage?
Stand and see a slaveborn power
  Rend our glorious heritage?

3. This we war for— not defiant,
  Not a thirst for vengeful strife,
But in arms of Duty valiant,
  Strike we for the Nation’s Life.

4. Conflict dire— yet Heaven’ probation
  Bracing into one our might;
Strength is born of tribulation;
  Right is sure to come out right.

5. To the Lord of Hosts, Hosanna!
  Pray Him bid the carnarge cease,
Make undimmed our starlit banner,
  Float again o’re realms of peace.

6. Praise Him, praise Him, ever giving,
  First or last, the just award;
Praise Him, praise Him, ever living,
  Our sole King and Sovereign Lord.
