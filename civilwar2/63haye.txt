[On cover: 1st man says]
"How are you Exempt.
I 'spose you are all right,
As the Doctor said you'd never do,
To take your gun and fight."

[On cover: 2nd man says]
you get out

1. “How are you,” Exempt? 
I s’pose you feel “all right,” 
As the Surgeon said you’d never do 
To take your gun and fight. 
What did he say the matter was? 
The trouble man with you? 
Did he say you’d got the heart complaint, 
And test you through and through? 

[REFRAIN and]
CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
“How are you,” Exempt? 
I s’spose you feel “all right,”
As the Surgeon said you’d never do 
To take your gun and fight.

2. “How are you,” Exempt? 
Did he say that that was all? 
Did he say you were too short 
Or too slender or too tall? 
Was your case one of debility. 
Once caused by a fall, 
Did he say you could not see, sire, 
With but one eye at all? 

3. “How are you,” Exempt? 
Tell us what the doctor said. 
Did he say _non-compos-mentis_ 
Which means weakness of the head. 
Or did he say your back and legs 
Were shaped so crookedly 
That you¦ never do to take your gun 
And go along with me?
