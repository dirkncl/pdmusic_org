1. Ye sons of Liberty, arise!
To Freedom’s voice attend 
Columbia call, arise, arise!
The stars and stripes defend.
Ye freemen, leave your shops and lands
And save our banner bright,
Dear Freedom’s Flag, from traitors’ hands!
Arise! in martial might!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ye Sons of Freedom, rise!
On you our hopes depend,
Columbia calls!
Arise! Arise!
The Stars and Stripes defend!

2. Awake from wealth’s retir’d repose!
Awake from peaceful dream!
And swell the mighty tide that flows,
A patriotic stream,
To sweep away the pirate crew,
Who madly would  o’erwhelm
Our pride— the Red. the White and Blue,
And vanquish Freedom’s realm!

3. All ye who love this goodly Land,
The wonder of the West,
Begirded for the rebel band!
Arise and never rest,
Until the grand old Flag shall wave
O’er all Columbia’s plains,
The glory of the true and brave,
Who scorn the tyrants chains!

4. O, for our Father’s memories,
And foe onr country’s weal,
And for the joys of home arise!
Hear Liberty’s appeal!
Bind on the triple panoply
Of patience, courage, will;
And trust in him who reigns on high,
The God of Battles still!
