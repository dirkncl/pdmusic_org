1. Hurrah for the Union, Columbia looks sad, 
She weeps for her children in faction gone mad; 
She trembles, she sickens, nay, never looks blue; 
Her good Constitution will carry her through, 
The UNION arises, she shouts to her sons! 
They rush to her call, and they’ll stand to their guns; 
Since rebellion in arms does our safety beset, 
With resistance to arms, shall the treason be met.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then hurrah for the Union, Columbia looks sad, 
She weeps for her children in faction gone mad. 
She trembles, she sickens— nay, never looks blue, 
Her good Constitution will carry her through!

2. Then up with our Banner, its Stripes and its Stars 
Have floated above us in three gallant wars; 
Its White and its Crimson, its Silver and Blue, 
Show stripes for the traitors, and Stars for the true. 
Then up with our Banner! wherever it flies, 
By earth be it honored, and blest by the skies; 
While the smile that rewards, and the sigh that endears, 
Shall follow the steps of our brave Volunteers.
