1. Clergymen are mustering members of their flocks, 
Satisfied their able to inflict some knocks;
Sounding forth their doctrines, clearing up the mist
From their eyes, their discourse ends— “List! list, oh, list!”

CHORUS 1-6.
Hosts of freemen rushing,
Round the Stripes and Stars,
Gracious wont those southrons
Get their full of war.

2. Editors are gathering and the walls of fame,
Soon will show their children how they carved a name;
Ev’ry inland steamer, Ev’ry train of cars
Bring their eager thousands Going to the wars.

3. Tailors, clerks, nechanics, shoemakers to boot,
Teachers tell their “Ideas,” now’s the time to shoot;
Bronzed and honest farmers Say, we’re bound to jine,
And the hardy fellows fall into line.

4. Students, doctors, lawyers, made a sight sublime,
With the “shoulders hitters” “coming up to time,”
Officers and seamen, salts and jolly tars,
All are now enlisting, going to the wars.

5. Timid, blushing maiden, softly gasps, “my gracious,”
As her gallant lover swears he’ll shoot Jeff Davis;
Proud and doing father, when he says, “my son,”
Hears his roguish youngster, whisper “of a gan.”

6. Gallant looking firemen in their flannel shirts,
Reckon they can handle them “ere Southern squirts;”
Armies from the mountain, armies from the hills,
Armies from the workshops, armies from the mills.
