1.
God and our  Rights!
From ev'ry glen
Come marching ranks of fearless men,
Sons of those who fought and died
On Chalmette's plain, by Jackson's side,
Prompt as their sires to do, to dare.
Their cry as they come is rending the air.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
God and our Rights!
God and our Rights!
God and our Rights!

2.
God and our Rights!
On, Brothers on,
Leave in your fields the ripening corn,
Leave in its burrow the idle plough
For other work's before you now.
Stand to your arms gird on the blade
Cheer­i-ly cry out un-dis-mayed.

3.
God and our Rights!
It was their cry,
When your fathers of old went forth to die,
Right was with them, and God their trust
When the  hirelings of tyranny bit the dust,
They conquered in death and so shall we,
Men of the South, ne'er bend the knee!

4.
Hearts of the South,
Though peace no more
May visit again your sunny shore,
Yield no inch of your dear bought right,
Yield if you yield, a life in the fight,
And as with your feet to the foe you lie,
Let the red field e-cho your last, deep cry.
