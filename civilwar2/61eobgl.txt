1. Don’t shed a tear for him,
Lay him to rest!
The bright cross of honor
A blaze on his breast,
The shouts of a nation
Shall cheer him to God,
The hope of a people
Spring fresh from his blood!

2. Don’t shed a tear for him,
Heroes must die!
In gladness and triumph
Like suns from the sky.
Battle red banners
And wartramp above
They only break camp up
Forward to move!

3. Don’t shed a tear for him,
Mourn him in blood!
Quick dropping bullets
Shall work him most good;
Fight for him, fall for him,
Die as he died!
Living or dying
Our hope and our pride!

4. Don’t shed a tear for him,
Better to go!
Eager for battle,
Facing the foe.
For one life like his life,
A thousand shall pay,
And the fury it kindles
Shall carry the day!
