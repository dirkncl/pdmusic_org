"The Stars and Stripes" (1861)
Words by J. T. F.
Dedicated to
Arthur Little and his Brave Young Comrades.
Music by O. B. Brown.

1.
Rally round the flag, boys,
Give it to the breeze!
That's the banner we love,
On the land and seas.
Brave hearts are under it;
Let the _Traitors_ brag;
Gallant lads, fire away!
And fight for the flag.

CHORUS
Rally roung the flag, boys,
Give it to the breeze!
That's the banner we love,
On the land and seas.

2.
_Their_ flag is but a rag,
Ours is the true one;
Up with the Stars and Stripes!
Down with the new one!
Let our colors fly, boys,
Guard them day and night;
For Victory is Liberty,
And God will bless the Right.

CHORUS
Let our colors fly, boys,
Guard them day and night;
For Victory is Liberty,
And God will bless the Right.
