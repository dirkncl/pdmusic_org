1. Bear on, bear on to victory
Columbia’s gallant flag,
Until from sea to sea it waves,
O’er vale and mountain crag;
Until its ample folds shall be,
Throughout the land unfurled,
The banner which our fathers gave,
To freedom and the world.
  The banner which our fathers gave,
  To freedom and the world.

2. On Carolina’s fertile shore
Once more it proudly waves,
And where the shining Tennessee,
Its winding margin laves,
The people flock rejoiced to see,
Its folds again unfurled,
The banner which our fathers gave,
To freedom and the world.
  The banner which our fathers gave,
  To freedom and the world.

3. Oh! bear it on to victory,
And bear it on to peace,
For loving not the strife of war,
We long to have it cease,
And waving in its pride again,
With long and loud huzzas,
We’ll greet the sons of vicrory,
And glorious stripes and stars.
  We’ll greet the sons of victory,
  And glorious stripes and stars.
