1. Sons! of this your fatherland.
Bear your starry banner high.
Swear by each uplifted hand.
Liberty shall never die.
Never till you sleep in death,
Never till your hearts are cold.
Shall a single traitor’s breath,
Stain the honor of a fold!

CHORUS 1-4.
O! save the flag of Washington,
God bless its heroes, sire and son;
Who in its folds enwrapt and blent,
Prayed as their souls to heaven went
God save our native land
God save our native land.

2. Freemen! by the vows you sign.
By the life so dear to you.
All the glory shall be thine.
Save the old Red, White and Blue!
When you see her comong foe,
When you hear her piercing cry.
Freemen! then your valor show.
Strike for Liberty or die!

3. See in yonder curling breeze
What your fathers gave to you!
We’re there ever men like these?
Sons! O, to their gift be true.
True as magnets to the pole,
True as heaven’s shining sun;
Keep it ever free and whole
Save the flag of Washington!

4. Let the joyful poems rise.
Freedom yet shall rule the storm.
Dropt immortal from the skies.
No decay shall waste her form!
When the earth removes her pall,
When the deep sea yields its gain.
God will still be over all.
Liberty will still remain!
