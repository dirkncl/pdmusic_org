1. Columbia! our country forever!
The home of the true and brave,
More proudly in beauty than ever
Thy Starspangled banner shall wave.
Inscribed on the pages of story,
The record of ages shall be,

REFRAIN 1
Thy Banner is covered with glory,
When borne by the sons of the free.
Thy Banner is covered with glory,
When borne by the sons of the free.

CHORUS 1
When borne by the sons of the free.
Thy Banner is covered with glory
When borne by the sons of the free.
Thy Banner is covered with glory


2. Columbia! our country forever!
Thy freemen are honored and brave,
Thy progress is onward, and ever
In triumph o’er tyranny’s grave.
As long as we live, we will cherish
The blessings of freedom and thee,

REFRAIN 2
Or guarding our liberty, perish—
Defending the homes of the Free!
Or guarding our liberty, perish—
Defending the homes of the Free!

CHORUS 2
Or guarding our liberty, perish—
Defending the homes of the Free!
Or guarding our liberty, perish—
Defending the homes of the Free!

3. Columbia! our country forever!
Thy starspangled banner shall wave
The pride of thy sons who will never
Surrender the land of the brave.
With generous and noble devotion,
We’ll rally for Freedom and Thee

REFRAIN 3
And united from Ocean to Ocean,
Sustain the loved Flag of the Free.
And united from Ocean to Ocean,
Sustain the loved Flag of the Free.

CHORUS 3
And united from Ocean to Ocean,
Sustain the loved Flag of the Free.
And united from Ocean to Ocean,
Sustain the loved Flag of the Free.
