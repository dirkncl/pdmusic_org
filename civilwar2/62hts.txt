1. Hark! the signal sounds, my brothers,
And it shall not call in vain;
On the fields where fought our fathers,
We, their sons, must fight again!
On the host that now assembles,
Hzngs the fate of half the world,
And the awful balance trembles,
And the dice of war are hurl’d!

CHORUS 1-2.
Steady, boys, steady, the battle cloud’s o’er us;
Shoulder to shoulder, we’ll drive them before us!
Strike for the Union, and strike for the Flag!
Strike for the Union, and strike for the Flag!

2. Yonder, see, the trait’rous banner!
Shall it longer shame our sky?
We’ll maintain our Country’s honor,
Or for her with honor die!
Forward, boys! the drums are beating,
And the Starry Standard waves,—
On the Freedom! no retreating!
Freemen born can ne’er be slaves!
