1. ’Mid her ruins proudly stands,
Our Carolina,
Fetters are upon her hands,
Dear Carolina!
Yet she feels no sense of shame,
For upon the scroll of Fame,
She hath writ a deathless name,
Brave Carolina!

2. She was first our wrongs to feel,
Our Carolina,
First to draw the glitt’ring steel,
Dear Carolina!
Ready first to strike the blow,
At th’opressor and the foe,
And to lay their standard low,
Brave Carolina!

3. Nobly now she hears here wrongs,
Our Carolina,
In her night she still hath songs,
Dear Carolina!
In the dust her sons lie low,
Yet tho’ stricken by the foe,
Pride is mingled with her woe,
Brave Carolina!
