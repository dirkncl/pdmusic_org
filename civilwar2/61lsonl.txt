[1] SOLO, then CHORUS
Lord, save our native land, 
Let it still proudly stand 
First ’monst the free;

SOLO, then CHORUS
By thine almighty pow’r, 
Defend us in this hour, 
When threat’ning discords low’r, 
We trust in thee.

[2] SOLO, then CHORUS
Lord, in thy strength arise, 
Cast down our enemies, 
Let them not stand.

SOLO, then CHORUS
Dispel the fearful blight, 
Observing freedom’s light, 
Protect us by thy might, 
Lord, save our Land.
