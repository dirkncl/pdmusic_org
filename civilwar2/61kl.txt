1. Ooh, girls dear, did you ever hear, I wrote my love a letter,
And altho’ he cannot read, sure I thought t’was all the better.
For why should he be puzzled with hard spelling in the matter,
When the meaning was so plain that I love him faithfully,

CHORUS [sung after VERSEs 1-3]
I love him faithfully, I love him faithfully.
And he knows it, oh! he knows it, without one word from me.

2. I wrote it, and I folded it, and put a seal upon it;
’Twas a seal almost as big, as the crown of my best bonnet;
For I would not have the Postmaster make his remarks upon it,
As I’d said inside the letter, that I lov’d him faithfully.

3. My heart was full but when I wrote, I dar’d not put the half in.
The neighbors know I love him, and they’re mighty fond of chaffing;
So I dar’d not write his name outside for fear they would be laughing,
So I wrote “from little Kate to one whom she loves faithfully.”

4. Now girls, would you believe it, that Postman so consated
No answer will he bring me, so long as I have waited;
But mabe there may’nt be one, for the rason that I stated,
That my love can neither read nor write, but he loves me faithfully.

CHORUS (for VERSE 4]
He loves me faithfully. He love me faithfully;
And I know where’er my love is, that he is true to me.
