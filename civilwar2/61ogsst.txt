1. Our good ship sails tonight, Mary,
And I must haste away,—
I see the banner waving,
Out in the little bay;
Long, long I may be absent
Upon the deep blue sea,
But when I’m gone away, Love,
Still, still remember me.
  But when I’m gone away, Love,
  Still, still remember me.

2. My heart will e’er be true, Mary,
Unto our early vow,
And tho’ the ocean rolls between,
’Twill beat as warm as now;
This little token I will keep,
Whate’er my fate may be,
I’ll wear it near my heart, Love,
A priceles gift from thee!
  I’ll wear it near my heart, Love,
  A priceles gift from thee!

3. I cannot linger now, Mary,
The shades of ev’ning fall,—
The boat is waiting by the beach,
I hear the wellworn call;
Then faretheewell, my darling one,
My home is on the sea,
Yet should my life be spared, Love,
I’ll come again to thee!
  Yet should my life be spared, Love,
  I’ll come again to thee.
