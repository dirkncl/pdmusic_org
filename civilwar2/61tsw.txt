1. What shall the Southron’s watchword be,
Fighting for us on the land and sea?
Bearing our flag o’er the billows’ foam?
Shedding his blood for his Southern home?
To bleed and conquer he’s bravely gone;
Freedom and glory still urge him on;

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then shall the Southron’s watchword be,
The grave of a Hero or Victory!
Victory! Victory!
The grave of a Hero or Victory!
Victory! Victory!
The grave of a Hero or Victory!

2. What shall the Southron’s watchword be,
Bearing the banner that proves him free?
Bravely he dashes amid the strife,
For home and country, for child and wife;
His aims  are bright and his hopes are high;
His brave resolve in to do or die; 

3. What shall the Southron’s watchword be,
Fighting the battles of Liberty?
Holy the light on his manly brow,
The victor’s wreath or the cypress bough!
Such are the thoughts which the brave inspire,
Filing their souls with the soldier’s fire;
