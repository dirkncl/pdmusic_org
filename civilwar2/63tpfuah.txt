"They Pray For Us At Home" (1863)
Song and Chorus

On Sunday, the day after the battle of Cedar Mountain, as our
wounded Soldiers were lying in a Church, at Culpepper, which
had been taken for a Hospital; one of the mortally wounded,
whispered to a dying Companion "I wish there was some one here
to pray for us!" to which his Companion replied, "THERE ARE
PRAYING FOR US AT HOME!"

1. Oh would there were some kind one, who on this sabbath day,
Would breathe one prayer to cheer us as our spirits pass away,
If there only were some loved one to grasp us by the hand,
And whisper words of comfort as we leave this earthly strand.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
They pray for us at home,
At morning’s early light,
They pray for us at noon,
And in the silent night.

2. I feel that life is fleeting, I hear the fearful roar,
Of the tide that soon will bear us out from life’s receding shore,
But I could go ne’er fearing, free from all doubt and care,
If some dear one would offer up for me a parting prayer.

3. It was our country called us, we answered to the call,
We left our wives and children dear, to conquer or to fall,
And now that death is near us, why need we fear its gloom?
For we shall wake victorious beyond the silent tomb.
