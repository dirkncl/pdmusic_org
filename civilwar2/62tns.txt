1.
I'll sing you now de last new song
I heard down in Secessia;
I'll change de words a little mite,
And hope dey wont distress you
Twas Gen'ral Price fus' pitch'd de tune
"Old Ben" struck in sonorous
While Floyd and Polk took up de strain
And all jined in de chorus.

CHORUS
We hear it by night we hear it by day
On foot or in de saddle;
Dey used to sing de Dixie song
But now, "Skedaddle" "Skedaddle."

2.
De rebels dey am husky boys
Quite fond of tune and rhyme, sah
Dey sing dis one to double quick,
While toes and heels keep time, sah,
De darkeys too dey lub to sing,
And so be in de fashion
De way dey promulgate dis ting
Skedaddle am a passion.

(CHORUS)

3.
Secesh and contrabands unite
Like brodders all before us
Dough one go souf de oder norf
Tis all to dis same chorus.
De locomotives cotch de tune
De steamboat as dey paddle;
And keep dar wheels a goin round
To dis same tune Skedaddle.

(CHORUS)

4.
Jeff Davis wants to learn de song,
De Richmond papers tell us
But dar's no music in his soul
I know dey're try'n to sell us.
Den darkeys run, and darkeys sing
"Skedaddle" am de chorus
We'll nebber fear, but always keep
De norf star right before us.

(CHORUS)
