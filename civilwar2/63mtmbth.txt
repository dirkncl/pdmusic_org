1. Slowly ’long the crowded street, 
Came a woman bent and old. 
Reeling thro’ the blinding sleet, 
Almost perished with the cold, 
Tott’ring feebly on her way 
Thro’ the tempest fiercs and wild 
Till there’s like a sunny ray, 
Came a little artless child.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Mama, take me by the hand. 
You are weary, do not weep.
(weep, dear mother,) 
Mama darling take my hand, 
And I will lead you home to sleep. 
(yes home to sleep.)

2. Crowded by the bustling throng, 
Not a friend on either side 
Wearily she trudged along, 
With the little one for guide. 
Pausing in each open door 
To excape the tempest wild 
Still above the storms fierce roar, 
Came the pleading of the child,

3. Where the snow had drifted deep, 
On the outskirts of the town 
Heavy tired, needing sleep, 
Child and mother laid them down. 
When the dawn broke thro’ the clouds 
And the sunlight came again 
Angel-forms o’er icy shrouds, 
Sang again the plaintive ’strain.
