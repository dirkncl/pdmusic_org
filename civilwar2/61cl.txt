1.
States of the South! Confederate Land!
  Our for has come, the hour is nigh;
His balefires glare on every hand
  Rise as one man to do or die!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Up! old and young, the weak, the strong;
  Rise for the Right hurl back the wrong;
And foot to foot, and brand to brand,
  Strike! for our own Confederate Land!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Up! old and young, the weak, the strong,
  Rise for the Right hurl back the wrong;
And foot to foot, and brand to brand
  Strike for our own Confederate Land!

2.
From mountain, vale, and prairie wide,
  From forest vast, and field, and glen,
And crowded city, poor thy tide,
  Oh! fervid South! of patriot men.

3.
Arm'd or unarm'd, stand fearless forth,
  Sons of the South! stand, wife and maid!
Against the foul insidious North
  Our babes shall wield the battle blade.

4.
Oh! though perennial be the strife,
  For honor dear, for hearth stone fire;
Give blow for blow! take life for life,
  "Strike! till the last arm'd foe expire,"
