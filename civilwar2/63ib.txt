   The words of this song were suggested by the following incident:
Samuel B. Spinning, of Bridgeport, Conn., an officer of the 2nd Conn.
Battery, while in the service of his Country at Wolf run shoals, Va. in
the spring of 1863, became totally blind.

1. They tell me that the spring has come,
That springflow’rs blosom now;
The woods now wear their em’rald sheen,
And vernal breezes blow.
I feel its warn breath on my cheek,
I hear the voices kind
Of friends I never more may see— 
I’m blind, I’m blind.

2. The skies which once were bright to me,
With many a glit’ring light,
Have veil’d alas, their azure hues
In clouds of darkest night
I hear the tempest in its wrath,
I hear the hollow wind,
I cannot mark the lightning’s flash—
  I’m blind, I’m blind.

3. I hear the drum at morn and eve,
I hear the trumpet’s sound,
I hear the war horse’ clat’ring hoof,
The sentry pace his round:
My fancy sees the tented field,
The flag I left behind,
I see no more its starry folds—
  I’m blind, I’m blind.

4. But why repine at Fate’s decree,
Why murmur at His will,
When touches with a chast’ning rod,
His promise to fulfil.
Then will I turn me to my God,
Whose ways are ever kind;
He never will forsake me, though
  I’m blind, I’m blind.
