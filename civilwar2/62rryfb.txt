1. Rally round your flag hoys! 
Rally rally strong, 
Hip hip hip hurah boys! 
Cheer it loud and long. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Three cheers for the Union, and flag of the free, 
The ensign which gives to all men liberty.

QUARTETTE [sung after each CHORUS]
Three cheers for the Union, and flag of the free 
The ensign which gives to all men liberty.

2. March on, march on brave boys!
Quickly quickly forth,
Surely then you’ll find boys,
Victory is yours.

3. Rifles must by sure boys!
Bayonets must by bright,
Steady hands and minds boys,
Footsteps quick and light.

4. Courage must by firm boys,
Hearts must waver not,
A good sense is yours boys,
Fathers for it fought.

5. On then bear your flag boys;
Proudly let it soar,
O’er each rebel state boys,
Rebel states no more.
