CHORUS [sung before each VERSE]
Free as our eagle spreads his wing,
Our banner to the breeze we fling,
Millions of freemen warriors brave,
Third flag will keep, defend, and save.

1. Freemen join the glorious anthem,
  Let each heart with joy beat high,
Sound it far o’er rock and mountain,
  Till the echoes give reply,
Land by Heaven most highly favored,
  Freedom’s sons still watch o’er thee,
And would like their pilgrim fathers,
  Gladly die for Liberty.

2. Land where Freedom’s starry banner,
  Flings its folds o’er every sea,
Proudly waves o’er town and hamlet,
  Emblem of the brave and free,
May that banner ever honored,
  Still float proudly far and near,
Let it tell the patriots triumphs,
  Let it drape the soldiers bier.

3. O Thou God of every nation,
  Bless Thou this our native land,
And her sons, O give them firmness,
  Ever for the right to stand,
And if threatening clouds should gather,
  Guard and guide them in thy way,
Till the Star of Peace arises,
  Heralding a brighter day.
