1. Weep not, brave one for your Mother,
  For the battle is not lost,
And the cause for which you’re dying,
  Will repay her all the cost.
God is with her though you are not,
  He will soothe her throbbing brow,
And throughout the coming future,
  He will care for Mother now.
And throughout the coming future,
  He will care for Mother now.

2. When the stars are fondly smiling,
  On the hillock where you lie,
She will smile to think how nobly,
  You could for your country die.
When the fragrant clover blossoms,
  O’er your grave in pity bow,
Loyal hearts will gather round her,
  They will care for Mother now.
Loyal hearts will gather round her,
  They will care for Mother now.

3. From the home to which you hasten
  Loving spirits will descend,
And your own among the number,
  Will be found her dearest friend.
Holy hands will smooth her pillow,
  Strew with flowers her path, I trow;
God, and man, and angels vieing,
  All will care for Mother now.
God, and man, and angels vieing,
  All will care for Mother now.
