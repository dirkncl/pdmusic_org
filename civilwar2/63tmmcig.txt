1. I am writing to you, mother, knowing well what you will say 
When you read with tearful fondness, what I write to you today; 
Knowing too the flame of ardor on each loyal mother’s part 
That will kindle with each impulse, with each throbbing of your heart.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O! mother, O! mother, O! mother, can  I go? 
I am eager, anxious, longing, tell me, mother, Can I go?
Can I go? can I go? O! mother, can I go? 

2. I am young and slender, mother, they would call me yet a boy,
But I know the land I live in, and the blessings I enjoy;
I am old enough, my mother, to be loyal, proud, and true
To the faithful sense of party I have ever learned from you.

3. I have written to you, mother, with a conscience of right,—
I am thinking of you fondly, with a loyal heart tonight;
When I have your noble bidding, which shall tell me to press on,
I will come and kiss you, mother, come and kiss you, and be gone.

4. We must conquer this rebellion; let the doubting heart be still;
We must conquer it or perish— we must conquer and we will!
But the faithful must not falter, and shall I be wanting? No!
Bid me go, my dearest mother, tell me, mother, can I go?
