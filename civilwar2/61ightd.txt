  Owing to the altogether unprecedented sale of Mr. Emmmett's
song "I wish I was in Dixies Land," the publishers have
induced him to write the words and compose the music of the
above song, as a sequel to "Dixies Land."
  As many inquiries have been made in regard to the meaning of
"Dixies Land" and as to the location, it may be well to remark,
that with the southern negroes, Dixies Land is but another
name for Home. Hence it is but fair to conclude, that all
south of the Mason's & Dixon's Line is the true "Dixies Land."

1.
There is a land where cotton grows,
A land where milk and honey flows,
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.

Chorus
I've got no time to tarry, I've got no time to stay,
'Tis a rocky road to travel, to Dixie far away.
I've got no time to tarry, I've got no time to stay,
'Tis a rocky road to travel, to Dixie far away.

2.
I will climb up the highest hill,
And sing your praise with right good will.
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)

3.
I've wander'd far, both to and fro'
But Dixie's heaven here below.
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)

4.
O list to what I've got to say,
Freedom to me will never pay!
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)

5.
A shadow and a phantom frail,
The mighty truth it must prevail!
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)

6.
In Dixie Land the fields do bloom
And color'd men have welcome room.
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)

7.
I will proclaim it loud and long.
I love old Dixie right or wrong.
I'm going home to Dixie; Yes; I am going home.
(Chorus)
