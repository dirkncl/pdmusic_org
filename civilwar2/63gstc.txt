1. Sons of Columbia, rejoice
That ye in Freedom dwell,
That ye in Freedom dewll!
Triumphantly let ev’ry voice
The nation’s anthem swell:

CHORUS 1
The Freeman’s home from shore to shore—
God save the country evermore!
The Freeman’s home from shore to shore—
God save the country evermore!

2. Thus speaks a nation in its might:
Nor crown nor tyrant rod,
Nor crown nor trrant rod,
But Liberty and Human Right,
Rule by the Grace of God!

CHORUS 2
Rule by His Grace whom we implore:
God save the country evermore!
Rule by His Grace whom we implore:
God save the country evermore!

3. Hail to the heroes and the slain,
Who our redemption sped,
Who our redemption sped;
O let for ever fresh remain
The laurels of our dead!

CHORUS 3
The laurels pluck’d in fields of gore:
God save the country evermore!
The laurels pluck’d in fields of gore:
God save the country evermore!

4. And will you by your country stand,
And heed its ev’ry call!
And heed its ev’ry call!
Lay on a loyal heart your hand,
And pledge your country all!

CHORUS 4
We pledge— as did our sires before:
God save the country evermore!
We pledge— as did our sires before:
God save the country evermore!

5. Hurrah! the Red, White, Blue unfold!
Which guards the Freeman’s cause,
Which guards the Freemam’s cause,
And ’neath that starry flag uphold
The Union and the laws!

CHORUS 5
Thro¦ cannon flash and battle roar
God save the country evermore!
Thro’ cannon flash and batrle roar
God save the country evermore!
