1. Men of thought be up and stirring,
  Night and day,
Sow the seed withdraw the curtain,
  Clear the way,
Men of action aid and cheer them
  While you may,
There a fount begins to team,
There a light begins to beam,
There a warmpth begins to glow,
There a flow’r begins to blow,
There a midnight darkness
  Changing into day
Men of tthought and men of action
  Clear the way.

2. When the welcome night is breaking
  Who shall say,
What the unimaginged gloriees
  Of the day
What the evil that shall perish
  On its ray.
Aid the speaking tongue and pen,
Aid it hopes of honest men,
Aid it paper— aid it type
Aid it for the hour is ripe,
And our earnest must not
  Shaken into play
Men of thought, and men of action,
  Clear the way.

3. Lo the nights about to vanish
  From the day,
And a brazen wrong to crumble
  Into clay.
Lo the rights about to conquor
  Clear the way.
With the right shall many
Enter smiling at the door,
With the giant wrong shall fall
Many others great and small,
Which for ages long have held us
  On their sway,
Men of thought, and men of action
  Clear the way.
