1. 'Twas in the early springtime,
When the doves begin to coo,
I walk’d across the valley,
Sweet Jenny Brown to woo.
My path lay through the orchard,
Whose sweetness fill’d the air,
And ere I half had pass’d it,
I met sweet Jenny there.

CHORUS 1­-4. 
Ah, yes! ’twas in the springtime,
When the doves begin to coo,
I walk’d across the valley,
Sweet Jenny Brown to woo. 

2. The apple boughs were laden
With blossoms budding low;
And the wither’d leaves were falling,
Like flakes of scented snow.
I told my love to Jenny,
I scarce remember how;
But she seem’d to understand me,
As she heard my trembling vow.

3. And she smil’d a little archly
As she took a ribbon blue,
And bent a twig down gently
And bound it firm and true:
And she said, “When on this branchlet,
With ribbon I have tied,
Hangs an apple ripe and rosy,
Jenny Brown will be your bride.”

4. And through the long glad summer
We watch’d that token true,
As it brighten’d in the sunshine,
Or glisten’d in the dew;
And of all the lads and lasses
That saw it, passing by,
Not one could read its promise
But Jenny Brown and I.

5. At length the happy Autumn
Came smiling o’er the land,
Its golden treasures flinging
With free and bounteous hand;
And when with rip’ning fruitage
The apple boughs were red,
I walk’d across the valley,
Sweet Jenny Brown to wed.

CHORUS 5.
Ah, yes! ’twas in the Autumn,
When the apple boughs were red,
I walk’d across the valley,
Sweet Jenny Brown to wed.
