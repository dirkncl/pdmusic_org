1. On Freedom’s Altar glowa a fire,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
Which burns and never shall expire.
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
The traitors have the war begun,
But we’re for UNION to a man;
And ever fight in Freedom’s van,
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

2. The Keystone State is hallowed ground,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
Here INDEPENDENCE HALL is found,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
We’ll leave our workshops, forges— all,
And answer to our Country’s call,
Which bids us on base traiters fall!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

3. Our trust is on our righteous cause,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
Our Constitution and our laws,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
Where’er our Flag is floating high,
We’ll march to death or victory,
And freemen evermore be free!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

4. Then quick respond to war’s appeal,
To arms! To arms! To arms!
Ye men with hearts as true as steel,
To arms! To arms! To arms!
Our glorious UNION let us SAVE!
Once more our FLAG o’er SUMTER wave,
And treason find an early grave!
To arms! To arms! To arms!
