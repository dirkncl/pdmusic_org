1.
I’m thinking of a flower,
I pluck’d when quite a child
From out a beauteous bower,
Bedewed with heaven’s bright smile.
The richness of its fragrance
Diffused itself around,
Looked up in sweet simplicity,
And wept beneath my frown,
The fragrant breath that flower bore,
I never shall forget,
As gazing on its modest blue
I whispered softly Violet.

2.
I chershed it with pleasure,
I watered it with tears,
It was my dearest treasure,
The blossom of my years,
And when the icy hand of death,
Is on my bosom set,
I’ll then resign my spirit wealth,
Unto that sweet blue Violet,
And may its beauty be preserved
By cool and grateful showers,
And ever ripe within my heart,
The virgin queen of flowers.
