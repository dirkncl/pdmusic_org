1.
I come up Norf, on a little bender,
Left Missus at home wid no one to tend her,
Ole Massa's gone, I dunno whar to;
Sambo pretty sure he don't much care to.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[Soprano]
Den sound de horn,
[Alto, Tenor and Bass]
Sound de horn,
[Soprano]
beat de drum,
[Alto, Tenor and Bass]
beat de drum,
[SATB]
Sound de horn and beat de drum,
De year ob jubilee am come.
 Sound de horn and beat de drum,
 De year ob jubilee am come.

2.
Met Genral Bloaregard, on my way here,
He told me dat I had better stay dere;
He said, up Norf, dey would skin and eat me,
Dat was a yarn dat a little beat me.

3.
He said he had just whipp'd Genral Buel,
Grant and Wallce, all three in a duel,
I axed him den, why he was running away?
Sambo, says he, dat question aint fair play.

4.
Oh, times down South am getting quite rotten,
De's so berry scarce, they have to burn cotten,
I left dat land ob oppression and gas,
And roam de free Norf without nary pass.

5.
Molasses Junction was a big scarecrow,
Night its wooden guns nobody didn't dare go,
But when McClellan a good ready,
De Southern Gentry seemed quite unsteady.

6.
Abraham Lincoln and Emancipation,
De two tallest tings in dis tall nation,
Hurrah den boys, let us still be merry,
Kingdom has come, boys, we've good times berry.
