1.
Oh, Father dear, the storm is raging,
  Cold and damp the night mist falls,
Some helpless crew a prey to danger,
  For help, for help, despairing calls!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Thim the lamp,
The boat launch quickly, the boat launch quickly,
Tho' danger threatens, the worst we'll brave,
The toil heed not, if we but rescue
The shipwreck'd wander's from the grave.

2.
My child, it would be worse than madness
  To tempt the waves this fearful night;
To sleep, to rest, again betake your--
  Await, await the morning light.

3.
I cannont sleep, their shrieks appall me;
  Oh, heard you not that fearful cry?
Afar I see the day is breaking,--
  Look out, look out, the wreck I spy!

4.
The boat is launched 'mid billows breaking--
  Like some wild bird that frail boat flew;
The gentle girl with love unshaken
  Has saved the hapless shipwrecked crew.

5.
The gentle Grace,-- so young and lovely--
  No silent joy her* heart betrays,--
Though grateful tears are round her falling,
  And hearts are beating to her praise.

*Grace Darling
