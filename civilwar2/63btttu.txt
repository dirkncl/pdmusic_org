1. Be true to the Union, forever be true,
And spurn with contempt all her foes;
Be true to the Union, forever be true,
And none of her laws e’er oppose. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Be true to the Union— forever be true,
To the land of the free and the brave,
Leave the homes that you love, bid your friends all adieu,
And go forth the Union to save.

2. Be true to the land which your forefathers bought,
With their lives, that you might enjoy,
The blessing of freedom, the blesing they sought,
Foul treason shal never destroy.
