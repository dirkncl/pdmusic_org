1.
Our nation’s banner streams upon the wind,
The harbinger of hope to all mankind!
The welkin’s hues were blended in its dies,
And all its stars were kindled in the skies.
It waves in triumph over land and sea:
Our Father’s boon— the symbol of the free!
Vain is the strife that would its glory dim
While it reminds his countrymen of Him.

2.
He who was first in war and first in peace,
First in our hearts will be till time shall cease,
With the deathnews of his devoted band,
Baptised the banner of his ransomed land!
Preserve it, freemen, to your latest breath,
And keep the watchword, “Liberty or death!”
Our FATHER spake: “In trust that flag is given:”
Its stars are the forgetmenots of heaven.
