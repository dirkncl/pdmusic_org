1. “Care for them tenderly,”
Send back our dead,
Who for their country’s cause,
Nobly have bled.
Send us our lov’d ones,
Who in Spring’s bloom
“First on the battle field,”
First found their tomb.

2. “Care for them tenderly,”
Smooth from each brow
Hair, o’er which loving hands
Cannot pass now.
Straighten each manly form,
Close the dark eyes,
Clothe them in robes of white
Fit for the skies.

3. “Care for them tenderly,”
And as they come,
Lower their much lov’d flag,
Muffle the drum.
Send up your pray’rs for them.
Let tear drops fall,
Scatter fresh laurel leaves
Meet for their tomb.

4. “Care for them tenderly,”
Then shall be given,
Mute thanks from broken hearts
Blessings from heaven.
Mercies unnumber’d
Shall rest on the head
Of those who shall tenderly
Care for the dead.
