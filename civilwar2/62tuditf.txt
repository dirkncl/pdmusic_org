1. I know that the world, the great big world
From the Peasant up to the King,
Has a different tale that the tale I tell,
And a different song to sing;

2. But for me and I care not a single fig
If they say I am wrong or am right.
I shall always go in for the weaker dog
For the under dog in the fight.

3. I know that the world, the great big world
Will never for a moment stop,
To see which dog, may be in the fault
But will shout for the dog on top.

4. But for me and I never shall pause to ask
Which dog may be in the right.
For my heart will beat while it beats at all
For the under dog in the fight.

5. Perchance I have said what I’d better not said,
Or t’were better that I’d said it incog;
But with heart and glass, chock full to the brim,
Here’s a health to the bottom dog.
