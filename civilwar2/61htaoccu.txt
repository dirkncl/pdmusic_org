1. Hark! To arms! our Country’s calling!
Treason strikes, our Brothers falling!
Mill and Workshop, cease your rattle,
Send your working hosts to battle!

CHORUS (2x) 1-5.
Hark! To arms! our Country calls us!
Dangers rouse, but naught appals us.
Northern blades, and northern mettle
Test them, traitors! now we settle!

2. Tradesmen, close your doors and speed you
To the field, your brothers need you!
Herdsmen, leave your flocks and cattle,
Arm and hurry to the battle!

3. Young men, lithe and strong we want you;
Quail, and age and cripples taunt you!
Seize the golden moments flying;
Meet your duty, living— dying!

4. Women true, no tears or sighing!
Ease and luxuries denying!
Loving words and Spartan valor,
Not a lip or cheek of pallor!

5. East and West, they shout “We’re ready”!
On the columns, firm and steady!
True as were our Sires before us,
Marching steady to the chorus—
