1. The Freeman rallied, he rush’d to the strife,
  Where the cut and stab and the shot were rife;
Last unction of blood, he spread o’er the soil,
  Sacred to the free, which traitors dar’d spoil.
With thoughts of love, for those forlorn,
  In FatherHome where he was born,
His soul be pour’d in the fading sky,
  His flag on high, cheer’d his dying eye.

2. The Heaven Starr’d Flag, Ensign of the Free!
  In Freedom’s land, droops mournfully;
In Death’s last sleep, the noble and brave,
  Silent repose in their gory grave;
Like “Star in the East,” Heaven! send thy token
  How Tyrant ranks may yet be broken;
In Freemen’s graves, we’d rest together,
  If Freedom’s Hope be crush’d forever.
