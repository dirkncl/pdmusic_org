1. When war and civil strife aroused the battle cry, 
And sons of freemen flew to arms, to conquer or to die;
The words were UNION! NEAR and FAR, 
Unfurl our flag so free!
Erase no star, for in this war 
We strike for liberty.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then ’mid the battle strife, 
Join in with heart and hand, 
The thrilling cry, as dear as life, 
God! and our native land.

2. Rejoice O son of toil, on land or on the sea, 
In distan clime, on foreign soil, our battle is for thee, 
To tyranny we ne’er will yield, 
For man’s birthright we try 
The battle, and the gory field, 
To conquer or to die.

3. Our navy on the sea, our army on the land, 
To dispots show our RIGHT and MIGHT, for  we are FREEDOM’S BAND!
Then strike the drum, the banners wave 
To lead our warriors on To vic’ty, or the hero’s grave, 
Beside great WASHINGTON’S band.
