1. Nobly our flag flutters o’er us today—
Emblem of peace, Pledge of Libertys’s sway—
Its foe shall tremble and shring in dismay
If e’er insulted it be!
Our “stripes and stars” lov’d and honor’d by all
Shall float forever where freedom may call,
It still shall be the flag of the free,
Emblem of sweet Liberty.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Here we will gather its cause to defend
Let patriots rally and wise counsels lend
It still shall be the flag of the free—
Emblem of sweet Liberty!

2. With it in beauty no flag can compare—
All nations honor our banner so fair—
If to insult it, a traitor should dare
Crushed to the earth let him be!
“Freedom and Progress,” our watchword today—
When duty calls us, who dares disobey?
Honor to thee, thou flag of the freee,
Emblem of sweet Liberty.
