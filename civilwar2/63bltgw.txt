1. Breathe low thou gentle wind,
Breathe soft and low;
The beautiful lies dead!
The joy of life is fled!
And my lone heart is wed.
Henceforth to woe!
Henceforth to woe.
Breathe low thou gentle wind.
Breathe soft and low.

2. That thou should’st droop and die
As early morn?
Wnile yet the graceful dew,
A joyous fragrace drew,
From ev’ry flow’r that grew
Life’s path along!
Life’s path along!
Breathe low thou gentle wind,
Breathe soft and low.

3. The green earth mourns for thee,
Thou dearest one:
A plaintive tone is heard,
And flow’r and leaflet stirred,
And ev’ry fav’rite bird
Sings sad and lone,
Sings sad and lone.
Breahe low thou gentle wind,
Breathe soft and low.
