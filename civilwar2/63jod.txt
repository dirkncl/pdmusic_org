1. Had not the Lord, may Israel say,
On Israel’s side engaged,
The foe had quickly swallow’d us,
So furiously he raged,
So furiously he raged.
Had not the Lord Himself vouchsafed,
To check His fierce control,
The adversary’s dreary flood
Had overwhelm’d our soul.

2. But praised be our eternal Lord,
Who left us not his prey;
The snare is broke, his rage disarm’d.
And we again are free,
And we again are free.
Secure in God’s almighty name
One confidence remains;
The God Who made both heaven and earth,
Of both sole monarch reigns.
