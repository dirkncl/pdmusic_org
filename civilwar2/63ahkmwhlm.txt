1. Ah he kissed me, when he left me, 
And he told me to be brave, 
“For I go,” he whispered “darling, 
All that’s dear on earth to save.” 
“For I go,” he whispered “darling. 
All that’s dear on earth to save.” 
So I stifled down the sobbing, 
And I listened with a smile; 
For I knew his country called him, 
Tho’ my heart should break the while.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ah he kissed me, when he left me 
And his parting words remain Deep 
Treasured deep within my this bosom
“Dearest, we shall meet again.”

2. O the sun still shines as brightly, 
And the world looks just as gay, 
As upon the fatal morning, 
That which bore my love away. 
As upon the fatal morning, 
That which bore my love away. 
Now alast the dust is resting, 
On the bold and manly brow; 
And the heart that beat so proudly, 
Lieth still and quiet now.

3. Yes, he fell; his clear voice ringing 
Loud, to cheer his comrades on; 
But how much of joy and sunshine, 
Is with him forever gone? 
But how much of joy and sunshine, 
Is with him forever gone? 
Where now the pine tree rustles, 
And the Southern branches wave; 
There my own true love is lying, 
Low within a soldier’s grave.
