1. Rally round the flag, boys, 
Give it to the breeze, 
That’s the banner we love, 
On the land and seas.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse] 
Brave hearts are under ours, 
Let the traitors brag, 
Gallant lads, fire away! 
And fight for the flag! 
Gallant lads, fire away! 
And fight for the flag! 
Rally round the flag boys, 
Give it ti the breeze, 
That’s the banner we love,
On the land and seas. 
Let the colors fly boys, 
Guard them day and night, 
For victory is liberty, 
And God will bless the right! 
Then rally round the flag boys, 
Rally round, rally round, 
Rally round the flag boys, 
Rally round the flag! 

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Rally round the flag, boys, 
Rally round, Rally round, 
Rally round the flags, boys, 
Rally round the flag!

2. Their flag is but a rag. 
Our’s is the true one, 
Up with the stars and stripes! 
Down with the new one!
