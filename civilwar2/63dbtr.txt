1.
Down by the river there lived a maiden,
In a cottage built just seven by nine,
And all around this lubly bower,
The beauteous sunflower blossoms twine.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! my Clema, Oh! my Clema,
Oh! my darling Clementine,
Now you are gone and lost forever,
I'm dreadful sorry Clementine.

2.
Her lips were like two luscious beefsteaks
Dipp'd in tomato sauce and brine,
And like the cashmere goatess covering
Was the fine wool of Clementine.

3.
Her foot, Oh! Golly! Twas a beauty,
Her shoes were made of Dig-by pine,
Two herring boxes without the tops on
Just made the sandals  of Clementine.

4.
One day de wind was blowing awful
I took her down some old rye wine,
And listened to de sweetest cooings,
Ob my sweet sunflower Clementine.

5.
De ducks had gone done to de riber,
To drive dem back she did incline,
She stubb'd her toe and Oh! Kersliver,
She fell into the foamy brine.

6.
I see'd her lips above de waters,
A blowing bubbles bery fine,
But 'turnt no use I want no swimmer,
And so I lost my Clementine.

7.
Now ebry night down by the riber,
Her ghostess walks long half past nine
I know tis her a kase I tracked her,
And by de smell tis Clementine.

8.
Now all young men by me take warning,
Don't gib your ladies too much rye wine,
Kase like as not is this wet wedder,
Dey'll share de fate ob Clementine.
