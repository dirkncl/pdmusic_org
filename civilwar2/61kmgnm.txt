   In the Government hospital on the day after the battle,
lay a youthful member of the Ellsworth Zouave Corps, who,
notwithstanding the frightful nature of his wounds, bor his
sufferings with a patient heroism akin to inspiration. For
a long time he seemed unconscious of the presence of his
heart-broken mother, who watched by his couch fondly, yet in
anquish of spirit, and lay like one in a trance.
   At length, turning slowly over, on his side, his vacant
eyes met her longing, againized gaze.  A train of long-buried
recollections seemed instantly to have awakened themselves in
his bosom, and, murmurming with the artlessness of a child,
“kiss me good night, mother,” he fell back and was dead.

1. Mother, dear mother, the day has seemed long
Since the lark warbled his matinal song:
Sadly the hours have passed, fled since the morn;
Darkly the moments that ne’er can return;
No beaming hopefulness, no joyous ray,
No cheerful sunshine to brighten my way.
But, mother, your kiss turns the darkness to light;
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night,
Thy tender love, mother, turns all to light;
Kiss me good  night, mother, kiss me good night.

2. Mother, dear mother, I’m longing for rest,—
Longing to slumber for aye with the blest;
But when my sad spirit from earthlike is free,
Still shall thy presence  seem nigh unto me.
Oft thy last kiss shall fall soft on my brow—
Sadly thine eyes gaze upon me as now;
And often I’ll say with the angels in white,
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night:
Thy tender love, mother, makes all so bright;
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.
