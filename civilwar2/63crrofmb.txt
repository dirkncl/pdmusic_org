1. Come rally round our Flag my boys,
  Give it to the breeze;
For what’s the Flag we love my boys,
  On the land and seas:
There’s brave hearts under it,
  Let the traitors brag;
Our gallant boys will fire away.
  Fighting for their Flag.

CHORUS [2nd twoce after each VERSE]
Rally round the Flag my boys,
  Give it to the breeze;
That’s the Flag we all love boys,
  On the land and seas.

2. It’s floating high above us boys,
  It’s glowing in the sun;
It’s speaking to our hearts my boys,
  Of a freedom won:
And who dare sully it,
  Bought with precious blood;
Our gallant boys will fight for it,
  Tho’ their’s should swell the flood.

3. Let tyrants learn to fear it, boys,
  And tremble at the sight;
But all who sigh for freedom, boys,
  Will hail it with delight:
Let freedom and liberty,
  Eternal echos ring;
For that is what the world wants,
  And that our Flag will bring.

4. Huzzah, huzzah, huzzah, my boys,
  Raise our Banners high;
Shout for the Stars and Stripes,
  Let the echos fly:
Through all distant lands,
  Andfar beyond the sky;
Hear the words of Washington,
  “Conquer boys, or die.”
