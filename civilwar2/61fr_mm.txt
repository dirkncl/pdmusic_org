CHORUS [sung before each VERSE]
Freemen! Freemen! from mountain from valley
Fill our ranks, fill our ranks, rally, rally, rally!
The harvest in our fields, there let parch,
Unfurl our flag and march! march! march!

1. Nerve ev’ry arm and strike a deadly blow
And lay in the dust proud oppressors low
Rushing at their ranks scatter far the band
That dares to enslave Freedom’s chosen Land.

2. O’er mountain o’er valley loudly beats the drum
And freemen are showing We come! We come!
“Liberty or death” ev’ry freeman’s cry
“Freemen we have lived, freemen we will die.”

3. The tramping of our feet, echoes back a sound!
Response of our Sires! who sleep ’neath this ground,
Strike for their graves, the home of the free
Which their blood bought and they gave to thee.

4. “That Heaven Starr’d flag left thee as its heir
Traitors shall not tarnish! Swear! Freemen! Swear.”
O’er land and o’er sea Vict’ry it shall bear
By no stain tarnish’d We swear! We swear!

5. Great God of battles! ere we be slaves
Where the gun rattles spend thou our graves!
O’er our cold sod, let freedom’s flag fly
Marking the spot, where we wish to lie!
