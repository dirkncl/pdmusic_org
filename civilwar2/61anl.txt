1. Anthem of liberty,
Solemn and grand,
Wake in thy loftiness,
Sweep through the land!
Light in each breast anew
Patriot fires,
Pledge the old flag again,
Flag of our sires!
Fling all thy folds abroad,
Banner of light!
Fling all thy folds abroad,
Banner of light!
Wave, wave forever,
Flag of our might!
God for our banner
Freedom and Right!
Wave, wave forever,
Flag of our might!
God for our banner,
Freedom and Right!
God for our banner,
Freedom and Right!
Amen! Amen!

2. Spirit of unity,
Potent, divine,
Come in thy kindliness,
All hearts in twine!
Prove to our enemies
Ever a rock,
And to each traitorscheme
Ruinous shock!
Wake the old banner word,
Shout it amain,
Wake the old banner word!
Shout it amain,
Union forever!
Once and again!
Union forever
God it maintain!
Union forever!
Once and again!
Union forever!
God it maintain!
Union forever!
God it maintain!
Amen! Amen!

3. Shades of our forefathers,
Pass through the land,
Clothed in full majesty,
Terrible, grand!
Fright from their lurking place
Treason and wrong,
Wake the old loyalty,
Earnest and strong!
This for our panoply,
What can befall?
This for our panoply,
What can befall?
Steadfast and loyal,
Naught can appal!
Thus to be loyal
God help us all!
Steadfast and loyal,
Naught can appal!
Thus to be loyal
God help us all!
Thus to be loyal
God help us all!
Amen! Amen!

4. Come, kindly trinity,
Noblest and best,
“Faith, Hope and Charity,”
Rule in each breast!
Faith, in our Fatherland,
Hope, in our Lord,
Charity still to all
Blindly who’ve erred!
God save the Government!
Long it defend!
God save the Government!
Long it defend!
Thine is the Kingdom,
Father and Friend!
Thine be the glory
World without end!
Thine is the Kingdom,
Father and Friend!
Thine be the glory,
World without end!
Thine be the glory,
World without end!
Amen! Amen!
