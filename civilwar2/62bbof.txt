1. Blest banner of Freedom, thy pinion
Floats wide o’er the land and the sea;
The em emblem of peaceful dominion,
Ours eyes turn with rapture to thee.
Though war clouds and dangers are o’er us,
Thy folds are still dear to our view;
With the flag of our country before us,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue:
With the Flag of our country before us,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue.

2. The glorious ensign ne’er sever,
Let it float in the ether above,
Its stars. the bright symbol forever
Of Union, and Freedom, and love;
May they never grow dim in their shining,
Nor fade from their colors so true,
The Stars and the Stripes still entwining,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue.

3. Though traitors shall meet and dissemble,
And armies of rebels shall rise,
Our banner shall cause them to tremble,
As it waves in the bright southern skies;
And millions of patriot voices
Shall the chorus of Freedom renew,
And a shout, as the nation rejoices,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Blue.

4. Though tyrants and despots assail it,
And threaten our land to deform,
To the mast head and flag staff weˆll nail it,
And bear it aloft though the storm,
Our Country no foe shall dissever,
While the armies of Freedom prove true,
The Flag of our Union forever,
We’ll march to the Red, White and Red.
