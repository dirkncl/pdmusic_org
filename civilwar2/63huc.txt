1. The wheel is turning round, boys,
  Hurra now for the jam;
How are you, conscripts? Hurry up!
  To fight for Uncle Sam:
Come up, Bob, don’t stand there shaking,
  Take your musket, Shoulder arms!
Stand in line with Larry Brady,
  Who now cares for war’s alarms?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
How are you, constripts? ha, ha, ha, ha,
On with the draft, hurra, hurra.
How are you, constripts? ha, ha, ha, ha,
On with the draft, hurra!

2. Hark, the drum is rolling,
  The rebs you soon will see,
And pop them off like pigeons,—
  What glorious fun ’twill be!
Put away that dirty wiper,
  What a time to pipe your eye!
Hold your head up, courage, conscript,
  Soldiers never fear to die!

3. Shoulder arms, now conscripts,
  Blackguard— what’s your name?
Terance Darby— blood an’ ouns!
  How Paddy jumps for fame!
Frenchmen, Scotchmen, all press forward,
  O mein got! here mynheer comes!
Blow the bugle, split the trumpet,
  Shout hosannas! pelt the drums!
