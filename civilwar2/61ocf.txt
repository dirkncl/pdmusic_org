Song Composed and Dedicated to

Poetry and Music by G. Gumpert.

1.
Beneath the Stars and Stripes there stand
  Our sons so nobly brave,
United by a holy hand,
  Their courage fears no grave.

REFRAIN
Our country's flag let proudly wave,
  For freedom is our shield;
The Union must and shall be saved,
  We'll never never yield.

CHORUS
Our country's flag let proudly wave,
  For freedom is our shield;
The Union must and shall be saved,
  We'll never never yield.

2.
Let traitors boast but for awhile,
  We'll meet them on the field;
The Stars and Stripes know naught of guile,
  For freedom is our shield.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
We'll fight to conquer or to die,
  Our cause is just and right;
"E Pluribus Unum" is our cry--
  The Lord with us is might.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
Rally, ye souls, ye noble men!
  Buckle the armor on;
Follow your father's footsteps, then
  The battle will be won.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

5.
O glorious Union, happy land,
  We'll shed our blood for thee;
Thou sacred gift of father's hand
  Thou land of liberty.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

6.
We'll soon disperse our country's gloom,
  We are and will be free;
The curse of God, the traitor's doom,
  Awaits our enemy.
