1. Bravely he fought, as a hero he died;
Worthy he bled for his country, his pride.
He no more to glory shall lead his brave band,
No more they’ll obey his warrior command.

CHORUS 1 [sung twice]
Who led them to vic’try, shall lead them no more;
He led them to glory Whose battles are o’er.

2. Calmly he slumbers, where long will his dust,
Hallow the grave of the brave and the just.
His heroic deeds have honore’d the name
Which long shall embellish the annals of fame.

CHORUS 2 [sung twice]
His name is immortal, his soul is at rest;
His heart no more beats in a brave warrior’s breast.

3. They’ve buried him low, where proudly shall wave
Am emblem of Stars o’er a warrior’s grave;
His pall was the Banner for which he died;
They’ve buried him low, ’neath the folds of his pride.

CHORUS 3 [sung twice]
No tombstone erect where millions shall weep—
Glory will trace where a hero doth sleep.
