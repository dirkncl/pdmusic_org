1. Sae braw we marched along,
By our laddie Captain led;
Sae drear we sit and mourn,
For, aweel, our laddie’s dead.
For, aweel, our laddie’s dead. 

2. We lo’ed his winsome face,
And his bonnie hair o’ brown;—
We needna blush for shame,
That our tears are rinnin down.
That our tears are rinnin down.

3. Sic pride we felt to say
That he battled at our head;
For bravest among a’
Was our laddie wha is dead.
Was our laddie wha is dead.

4. O Jem, his faither’ll groan,
And his mither, sair will greet;
When at the auld door stane,
Their murder’d bairn they’ll meet.
Their murder’d bairn they’ll meet.

5. And there’s anither ane,
Oh the young, young bride afar;
Lang, lang she’ll wait to hail
Her lover frae the war.
Her lover frae the war.

6. We willna only dool
For our laddie wha has died;
We maun ha’ bluid for bluid,
E’er we cast our swords aside.
E’er we cast our swords aside.

7. The truest o’ the true,
Ye ha’ slaughtered on this day;—
We follow on your track
As the bandogs after prey.
As the bandogs after prey.

8. And by the God aboon,
When to battle we are led,—
Revenge we ilk shall seek,
For our laddie wha is dead.
For our laddie wha is dead.
