1. We do think of thee at home,
Absent though thou be;
Sooner shall we cease to breathe,
Than cease to think of thee.
Never can our love grow cold,
Though from us you roam;
Nor from us thine image fade,
While thou are from home.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We do think of thee at home,
Absent though thou be;
Sooner shall we cease to breathe,
Than sease  to think of thee.

2. Nor can we those songs forget,
Which you often sung;
And the harp your gently struck,
Though now it lies unstrung.
Let this message wing its way,
Swiftly o’er the sea;
And assure thine anxious heart,
That we think of thee.

3. Morning light does e’er reveal,
Objects to our view;
To recall past scenes again,
And former joys renew.
Thus while thought and mem’ry last,
Thou are ever near;
And we nev er can forget,
One to us so dear.
