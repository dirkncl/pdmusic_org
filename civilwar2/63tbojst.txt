1.
Jeff Davis he set in the Rebel divan,
A thinking what wickedness next he would plan,
Says he "we must wallop these yanks pretty quick,
Or some of our folk, of this War might get sick."

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Singing too ral lal loo ral lal loo ral i day.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Singing too ral lal loo ral lal loo ral i day.

"So Lee you must march into Pennsylvaniay,
And fill up your wagons with oats and with hay,
Whilst frightnin them Dutchmen and seizin their cattle,
And if they mislist you jest give 'em a battle."

3.
Then Lee started off and he made a grand sally,
Amongst the rich farmers of Cumberland Valley,
He Chambersburg robb'd and he batter'd Carlisle
And Harrisburg reach'd within two of three mile.

4.
At length he got rang'd all in order to strike,
But who should he meet on the Gettysburg Pike,
But them very same Vet'rans he left on Potomac
Which they gave him a ifter that sickened his stomach.

5.
How Vicksburg was took on the very next day,
And likewise Port Hudson soon had to give way,
Jeff Davis a losin these places so strong,
It made his pale visage look wonderful long.

6.
Then hurrah for the Stars and hurrah for the Stripes,
And down with Jeff Davis consarn his old tripes,
For two Sebastopols and one Waterloo,
Is pretty fair work in a fortnight, says you.

[7.] M O R A L.
How all ye seceshioners mind what I say,
Don't never advance into Pennsylvaniay,
For sure as you're born (it can easy be shown)
Seceshers by Yankees are soon overthrown.
