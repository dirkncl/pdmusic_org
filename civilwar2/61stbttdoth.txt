1. Sadly the bells toll the death of the hero,
Hoarsely the cannon booms o’er the sad wave,
Heavily droops the fair flag of his country
Dearer to him than the life which he gave.
The Stars and the Stripes from dishonor to save.

2. Fresh as the morn of his fame waves the laurel,
Wet by a lifeblood still sparkling with youth,
O’er his still grave where the din of our battles
Wakes not the victim of cowardly ruth;
Sleep sleep fearless champion of freedom and truth.

3. Zouaves to the combat, Zouaves rush on to glory;
Ellsworth’s young blood marks the steep path of fame,
Ellsworth! the battle cry, lo! he lies gory,
Let your bright swords carve a niche for his name:
Aye Traitors! his blood seals the day of your shame!
