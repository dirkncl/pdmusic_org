1. We have giv’n our sons and brothers,
We have giv’n our fathers too;
And have sent them forth to battle,
For the Red, the White, and Blue!
Oh! their footsteps echoed proudly,
To the Union music trod;
And their trust in Father Abra’am,
And the strong right arm of God!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then shout aloud in chorus,
Come brothers, one and all,
United, floats our banner!
Divided it must fall.

2. And they’ve borne our banners bravely
Thro’ the thickest of the fight,
Shouting death to this rebellion!
And may God protect the right,
But they now are worn and weary,
Marching ’neath the southern sun.
And the twilighjt dew is falling,
And the day is not yet won!

3. For the love of God these brothers;
By each noble patriot grave,
By the mother, sister and the other,
Strive our Country’s Flag to save.
Oh! wait not the Autumn harvest,
Or the garnered golden grain,
Rally round our glorious banner!
And we’ll greet the world again!
