1. Deep in a shady dell,
I met him while culling sweet summer flowers,
And then he vow’d to love me, how well
Forever mid sunshine and in showers.
Oh how my bosom did thrill,
What moments of bless then were mine,
’Twas there he first ask’d me to wed,
I blush’d, sigh’d and said yes, I’m thine,

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Yes, deep in a shady dell,
I met him while culling sweet summer flowers,
And there he vow’d to love me, how well!
Forever mid sunshine and showers,
Forever mid sunshine and in showers.

2. Hark! tis the well known horn,
As homeward he bounds from o’er hill and plain,
Oh how his presence my heart doth warm,
To welcome his footsteps back again.
Oh how my bosom doth thrill,
To know the he loves me still,
And says, Thou art mine live, I’m thine,
Yes love, I am thine, yes, 
I’m thine, (yes, love, I’m thine yes, love, I’m thine)
