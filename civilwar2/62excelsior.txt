1.
The shades of night were falling fast
As through an Alpine village passed,
A youth who bore mid snow and ice
A banner with the strange device,
Excelsior!

2.
His brow was sad, his eye beneath
Flash'd like a [faulehion] from its sheath,
And like a silver clarion rung,
The accents of that unknown tongue,
Excelsior! Excelsior! Excelsior!

3.
"Try not the pass," The old man said,
"Dark tow'rs the tempest over head,
The roaring torrent is deep and wide,"
But loud that clarion voice replied,
Excelsior! Excelsior! Excelsior!

4.
"Oh! stay," the maiden said, "and rest
Thy wear head upon my breast;"
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,
But still he answered with a sigh,
Excelsior! Excelsior! Excelsior!

5.
"Beware the pine tree's withered branch!
Bewar the awful avalanche,"
This was the peasant's last good night,
A voice replied far up the height,
Excelsior!

6.
A traveller by the faithful hound
Half buried in the snow was found,
Still grasping in his hand of ice
That banner with the strange device,
Excelsior!
