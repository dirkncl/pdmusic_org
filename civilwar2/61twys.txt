1. Thirteen the number of the stripes 
Alternate white and red, 
Sixstripes attest a spotless faith, 
Seven show that blood was shed, 
The blood of men of thirteen states, 
Which join’d their arms and link’d their fates, 
’Till time shall be no more, 
Till time shall be no more.
And thirteen stripes shall be our boast, 
And they shall wave o’er flood and coast, 
Along Columbia’s shore, 
Along Columbia’s shore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then wave ye striped o’er flood and coast, 
And shine ye stars!
a peaceful host, 
’Till time shall be no more, 
’Till time shall be no more!

2. The stars we reckon thirty  four, 
Set in a heaven of blue;
Each star a world within itself, 
Each in its  orbit true, 
Thirteen at first, now thirtyfour;
We’ve added twenty and one more, 
Why do we falter now!
Why do we falter now!
Our childrem’s children yet may see 
Stars equal to a century, 
Worn on Columbia’s brow, 
Worn on Columbia’s brow.

3. The sun as sackcloth shall grow black, 
The moon he turned to blood, 
And stars of heaven shall fall to earth, 
Wrapped in wrath’s fiery floodl;
But till that day of terror come, 
’Till earth shall cease to be man’s home, 
We’ll trust in God  most high, 
We’ll trust in God most high, 
That into darkness not one star 
Shall wander, nor by crimson war 
Be dashed from our blue sky, 
Be dashed from our blue sky.
