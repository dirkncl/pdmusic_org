1. Six Hundred Thousand is the cry,
Come rally to the call;
For Abra’am says he must have them,
Or else the Union’ll fall!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Then surely boys you’ll onward march
To meet the rebel band—
Six Hundred Thousand is the cry
Throughout our native land.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Six Hundred Thousand is the cry 
Througout our native land.

2. Come forth ye brave and gallant men!
And never backward be!
Fill up the ranks, and meet the foes
Of Peace and Liberty.

3. Come from the workshop and the plough,
Coumbia’s noble sons!
And buckle on your armour boys,
And bring along your guns.

4. Then down to Dixie we will march
To strike the final blow!
And there with firm and steady aim
We’ll lay the traitor’s low.

5. We’ll swear to plant our glorious flag
On Richmond’s soil again!
Or every one among our ranks
Shall number with the slain!
