1. Come, come, march at your Country’s call, 
Stand your arms and march in good order; 
March, march, march at your Country’s call, 
Join brave McClellan’s boys over the border; 
See your proud banner spread, 
Waving above your head, 
With stars & stripes so famous in story— 
Mount and make ready then, 
Sons of the mountain glen, 
Fight ’neath your flag, for Union and glory 

[CHORUS 1]
Come, Come, march at your Country’s call, 
Stand your arms and march in good order; 
March, marcch, march ar your Country’s call, 
Join brave McClellan’s “boys” over the border. 

2. Come from the hill where your cattle are grazing, 
Come, come the anvil, the workshop and field, 
And “Haste to the rescue,” with this motto blazing, 
With God’s help, rebellion and treason shall yield. 
The clarion is sounding, The warsteeds are bounding, 
Shoulder the musket and march in good order. 
Secesh shall from that hour, 
Loose all its boasted power 
When our brave army comes 
Secesh shall from that hour, 
Loose all its boasted power 
When our brave army comes over the border. 

[CHORUS 2]
Come from the hills where your cattle are grazing 
Come from the anvil, the workshops and field, 
And “Haste to the rescure,” with this motto blazing, 
“With God’s help, rebellion and treason shall yield.”
