1. O Abram Linkon las’ September 
Told de Souf ’less you surrender 
Afore de las’ of next December, 
Away goes Cuffee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For the cannon may boom when dey fight a big battle, 
But de Darkeys no more as de sheep and de cattle, 
For Freedom’s watchman has sprung his rattle, 
Hooray for sixty three.

2. De Souf deys mad at Norfs invasion
Said Abe Linkon’s Proclamation
Dont go down in darkey nation
Nor way goes Cuffee.

3. Dar’s France she favors Mediation
England scorns dis rival nation
And wants to see a separation
Away goes Cuffee.

4. But Abe sustains his trying station,
Says to France and English nation 
Just stand back wid Mediation
Away goes Cuffee.

5. De Yankee soldiers shout Hosanna
While dey wave de Spangled banner 
Bound for Charleston and Savannah
Away goes Cuffee.

6.  Richmond’s walls Ole Joe will batter
How de Rebels den will scatter 
Hang Jeff D. and end dis matter,
Away goes Cuffee.
