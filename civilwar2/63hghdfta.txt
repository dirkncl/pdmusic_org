1.
My Jimmy's got home I am ever so glad,
He's got his discharge from the army.
He behav'd himself well, and he was a brave lad,
So they gave him his discharge from the army.
The boys they all lov'd him, his Capt'n did say
That in hattle around hum dead rebels did lay,
He fought for his country, and not for the pay,
So he got his discharge from the army.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh Jimmy dear, your Mammy's so glad,
That you're safely at home from the army,
He's a dear darling buy and a brave little lad,
And he's got his discharge from the  army.

2.
His coat is all tatter'd, his trousers are torn,
But he's got his discharge from the army.
We'll give him a brand new suit now he has got home,
And all the brave boys of our army.
Now queer is the styly, that the chivalry wear,
When Jeff Davis thought our brave boys would scare,
And for his wife's advice not a bit did they care,
He was too good a prize for our army.

3.
Now rebellion is o'er and Jeffy got botch'd,
'Twas done by our boys of the army.
There's Davis and Co. they ought to be strech'd
'Twould suit all the boys in our army.
But I'm mighty pleas'd he is done up so well,
Rebellion is crushed, the traitors have fell.
But what tickles me about is that my Jimmy is well
And he's got his discharge from the army.
