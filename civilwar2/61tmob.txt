1. While war’s alarms are ringing 
Through our our native land, 
While millions join in ringing 
In anthem loud and grand!
Amid the dire confusion 
That sweeps our nation o’er 
We’ll not forget the Soldiers 
Who fell at Baltimore!

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
We’ll not forget the Soldiers 
Who fell at Baltimore!

2. Defenders of the Union!
Immortal you will be!
You scorned at base Disunion, 
And died for Liberty!
The ruffians that so basely 
Left you weltering in gore, 
Shall rue the day, brave Soldiers, 
You fell at Baltimore!

3. “Twas Massachusett’s Soldiers 
Who fell upon that day;
They died like noble heroes, 
As life’s blood flowed away;
Let each one then remember, 
Though much we may deplore, 
They died for us most nobly, 
Who fell at Baltimore.
