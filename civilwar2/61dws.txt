1.
Hear ye not the sounds of battle,
Sabres' clash and muskets' rattle?
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
Hostile footsteps on our border,
Hostile columns tread in order;
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, fly to arms in Dixie!
  To Arms! to Arms!
From Dixie's land we'll rout the land,
That comes to conquer Dixie,
  To Arms! (to Arms!) To Arms! (to Arms!)
and rout the foe from Dixie!
  To Arms! (to Arms!) To Arms! (to Arms!)
and rout the foe from Dixie!

2.
See the red smoke hanging o'er us!
Hear the cannon's booming chorus!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
See our steady columns forming,
Hear the shouting! hear the storming!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!

3.
Gird you loins with sword and sabre,
Give your lives to Freedom's labor!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
What though every hearth be saddened?
What though all the land be reddened?
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!

4.
Shall this boasting, mad invader
Trample Dixie and degrade her?
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
By our fathers proud example!
Southern soil they shall not trample!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!

5.
Southrons, meet them on the border!
Charge them into wild disorder!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
Hew the Vandals down before you!
Till the last inch they restore you!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!

6.
Through the echoing hills resounding,
Hear the Southern bugles sounding!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
Arouse from every hill and valley,
List the bugle! Rally! rally!
  To Arms! to Arms, to Arms in Dixie!
