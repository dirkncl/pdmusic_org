Why, soldiers, why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers,  why? whose business ’tis to die.
Why, soldiers, why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers, why? whose business ’tis to die.
Should next campaign send us to HIM who made us, boys?
We’re free from pain, we’re free from pain!
Should we remain, a bottle and kind landlady
Cure all again, cure all again.
Then why, soldiers, why, why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers, why? whose business ’tis to die.
Why, solderis, why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers, why? whose business ’tis to die.
Why, soldiers, why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers, why? whose business ’tis to die.
Why, soldiers, why should we be melancholu, boys?
Why, soldiers, why? whose business ’tis to die.
