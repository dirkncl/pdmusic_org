1. How are you Greenbacks ten or twenty!
From one to five, I have got plenty!
Five dollars now is quite a sum, too,
Gold is worth more than what it comes to!

[Chorus lines sung after each line of VERSES]
Four forty on the turnpike gate;
How are you Father Abra’m?

Then while we sing, the heel tap ring
And the banjo sounds like a jimjam.

Four forty on the turnpike gate,
How are you Fathere Abra’m?

Then while we sing the heeltap ring,
And the banjo sounds like a jimjam.

CHORUS 1-5
Look to the East, look to the west,
Look way over dar,—
The railroad leads to the cookoo’s nest,
Then jump on board the car;
So good bye to the fair sex
And good bye to the thing call’d a greenback
“Over the left” we’re a coming
Three hundred million more!

2. Government wheels scream out, while turning,
“More soap! to keep the ‘Ex‘ from burning!”
Now Chase he is a clever laddy,
But Father Abra’am is his daddy.

3. If you’ve sore eyes and can’t endure ’em,
Look at the “Greenbacks:” that will cure ’em;
Hard times is nothing but a scarecrow,
For Greenback “money makes the mare go!”

4. Wall Street is but a small plantation,
Too small to ever rule the nation;
Old Father Abe dont care about it,
He gets on very well without it.

5. Three hundred dollars is a “clean” tax,
When one has pockets lined with Greenbacks;
But when this war comes to an ending,
Some characters will need some mendings!
