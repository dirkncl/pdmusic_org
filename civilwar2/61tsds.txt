1. Mother cease that sad repining, 
Sister soothe that anxious breast. 
For in glory’s arms re clining 
One more soldier sinks to rest. 
Never more of beauty’s weaving, 
Garlands gay will deck this brow, 
Cease my Nellie, cease from grieving, 
Fame’s green laurels crown me now. 

2. Am I dreaming! am I dying, 
Do I hear the village bell 
Softly tolling as if sighing 
From afar a long farewell! 
Fainter, fainter grows that pealing. 
Brighter, brighter dawns the view. 
Past is ev’ry earthly feeling, 
Glory, Mother, love! adieu.
