1. Along the green lane in the May time, 
I gather’d the  violets blue, 
Echoing yet with the bee song, 
And cool with the morning dew— 
Gather’d them for sweet Mabel, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
To clasp in her dainty fingers— 
To braid in her shining hair.

CHORUS 1
Gather’d them for sweet Mabel, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
To clasp in her dainty fingers— 
To braid in her shining hair.

2. Again when the summer was fairest, 
For love of her brown, brown eyes, 
I gather’d her royal flowers, 
As bright as the sunset skies— 
Gather’d them for sweet Mabel, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
To clasp in her dainty fingers— 
To braid in her shining hair.

CHORUS 2
Gather’d them for sweet Mabel, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
To clasp in her dainty fingers— 
To braid in her shining hair.

3. But now comes the dreary November, 
Making me to mourn and weep, 
For folding her dainty fingers, 
Mabel has gone to sleep, 
Closiing her brown eyes gently, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
No more shall I gather roses, 
To braid in her shining hair.

CHORUS 3
Closiing her brown eyes gently, 
Beautiful Mabel Clare, 
No more shall I gather roses, 
To braid in her shining hair.
