"On the 
Shores of Tennessee! 
Or, Return of the Old Flag!" (1862)

"Move my Arm Chair, faithful Pompey,
 In the Sunshine bright and strong.
 And I fain would hear the South-wind
 Bring once more the sound to me,
 Of the wavelets softly breaking
 On the Shores of Tennessee."

1. Move my armchair faithful Pompey, 
In the sunshine bright and strong, 
For this world is fading Pompey— 
Massa wont be with you long; 
And I fain would hear the south wind 
Bring the sound once more to me. 
Of the wavelets softly breaking 
On the shores of Tennessee, 
Of the wavelets softly breaking 
On the shores of Tennessee.

2. Mournful though the ripples murmur 
As they will the story tell 
How no vessels float the banner 
That I’ve loved so long and well; 
I shall listen to their music, 
Dreaming that again I see. 
Stars and Stripes on sloop and shallop 
Sailing up the Tennessee, 
Stars and Stripes on sloop and shallop 
Sailing up the Tennessee.

3. While the south wind fondly lingers 
’Mid the vet’ran’s silver hair, 
While the boundmon close beside him, 
Stands behind the old man’s chair; 
Ha! above the foliage yonder 
Something flutters wild and free! 
Massa! Massa! Hallelujah! 
The Flag’s come back to Tennessee! 
Massa! Massa! Hallelujah! 
The Flag’s come back to Tennessee.

4. Pompey hold me on your shoulder 
Help me stand on foot once more, 
That I may salute the collors, 
As they pass before my door. 
Here’s the paper signed that frees you, 
Give a freeman’s shout with me! 
God and Union be our watchword 
Evermore in Tennessee! 
God and Union be our watchword 
Evermore in Tennessee.
