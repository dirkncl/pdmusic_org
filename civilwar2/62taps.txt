Words: anonymous

1.
Day is done, gone the sun, 
From the hills, from the lake, 
From the skies. 
All is well, safely rest, 
God is nigh. 

2.
Go to sleep, peaceful sleep, 
May the soldier or sailor, 
God keep. 
On the land or the deep, 
Safe in sleep. 

3.
Love, good night, Must thou go, 
When the day, And the night 
Need thee so? 
All is well. Speedeth all 
To their rest. 

4.
Fades the light; And afar 
Goeth day, And the stars 
Shineth bright, 
Fare thee well; Day has gone, 
Night is on. 

5.
Thanks and praise, For our days, 
'Neath the sun, Neath the stars, 
'Neath the sky, 
As we go, This we know, 
God is nigh.
