"The Picket" (1862)
Ballad.
Music by William Cumming Peters. , 1805-1866

  It will be recollected, that several Pickets were frozen to
death a few weeks ago in the Army of the Potomac. They were
placed as Guards at night, and in the morning, were found
dead at their posts.

1. The night is cold and cheerless, the wint’ry blast blows chill 
Across the sluggish river, and o’er the dreary hill; 
And hour from camp the soldier on picketguard must go. 
Alone, while others slumber, to stand in cold and snow. 

2. With muffled step, in silence night’s solemn noon goes by; 
Her myriad stars gaze coldly upon him from on high, 
And far o’er vale and mountain his thoughts unbidden roam 
To old familiar faces and loving hearts at home. 

3. He sees his aged mother, her sad face marked with care, 
And by her side his sister for him some gift prepare. 
He hears them speak of Charlie and for his safety pray 
And knows their hearts are with him tho’ he is far away. 

4. At last when dawns the morning by relief of guard is found 
Still at his post, the soldier, stretch’d lifeless on the ground. 
A smile his pale lips parting,— as peaceful seems his rest, 
As is an infant’s slumber, upon its mother’s breast. 

QUARTETTE
But where the dark Ohio rolls slowly on its way, 
Within a cheerless homestead are heavy hearts today— 
Alonely widow’d mother sits bow’d in bitter woe, 
For she mourns her boy, her Charlie; who perish’d in the snow.
