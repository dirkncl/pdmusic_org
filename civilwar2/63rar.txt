"Riding a Raid" (1863)
Words: anonymous
Music: based on "Bonnie Dundee" an old Scotch air

1.
Tis old Stonewall the Rebel that leans on his sword:
"Now each cavalier that loves Honor and Right,
Let him follow the feather of Stuart to night!"
Come tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!

CHORUS
Come tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!

2.
Now gallop now gallop to swim o[']er t[']e ford!
Old Stonewall, still watching, prays low to the Lord:
"Now Bye dear old Rebel! the river's not wide,
And Mary-land's light's in her window to guide."
Come tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!

(CHORUS)

3.
There's a man in a white house with blood on his mouth!
If there's knaves in the North, there are braves in the South.
We are three thousand horses, and not one afraid;
We are three thousand sabres, and not one dull blade.
Come tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!

(CHORUS)

4.
Then gallop, then gallop by ravines and rocks!
Who would bar us the way take his toll in hard knocks;
For with these points of steel, on the line of Penn,
We have made some fine strokes, and we make them again.
Then tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!

CHORUS
Then tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
Come buckle you blanket and holster again;
Try the click of you trigger and balance you blade
For he must ride sure that goes Riding a Raid!
