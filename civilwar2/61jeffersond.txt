1. You’re a traitor convicted, you know verry well,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
You thought it a capital thing to rebel,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
But there’s one thing I’ll say
You’ll discover, some day,
When you see a stout cotton cord hand from a tree,
There’s an accident happend you didn’t foresee,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
There’s an accident happend you didn’t foresee,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D.

2. What shall be found upon history’s page?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
When the student explores the Republican age?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
He will find as is meet,
That at Judas’ feet,
You sit in your shame, with the impotent plea,
That you hated the land and the law of the free,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
That you hated the land and the law of the free,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D.

3. What do you see in your visions at night?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
Does the spectacal furnish you any delight?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
Do you feel in disgrace
The black cap o’re your face,
While the tremor creeps down from the heart to your knee,
And Freedom insulted approved the decree?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
And Freedom insulted approved the decree?
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D.

4. Oh, long have we pleaded, till pleading is vain,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
Your hands are imbrued with the blood of the slain,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
And at last for the right,
We rise in our might—
A People united, resistless and free,
And declare that rebellion no longer shall be,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D;
And declare that rebellion no longer shall be,
  Jefferson D, Jefferson D.
