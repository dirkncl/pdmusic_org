1.
Don't stop a moment to think, John,
  Our country calls then go.
Don't fear for me nor the children, John,
  I'll care for them you know.
Leave the corn upon the stalk, John,
  The fruit upon the tree,
And all our little stores, John,
  Yes, leave them all to me.

CHORUS
Then take your gun and go,
Yes, take your gun and go,
  For both can drive the oxen, John,
And I can use the hoe.

2.
I've heard my grandsire tell, John,
  He fought at Bunker Hill,
He counted all his life and wealth
  His country's off'ring still.
Would I shame the brave old blood, John,
  That flow'd on Monmouth plain!
No, take your gun and go, John,
  Tho', I ne'er see you again.

(CHORUS)

3.
The army's short of blankets, John,
  Then take this heavy pair,
I spun and wove them when a girl
  And work'd them with great care.
A rose in ev'ry corner, John,
  And here's my name you see,
On the cold ground they'll warmer feel,
  Because they're made by me.

(CHORUS)

4.
And John if God has willed it so
  We ne'er shall meet again
I'll do my best for the children John
  In sorrow, want or pain.
On winter nights, I'll teach them, John,
  All that I learned at school:
To love our country, keep her laws,
  Obey the Saviour's rule.

(CHORUS)

5.
And now goodby to you, John,
  I cannot say Farewell,
We'll hope and pray for the best John
  His goodness, none can tell;
May His arm be round about you, John,
  To guard you night and day
Be our beloved country's shield,
  Till war shall pass away.

(CHORUS)
