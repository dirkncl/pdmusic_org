Where in grief loved ones are sighing"

1. Tenderly, tenderly raise each form,
Cold on the battle plain lying,
Tenderly, tenderly bear them home,
Where in grief lov’d ones are sighing,
Gather fresh flowers and strew by the way.
Little birds carol your sweetest lay,
Sing where the lonely heart yearning in vain
Never can greet the dear smile a­ gain.
Angels that hover near
When the dim eyes tearfully,
First behold the coming bier,
Watch o’er them tenderly.

2. Tenderly, tenderly bear them home.
Life and its trials are over;
Tenderly, tenderly bear them all home.
Calm in their silent slumber,
Cherish in mem’ry, the noble and brave,
Dying for country its honor to save.
Sacred in all your hearts ’grave each dear name.
Shining in Heav’ns bright record of fame,
Let this thought check the sigh
“Not in the grave they lie”
Angels are bearing them homeward so tenderly.
