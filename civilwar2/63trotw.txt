1. Have you heard of the beautiful Realm of the West, 
Encircled by oceans, and kissed by the sun? 
Have you heard of the nations that thrive on her breast, 
Bright heirs of her grandeur, the “Many in one?” 
  Bright heirs of her grandeur, the “Many in one?”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Kings can not govern this land of our choice, 
Liberty love us, and peace is our guest; 
Shout for the Union with heart and with voice, 
God is our king in this realm of the West.

2. Have you seen our brave men? they are noble and true; 
The fame has gone forth of the deeds they have done, 
For when right led the van, to the sonflict they flew, 
And victory greeted the “Ma ny in one!” 
  And victory greeted the “Many in one!”

3. ’Tis the psalm of the free that is borne on the breeze,
It leaps from the heart of each patriot son;
While the fall surging chorus is sung by the seas,
Forever and ever, the “Many in one.”
  Forever and ever, the “Many in one.”
