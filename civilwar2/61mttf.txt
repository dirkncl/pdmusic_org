1. Our country calls today
We値l have to march away
To fight the south and stop their mouth
In America.

Chorus in unison. [sung after each VERSE]
O march to the field
Come march to the field
O march to the field
We池e ready for the fight
Our flag shall ever sway
On evry glorious day
For Washington and Jefferson
In America.

2. The union they did say
Should shiver and decay
But words like these,
They did not please
In America.

3. Old Jeff is sick they say
We heard the other day
Hehad better flee,
Or hung he値l be
In America.

4. When on the ground they lay
Their thoughts will roam away
They値l think of times,
They talked moonshine
In America.

5. Abe Lincoln in the chair
With his cabinet ware
He値l fence em in,
For their big sin
In America.

6. When on Virginias clay
McClellan we値l obey
We値l move along,
And sing this song
In America.

7. When the war is over
Oh then a happy day
The niggers free,
What joy will be
In America.
