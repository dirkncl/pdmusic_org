1. Mother is the battle over? 
Thousands have been slain, they say, 
Is my Father coming? tell me, 
Has our Army gained the day? 
Is he well or is he wounded? 
Mother do you think he’s slain? 
If you know I pray you tell me, 
Will my Father come again?

CHORUS 1 & 2
Mother is the battle over? 
Thousands have been slain, they say, 
Is my Father coming? tell me, 
Has our Army gained the day?

2. Mother dear, you’re always sighing, 
Since you last the paper read, 
Tell me, why you now are crying, 
Is our dearest Father dead? 
Ah! I see you cannot tell me 
Father’s one among the slain? 
Tho’ he lov’d us ve ry dearly 
Will he ever come again?

3. Yes, my boy, your noble father, 
Is one number’d with the slain, 
Tho, he lov’d us very dearly 
Ne’er on earth we’ll meet again, 
Fighting for our Glorious U nion 
Like a Hero he was slain, 
Still the day may not be distant, 
When in heav’n we’ll meet again!

CHORUS 3
Fighting for our Glorious Union, 
Like a Hero he was slain  
Still the day may not be distant, 
When in heav’n we’ll meet again,
