[Repeat each VERSE for the CHORUS]
1. [Soprano Solo]
My God save the Union! God grant it to stand 
The pride of our people the boast of our land 
Still, still ’mid the storm may our banner float free;
unrent and unriven o’er earth and o’er sea.

2. [Tenor Solo]
May God save the Union! We trust in its might 
In time of the tempest, in fear and in flight, 
We’ll fail not, we’ll faint not if still in the sky 
We see all the stars in the azure field fly.

3. [Basso Solo]
May God save the Union! Still still may it stand, 
Upheld by the strength of the patriot band, 
To cement it our fathers ensanquin’d the sod, 
To keep it we kneel to a merciful God.

4. [Trio for STB]
May God save the Union! The Red, White and Blue, 
Our States keep united the dreary day though 
Let the stars tell the tale of the glorious part 
And bind us in union forever to last.
