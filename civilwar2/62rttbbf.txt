1.
We are a band of Patriots who each leave home and friend,
Our noble Constitution and our banner to defend.
Our Capitol was threatened, and the cry rose near and far,
To protect our Country's glo-rious Flag that glitters with many a star.

CHORUS
Hurrah, Hurrah, for the Union, boys Hurrah,
Hurrah for our forefather's good old Flag, that glitters with many a star.

2.
Much patience and forebearance, the North has always shown,
Toward her Southern brethren, who had each way their own;
But when we made our President -- a man whom we desired,
Their wrath was roused, they mounted guns, and on Fort Sumpter fired.

(CHORUS)

3.
The forced war upon us, for peaceful men are we,
They steal our money, seize our forts, and then as cowards flee,
False to their vows, and to the Flag, that once protected them,
They sought the Union to dissolve, earth's noblest, brightest, gem.

(CHORUS)

4.
We're in the right, and will prevail, the Stars and Stripes must fly;
The "Bonnie Blue Flag", be hauled down and every traitor die,
Freedom and Peace enjoyed by all, as ne'er was known before,
Our Spangled Banner wave on high, with stars just Thirty Four.

(CHORUS)
