1. Who is the ye say is slain?
Whose voice answers not again?
ELLSWORTH, shall we call in vain,
On thy name today?
No! from ev’ry vale and hill
One response all hearts shall thrill:
ELLSWORTH’S fame is with us still,
Ne’er to pass away.

2. Bring that rebel banner low,
Hoisted by a treach’rous foe:
’Twas for that they dealt the blow,
Laid him in the dust.
Raise aloft, that all may see
His loved Flag of Liberty.
Forward then to victory,
Or perish if we must.

3. Hark to what Columbia saith:
“Mourn not for his early death,
With each patriot’s dying breath,
Strength renewed is giv’n
To the cause of TRUTH and RIGHT,
To the Land for which they fight.
After darkness cometh light,
Such the law of Heav’n.

4. So we name him not in vain
Though he comes out back again!
For his Country he was slain;
ELLSWORTH’S blood shall rise
To our gracious SAVIOURKING,
’Tis a holy gift we bring;
Such a sacred offering
God will not despise.
