1. There are tears mid the sunshine that brightens our way,
When our skies are the clearest and fairest the day,
For the heart that is fullest most given to joy,
Soon learns that its pleasure is naught but alloy.
CHORUS 1
Burning tears when all hope from the bosom is driven,
But O! happy thought,
There are no tears in heaven.
No tears, no tears! in heaven.

2. There are tears when in friendship the warmest and best;
That the heart ever cherish’d confiding we rest,
For the faith that we worship and think so sincere,
Hies away from its Alter when trouble is near.
CHORUS 2
Bitter tears for the vows which were hastily given,
But O! welcome truth,
There are no tears in heaven,
No tears! no tears! in heaven.

3. There are tears for the mourner thick mantled in gloom,
When the friend or the lover have gone to the tomb,
For the mound and the willow together are seen,
Where the spring spread— so lately its carpet of green.
CHORUS 3
Chilling tears when the grave has triumphantly striven!
But O! blissful home! There are no tears in heaven!
No tears, no tears! in heaven!
