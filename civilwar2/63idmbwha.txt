1. Lonely, weary, brokenhearted
  As I laid me down to sleep.
Thinking of the day we parted,
   When you told me not to weep.
Soon I dreamed that peaceful angels
  Hovered o’er the bottle plain,
Singing songs of joy and gladness,
  And my boy was home again.

CHORUS 1-3.
How well I know such thoughts of joy,
  Such dreams of bliss are vain;
My heart is sad, my tears will flow,
  Until my boy is home again.

2. Tears were changed to loud rejoicings,
  Night was turned to endless day!
Lovely birds were sweetly singing,
  Flowers bloomed in light array,
Old and young seemed light and cheerful—
  Peace seemed everywhere to reign;
My poor heart forgot its sorrow,
  For my boy was home again.

3. But the dream is past; and with it
  All my happiness is gone;
Cheerful thoughts of joy have vanished;
  I must still in sorrow mourn.
Soon may peace with all its blessings
  Our unhappy land reclaim;
Then my tears will cease their flowing,
  And my boy be home again.
