As the wife of one our Generals was passing along the rear, 
during the battle of Gettysburg, she saw a young soldier, 
whom she had known from childhood, wounded unto death; 
and while tears fell from her eyes upon his face, 
she asked if there was anything she could do for him. 
His answer was, "I am dying; but one request I have to make: 
it is that when you return to our native village, you would see 
my friends, and while you breather to them my dying blessing, 
O, kiss my mother dear for me."


1. O! kiss my mother dear fir me, 
Gently kiss her furrow’d brow; 
Dry the tears that fast are falling, 
For her boy who’s dying now, 
Never more shall I caress her, 
Her sweet smile I’ll ne’er more see, 
Life I’ve given for my country, 
Kiss my mother dear for me.

2. If mother dear were near me, 
’Twould not seem so hard to die, 
Hard to leave loved friends and comrades; 
In a soldier’s grave to lie. 
Yes, kind friend, I know I’m dying, 
But one boon I’ll crave from thee; 
When sweet flow’rs are o’er me blooming,
Kiss my mother dear for me.

3. Death’s chill is now upon me, 
Faint er, sounds the battle din, 
And bright angels, wait to bear me, 
To the world, that’s free from sin. 
Once I thought to fight for honour, 
But a crown of life ’twill be; 
I am going! when you see her, 
Kiss my mother dear for me.

Soon I’ll sleep in death’s cold slumber, 
Soon in Heav’n at rest I’ll be, 
For the Stars and Stripes I’ve fallen; 
Kiss my mother, Kiss my mother dear for me.
