1. Our Father on His heavenly throne,
Revered and praised in song,
With favor hears the grateful tone,
We raise with heart and tongue;
And next the sacred seraph choir,
With holier accents band,
Prefers the patriot’s tuneful lyre,
For home, for home & fatterland.

CHORUS 1.
And next the sacred seraph choir,
With holier accents band,
||: Prefers the patriot’s tuneful lyre,
For home, for home & fatterland. :||

2. Raise, brothers, raise in union true,
The wide resounding cry;
They hold in Heaven but virtures few,
Who land and home deny!
For man nor friend the heart can glow,
Congealed its feelings stand,
That’s cold when prayer and music flow,
For home, for home & fatherland.

CHORUS 2.
For man nor friend the heart can glow,
Congealed its feelings stand,
||: That’s cold when prayer and music flow,
For home, for home & fatherland. :||

3. Protect, oh God! watch o’er our homes,
In which we breathe so free;
Where yet our children’s cradles stand,
And where ttheir graves shall be.
With hearts deep moved we humbly pray,
From thy paternal hand,
Our country’s wealthy power display
For home, for home & fatherland.

CHORUS 3.
With hearts deep moved we humbly pray,
From thy paternal hand,
||: Our country’s wealthy power display
For home, for home & fatherland. :||
