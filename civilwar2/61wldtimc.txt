1. Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there, 
Where Liberty dwells,  is my Country; 
There and only there, 
Though storms should howl around her, 
And skies be overcast; 
And the good ship seem just to founder, 
Still boys, we give tot the blast;

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there 
Where Liberty dwells in my Country; 
There and only there.

2. Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there, 
Where Liberty dwells,  is my Country; 
There and only there, 
That land we will defend her
While floats our flag on high;
Our motto is “never surrender”
Fight till we conquer or die.

3. Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there, 
Where Liberty dwells,  is my Country; 
There and only there.
That star sprent flag once covered
Our Washington, the blest;—
That eagle victorious has hovered,
:Long o’er our bravest and best;—

4. Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there, 
Where Liberty dwells,  is my Country; 
There and only there.
And know there’s one who never
Bids a good cause go down;—
God reigns, and his favor is ever
With us, with our foes, his frown.

5. Where Liberty dwells is my Country; 
There only there; there only there, 
Where Liberty dwells,  is my Country; 
There and only there.
Sing then, bid those who love us
Join in our song so free;
The heavens are smiling above us,
Success, Peace, and Liberty.
