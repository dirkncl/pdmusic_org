1.
By Killarney's lakes and fells,
Em'rald isles and winding bays,
Mountain paths and woodland dells,
Mem'ry ev'er fondly strays.

Bountaeous nature loves all land;
Beauty wanders ev'ry where,
Footprints leaves on many strands,
But her home is surely there!

Angels fold their wings and rest,
In that Eden of the west,
Beauty's home Killarney,
Ever fair Killarney.

2.
Innisfldten's ruin'd shrine,
May suggest a passing sigh,
But man's faith can ne'er decline,
Such God's wonders floating by.

Castle Lough and Glona bay,
Mountains Tore and Eagles nest,
Still at Mucross you must pray,
Though the monks are now at rest.

Angels wonder no the man,
There would fain prolong life's span,
Beauty's home Killarney,
Ever fair Killarney.

3.
No place else can charm the eye
With such bright and varied tints,
Ev'ry rock that you pass by,
Verdure broiders or besprints.

Virgin there the green grass grows,
Ev'ry morn tiprings natal day.
Bright hued berries daff the snows,
Smiling winter's frown away.

Angels often pausing there,
Doubt if Eden were more fair,
Beauty's home Killarney,
Ever fair Killarney.

4.
Music there for Echo dwells,
Makes each sound a harmony,
Many voic'd the chorus swells,
Till it faints in ecstacy.

With the charmful tints below,
Seems the Heav'n above to vie,
All rich colors that we know,
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky.

Wings of Angels so might shine,
Glancing back with light divine,
Beauty's home Killarney,
Ever fair Killarney.
