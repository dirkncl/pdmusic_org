1. My Country so dear, I view’d with delight,
Abounding in wealth, and peerless in might;
When lo a dark cloud did evil portray!
In vision I saw a terrible day,
In vision I saw a terrible day.
And forth to my gaze, with pomp and with pride,
A demon of war, his charger did ride;
Who said as he rais’d his conquering hand,
“I’ll spread cruel woes, and death o’er the land.
Oppression is mine, and hatred to right,
And freedom I’ll crush, with vigor and might,
And freedom I’ll crush, with vigor and might.”

2. The wings of the wind, his spirit convey’d,
And breasts all enflam’d, his summons obey’d;
He marshall’d his hosts, o’er hill and o’er plain,
The sons of the land, were mangled and slain,
The sons of the land, were mangled and slain.
The timid with fear, from homesteads did fly,
Fair cities assailed, in ashes did lie.
He scatter’d rich stores and millions of gold,
And multiplied ills, and sorrows untold
My Country then mourn’d o’er hopes that were fled,
The fate of the land, and graves of the dead,
The fate of the land, and graves of the dead.

3. When quickly from heav’n, an angel of light,
Disarm’d the proud foe, and put him to flight;
His hosts were subdued, they scatter’d and fled,
And freedom’s strong arms, to victory led,
And freedom’s strong arms, to victory led.
Then see on my ear, this message of love,
Thy Country’s dark hour, a blessing shall prove,
For tyranny’s pow’r forever shall cease,
And o’er thee shall wave the banner of peace;
In wisdom and strength, thy Country shall be,
A home for the brave, a land for the free,
A home for the brave, a land for the free.
