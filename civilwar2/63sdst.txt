1. We are the sons of Uncle Sam, and native to his land,
Fighting for our country now, and side by side we stand;
Old Uncle Sam’s a hero, as the nations all do know,
And when he’s on the battle field, he strikes an awful blow!

CHORUS 1-­4.
Hurrah! hurrah! strike down secession types,
And hoist on high that glorious Flag that bears the Stars and Stripes! 

2. Old Uncle Sam is good and great, he’s also true and just
And when his subjects don’t do right, he says they surely must;
He’s ever philanthropic till he sees that will not do,
And then he brings astonishment with soldiers brave and true.

3. Old Uncle Sam does rule supreme, o’er all his wide domain,
And when he says it must be so, his sons must not refrain;
For if they do they know that Uncle Sam will bring his force,
And make them do as he desires, which will be right of course.

4. Old Uncle Sam’s the same old sage, whom Washington adored,
Who whipp’d the Brtish lion twice, with musketry and sword;
And now he has improved so much, the nations all do yield,
They know ’twill never do to meet him on the battle field.

5. Old Uncle Sam now has a felon on his Southern thumb,
Which makes that Southern arm quite sore, but not the least bit numb;
The remedy which he applies, gets better every day:
’Twill heal that felon by and by and drive the cause away!

CHORUS 5. 
Hurrah! hurrah! strike down _all other_ types,
And hoist on high our glorious Flag that bears the Stars and Stripes.
