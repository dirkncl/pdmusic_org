1.
My love is on the battle field,
The traitor foe before him,
His hand is firm, his heart is true,
The Stars and Stripes o'er him.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
God grant that when the fight is done,
The cry shall be, our cause has won,
 God grant that when the fight is done,
 The cry shall be, our cause has won.

2.
My soul is in the battle's din,
For there are hope and glory;
And though the Union ranks may thin,
They'll live in Freedom's story.

3.
My love is in the battle's front,
Oh! may no ill betide him;
But rather than a coward fall,
I'd perish there beside him.
