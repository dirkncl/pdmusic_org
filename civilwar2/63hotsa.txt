"Harp of the South Awake!" (1863)
A Southern War Song.
Words by J. M. Kilgoth
Music by C. L. Peticolas

1.
Harp of the South, awake!
From ev'ry golden wire,
Let the voice of thy power go forth,
Like the rush of the prairie fire;
With the rush and the rhythm of a power,
That dares a freeman's grave,
Rather than [fire?] in [war?]
The [shame?] of a [touching?] slave.

CHORUS
Harp of the South, awake!
  And strike the strain once more
Which nerv'd the heroes' hearts
  In the glorious days of yore.

2.
Harp of the South, awake!
  Thy sons are aroused at last,
And their legions are gathering now
  To the sound of the Trumpet blast;
To the scream of the piercing Fire,
  And the beat of the rolling drum,
From maintain, and hill, and plain,
  And field, and [moor?], they come.

(CHORUS)

3.
Harp of the South, awake!
  Their [?] are on the breeze;
Tell the world bow vain the thought,
  To subdue such men as these--
With hero hearts that beat
  To the throbs of the spirit-flame,
Which will kindle their battle-fires
  In Freedom's holy name.

(CHORUS)

4.
Harp of the South, awake!
  Though the soldier's burning tear
May fall on thy tremling strings,
  As he breathes his farewell prayer;
Yet tell him how to die
  On the bloody battle-field,
Rather than to her foes
  The gallant South should yield.

(CHORUS)
