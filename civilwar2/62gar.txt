1. I’m sitting by thy grave tonight,
I’m weeping, weeping bitter tears;
For ah stern sorrow’s withering flight
Hath dimm’d the hope, hath dimm’d the hope of years;
The smile hath vanished from my brow,
My heart is sad today;
The world is dark and lovely now,
My Gentle, my gentle Annie Ray.

CHORUS (ad lib.) [sung after each VERSE]
The smile has vanished from my brow,
My heart is sad today,
The world is dark and lonely now,
My gentle, my gentle Annie Ray.

2. The light wind sighs around thy tomb,
The gentle willows o’er thee weep!
The summer flow’rs in beauty bloom
Where thou art laid, where thou art laid to sleep;
In angel form and sweeter strain
Now call my soul away I know in heav’n I’ll meet again,
My Gentle, my gentle Annie Ray.
