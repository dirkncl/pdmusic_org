1. God of our fathers bless the land,
We hold from them and Thee,
Stretch forth through rolling years the hand,
That made to keep us free!
Oh keep us free!
In the world’s onward march grant Thou
Our nation lead the van,
Foremost in right and righteousness,
In love to God and man.

CHORUS 1-3.
God keep our States, United States,
One nation of the free!
God save the grand old Stars and Stripes,
Of blood bought liberty!

2. Like some great temple arch’d and dom’d
And many colum’d— rise
Sacred as evry hous of God,
Thou Union to the skies!
Oh keep us free!
As thine own rugged rockbound coasts,
Resist the oceans rage,
Stand thou gainst earth’s embattled hosts,
Unmov’d from age to age.

3. Firm as the earth’s foundations rest 
The pillars of our state,
Based on those virtues which alone
Make men and nations great!
Oh keep us free!
So shall that sacred bond sublime,
Which binds these States in one,
Resist the stormy shock of time,
And stand while shines the sun.
