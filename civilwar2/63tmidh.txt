1.
I am dying, comrades dying,
  As you hear me lightly tread
Soon ah soon I shall be lying
  With the silent sleeping dead
I am dying comrades dying
  Still the battle rages near,
Tell me are our foes a flying,
  I die happy mother dear.

CHORUS
Tell me mother I die happy,
  That for me she must not weep,
Tell her how I long'd to kiss her,
  Ere I sank in death to sleep.

2.
I am going, comrades going,
  See how damp my foreheard's now---
Oh, I see the angels coming,
  With bright garlands for my brow.
Rear this message to my mother,
  How in death that God was near,
He to bless and to support me---
  I die happy mother dear.

(CHORUS)

3.
Lay me comrades, 'neath the willow,
  That grows on the distand shore.
Wrap the starry flag around me,
  I would press its folds once more.
Let the cold earth be my pillow,
  And the "Stars and Stripes" my shroud,
Soon, oh soon I shall be marching,
  Amid the heavenly crowd.

(CHORUS)
