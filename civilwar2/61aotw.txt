1. A Nation’s wrongs, upon its sons press’d hard,
And for redress each manly heart was beating;
In strife each sturdy yoeman’s arm was bared,
And North and South our warlike bands were meeting 
Our Country sought a Chief, and one was found:
Whose name was then untold, scarce known in story;
Whose brow by honor’s wreath was only bound—
’Twas Washington, our pride, our boast, our glory!
’Twas Washington, our pride, our boast, our glory!

2. The first in battle and the first in peace,
His sword th’usurping foe for ever dreaded;
He led the van, he bade the turmoil cease,
His voice our Nation’s councils ever heeded.
The people call’d him Father, and each child
Was taught to bless the name renown’d in story;
And e’en the savage in his forest wild,
Call’d Washington, our pride, our boast, our glory!
Call’d Washington, our pride, our boast, our glory!

3. The strife is o’er, his rest the warrior seeks,
Upon his pillow, calmly he reposes;
His lips move slowly, faintly now he speaks,
A whisper’d pray’r, in death his sight now closes.
“I’ve serv’d my country, and the God I own;
Our cause was just, ’rwill be renown’d in story,
And now I go to serve my God alone.”
Thus died our Nation’s pride, our boast and glory!
Thus died our Nation’s pride, our boast and glory!
