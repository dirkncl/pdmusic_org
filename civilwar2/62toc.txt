"The 
Old Chieftain" (1862)
Song and Chorus. 

Old Abe Lincoln is the man for me,
However long or less he may be,
He's honest and bold, he never fails,
He knows how to fight, and split oak-rails.

  Old Abe Lincoln is the man for me,
  Old Abe Lincoln is the man for me,
  Old Abe Lincoln is the man for all,
  He can whip old Jeff and old Stonewall.

1. Old Abe  Lincoln is the man for me, 
However long or lean he may be, 
He’s honest and bold, he never fails, 
He knows how to fight and split oak rails.

2. When old Abe puts his foot to the ground, 
It sticks right fast and never turns round, 
He hears what the others have to say 
And then goes on to his good old way.

3. He cracks his jokes and he makes us smile, 
But he’s in earnest all the while, 
They say that he has a narrow soul, 
But it can take in the Union Whole.

4. He seem to do what he always said,
He sticks to the notions in his head.
The good old Union must stay just so,
For it won't do to break it in two.

5. The proclamation the last and the best,
Is liked firstrate both east and west,
But Richmond gets quite red in the face,
To learn of the Nigger’s day of grace.

6. God bless the old man and all his folks,
Secesh will find out that he’s not a hoax,
He’s soft in words but he’s hard in blows,
He can whip whoever may oppose.

Old Abe Lincoln is the man for me, 
Old Abe Lincoln is the man for thee; 
Old Abe Lincoln is the man for all, 
He can whip old Jeff and old Stonewall.
