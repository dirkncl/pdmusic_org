1.
O'er Columbia's blest land, mid the glory of peace,
Deep murmurs of discord arise;
The clamor of battle is bourne on the breeze,
Lo! the Toesin notes peirce the blue skies!

CHORUS
Fair Liberty's guardian, still jealous of right
From the bright realms of bliss, to earth takes her flight,
The Godess of celestial attention commands!
As she summons her sons, mid the sectional bands.

2.
How radiant with hope, stands America's Queen,
Eye beaming with Love's holy fire,
As she waves to the front her triumphant "Thirteen,"
Led by sons of thrice laurel crowd'd sire!

CHORUS
Through the gorgeous striped folds of her star glit'ring vest,
Impassion'd affection upheaves her fond breast,
WIth Laurel twined Olive extended in hand,
An of'fring of peace to each sectional band.

3.
The stern braves of the _North_ in order arrayed,
The _East_ with her yeomen of steel.
_South's_ patriot sons, in proud strength undismay'd
Stalwart giants of the _West_ in line wheel!

CHORUS
"Ambition attained,
With prosperity vain.
Would my patriot sons blast their birth right with shame!
Shall the sword of fell anarchy raise brothers' hand,
Or the corden of Love bind each sectional band.

4.
While the nation's of earth, for the gift ye despise
Would deluge the soil with their life,
From the hoof of foul tyranny groan to arise,
Shall freemen meet freemen in stife.

CHORUS
Though Despots applaud, and Monarchs delight,
At the downfall of freedom in Liberty's flight.
_True strength is in Union_ of hearts and of hands,
WOn by Patriots united not sectional bands."

5.
Brave sons of Columbia! 'tis Liberty pleads
_For our Union bright beacon of light,_
Shades of hallowed martyrs to valorous deeds,
From high Heaven cry sons severed unite!

CHORUS
Breast to breast as our fathers, ranks solid as one,
The hope of the sire still the pride of the son.
The glory of ages our Union shall stand,
For our _Union_ we'll _rally_ each sectional band.
