1. QUARTETTE
Long our land in blood had weltered,
Blood of dearest sons;
Long had Hero— Spirits faltered,
Not at booming guns:
Long our pray’r to Heav’n ascended
Fraught with bondmen’s groans;
Long with vict’ry’s cheers had blended
Fettered manhood’s means!
CHORUS 1
God hath heard us,
God hath heard us, and in mercy
Gives us bread for stones.
God hath heard us,
God hath heard us, and in mercy
Gives us bread for stones.

2. QUARTETTE
Asking for a Land, for a Land united,
We forget the slave.
Pray’d we for our Country, for our Country blighted—
For our falling brave,—
Left the bondman, chased by blood hounds
Scented thro’ the cane,—
God was with that panting brother;
Pray’d we thus in vain!
CHORUS 2
Ask, as we would serve another,
Ask, and he will hear again!
Ask, as we would serve another,
Ask, and he well hear again!

3. QUARTETTE
He hath heard; O give Him glory!
Heard the Bondman’s pray’r:
O’er the war path, red and gory
Thro’ the slavehound’s lair,
Peals the mandate of salvation,
“Let my people go.”
Humbled, bleeding, hear the nation
Answer “Be it so!”
CHORUS 3
Who shall weary!
Who shall weary! who shall falter!
God is with us now!
Who shall weary!
Who shall weary! who shall falter!
God is with us now!
