1. America! Home of the free!
To the star of thy liberties bright,
Turn the eyes of the millions who flee,
For a rescue from tyranny’s night!
Tho’ thy magical name and thy ensign unfurl’d,
May enkindle some envy with joy in the world,
Yet the orbs of thy Union shall glow through all time,
While the nations of earth
Own thy splendor sublime!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O Columbia’s Banner, the Flag of the Free,
Shall be honor’d for aye, o’er the Land and the Sea!

2. Columbia’s! Queen of the land!
From the heart of the nation, her throne,
She proclaims this benignant command:
“Let the will of the people be known!
They are free from the scouge of oppression’s fell rod;
They are free evermore in the worship of God!
And the ensign that beams o’er the land of my birth,
Shall a welcome fling out
For the bond of the earth!

3. America! Home of the free!
Tis thy dear starry emblem that holds,
The enchantment that binds us to thee—
All our fortunes to thine— in its folds!
On the wretch who its lustre or glory would pall
Shall the fury and vengence of patriots fall!
Yes, thy flag shall be sacred whereever unfurl’d,
Amd shall awe ev’ry traitor and foe in the world!
