1. He is my boy, my only boy!
his father died long years gone by;
and little have I known of joy,
but gazing on his dark blue eye,
’Tis lighted now with higher glow,
his country calls him; let him go!
his country calls him; let him go.

2. He never grieved me; tender, kind,
strong, loving full of hope and grace—
my life was in his own entwined,
my heart but mirrored back his face,
With stern resolve he seeks the foe;
his country calls him; let him go!
his country calls him; let him go.

3. How often I have set beside
him sleeping, clustering round his head
those rich brown locks, my praise, my pride!
and soon the earth must be his bed.
’Tis wrong to grieve for this I know
his country calls him; let him go!
his country calls him; let him go.

4. Ah, in how many hearts this strife
is waged in prayer by prayer is won!
there is the wood, the fire, the knife
and for this sacrifice our son!
’Twould kiss me if he fell; but no!
his country calls him; let him go!
his country calls him; let him go.
