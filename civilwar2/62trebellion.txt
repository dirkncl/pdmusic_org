1.
The Rebels took Sumter from Uncle Sam,
The Rebels took Sumter from Uncle Sam,
The Rebels took Sumter from Uncle Sam;
Not by Right but by Might.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
Glory, Glory Hallelujah!
The Right it must prevail!

2.
At Bull Run they fought, but soon they fled,
At Bull Run they fought, but soon they fled,
At Bull Run they fought, but soon they fled,
The “mudsills” were at them.

3.
Reinforced by Johnston, they gained the day,
Reinforced by Johnston, they gained the day,
Reinforced by Johnston, they gained the day,
Yet they dared not go on.

4.
In skirmish they gained, in skirmish they lost;
In skirmish they gained, in skirmish they lost;
In skirmish they gained, in skirmish they lost;
No decisive battle won.

5.
Dupont and Sherman take the field and win;
Dupont and Sherman take the field and win;
Dupont and Sherman take the field and win;
Port Royal now is ours.

6.
A fire is kindled by General Burnside,
A fire is kindled by General Burnside,
A fire is kindled by General Burnside,
It soon will rage and roar.

7.
We Grant them a Foote, they cry “Enough,”
We Grant them a Foote, they cry “Enough,”
We Grant them a Foote, they cry “Enough,”
And Floyd and Pillow run.

8.
“Seccession is a failure,” now they say;
“Secession is a failure,” now they say;
“Secession is a failure,” now they say;
The Union yet must stand.

9.
The Stars and Stripes o’er all the land shall wave,
The Stars and Stripes o’er all the land shall wave,
The Stars and Stripes o’er all the land shall wave,
’Mid peace and Liberty
