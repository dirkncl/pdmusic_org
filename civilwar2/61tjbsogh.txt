1. Oh, John Brown’s body lies a mould’ring in the grave,
While weep the sons of bondage whom he ventured all to save;
But tho’ he lost his life in struggling for the slave,
His soul is marching on.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Oh glory hallelujah

2. John Brown was a hero undaunted, true and brave;
Kansas knew his valor when he fought her rights to save;
And now tho’ the grass grows green above his grave,
His soul is marching on.

3. He captured Harpers Ferry, with his nineteen men so few,
And he frighten’d “Old Virginny” ’till she trembled thro’ and thro’;
They hung him for a traitor, themselves a traitor crew,
But his soul is marching on.

4. John Brown was John the Baptist for the Christ we are to see—
Christ who of the bondman shall the Liberator be;
And soon throughout the sunny south, the slaves shall all be free,
For his soul is marching on.

5. The conflict that he heralded, he looks from heav’n to view;
On the army of the Union with its flag red, white and blue,
And heaven shall ring with anthems o’er the deeds they mean to do,
For his soul is marching on.

6. O soldiers of freedom, then strike while strike you may
The deathblow of oppression in a better time and way;
For the dawn of old John Brown has brighten’d into day,
And his soul is marching on.
