1. Stand by the banner of the free!
Protect our nation’s worth;
Defend the home of liberty,
The spot of Freedom’s birth;
The pride of honest, manly hearts,
The hope of all the world;
The hope of all the world;
In triumph let our glorious Flag,
To heaven be unfurled,
To heaven let Columbia’s Flag
In triumph beunfurled.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then a  rousing cheer for the flag of the free,
God bless each stripe and star,
We’ll bear it on to victory,
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

2. When trait’rous foes our rights invade,
And seek our country’s shame;
With braggart lips defiance hurl,
And treason loud proclaim,
Rise! freeborn millions of the North!
In majesty and might,
In majesty and might!
March fearlessly, yet calmly forth,
And battle for the right!
March fearlessly, yet calmly forth,
And batAnd battle for the right!

3. Mark well the cause for which you fight,
Union and Liberty!
With heart and hand let all unite
And swear “we will be free!”
By blood of soldier patriots slain,
By mem’ries of the past,
By mem’ries of the past;
Stand by the Flag! and bear it on
To victory at last!
Stand by the Flag! and bear it on
To vicTo victory at last!

4. And when sweet Peace unfolds her wings
O’er all this glorious land,
May North and South, may East and West,
Free and united stand,
And may the blessings nobly won,
Endure from age to age,
Endure from age to age;
Peace, Union, Justice, Liberty,
A priceless heritage,
Peace, Union Justice, Liberty,
A priceless heritage.
