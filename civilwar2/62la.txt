Laura Anna
Written & Composed by W.C. Baker (1862)

I.
In a ? beside the river ; ? = can't read lyric :(
Where the waters gently flow,
While they murmur sweetest music all the day.
There I met my Laura Anna,
And we parted long ago,
And I wander'd sad and lonely for away,
And I wander'd sad and lonely far away.

Chorus
Oh, she was all the world to me,
My Laura kind and true;
And when I dream of happy days,
I fondly dream of you.
And when I dream of happy days,
I fondly dream of you.

II.
There we roamed the fields together,
And the hours flew swiftly by
While we talked of future pleasures bright and gay.
And I wondered why we lingered
Thus beneath a summer sky
And I wandered sad and lonely far away.
And I wandered sad and lonely far away.

Repeat Chorus
