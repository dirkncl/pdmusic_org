1.
Dead on the battle field!
The bravest of the brave,
In the foremost ranks he nobly fought
And found a soldier's grave,
His country mourns his loss,
A nation o'er him weeps
But glory gilds the honor'd name
Our fond remembrance keeps.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dead on the battle field!
The braves of the brave,
In the foremost ranks he nobly fought
And found a soldier's grave.

2.
Dead on the battle field!
In the cause of truth and right,
He stood resolved to triumph there
Or perish in the fight.
The lifeblood of his heart--
With purpose pure and high,
He freely shed his in his country's cause
When summoned thus to die.

3.
Dead on the battle field!
The hero's thrilling voice,
No more shall bid the traitor fear,
The loyal heart rejoice,
In the cold embrace of death
The gallant soldier sleeps,
But glory gilds his honor'd tomb
And the nation o'er him weeps.
