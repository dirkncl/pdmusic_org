1. Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight, 
Make me a child again, just for tonight! 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore.
Take me again to your heart as of yore. 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care. 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair. 
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse,
and before each CHORUS]
Rock me to sleep mother, rock me to sleep. 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

CHORUS 1 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care. 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair. 
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep. 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

2. Over my heart, in days that are flown, 
No love like mother’s love ever has shown; 
No other worship abides  and endures, 
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours. 
None like a mother can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world weary brain; 
Slumber’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep. 

CHORUS 2 
None like a mother can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world weary brain; 
Slumber’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep. 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

3. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted by gold,
Fall on your shoulder, again as of old;
Let it over my forehead tonight,
Shading my faint eyes away from the light,
For with the sunnyedged shadows once more,
Sweetly will throng the clear visions of yore.
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sleep;
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

CHORUS 3
3. For with the sunnyedged shadows once more,
Sweetly will throng the clear visions of yore.
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sleep;
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

4. Mother, dear mother, the years have been long
Since I last hushed to your lullaby song;
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem,
My manhood’s years have been but a dream;
Clasp me to your arms in a loving embrace,
With your bright lashes just sweeping my face,
Never, hereafter, to wake or to weep;
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.

CHORUS 4
Clasp me to your arms in a loving embrace,
With your bright lashes just sweeping my face,
Never, hereafter, to wake or to weep;
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.
