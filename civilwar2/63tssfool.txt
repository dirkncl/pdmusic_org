1. The flag that our fathers fought under,
Is the joy and the pride of the land,
’Tis tbe gems of ours, Army and Navy,
When born by their Loyal true bands,
Up, up with fair Liberty’s Standard.
It floats for Justice and Right,
The stars that bespangle our banner,
Old time will but render more bright.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Oh, the Star Spangled Flag of our Land,
The dear Union Flag of our Land,
The Flag of our Union forever,
The Star Spangled Flag of our Land.

2. The legacy that Washington left us,
Pure freedom will cherish for aye,
No ensign of tyranny o’er us,
No despot his scepter shall sway,
While we live we will keep it high flying,
And fight till the death hand in hand,
For the Flag of this Union forever,
The Star Spangled Flag of our Land.
