An Anthem
Written and Composed by

1.
God save the South,
God save the South,
Her altars and firesides,
God save the South!

God save the South,
God save the South,
Her altars and firesides,
God save the South!

Now that the war is nigh,
Now that we are to die,
Chanting our battle cry,
Freedom or Death!
Chanting our battle cry,
Freedom or Death!

2.
God be our shield,
At home or afield,
Stretch thine arm over us,
Strengthen and save.

God be our shield,
At home or afield,
Stretch thine arm over us,
Strengthen and save.

What tho' they're three to one,
Forward each sire and son,
Strike till the war is won,
Strike to the grave!
Strike till the war is won,
Strike to the grave!

3.
God make the right,
Stronger than _might_,
Millions would trample us
Down in their pride.

God make the right,
Stronger than _might_,
Millions would trample us
Down in their pride.

Lay _Thou_ their legions low,
Roll back the ruthless foe,
Let the proud spoiler know
God's on our side.
Let the proud spoiler know
God's on our side.

4.
Hark honor's call,
Summoning all,
Summoning all of us
Unto the strife.

Hark honor's call,
Summoning all,
Summoning all of us
Unto the strife.

Sons of the south awake!
Strike till the brand shall break,
Strike for dear Honor's sake,
Freedom and Life!
Strike for dear Honor's sake,
Freedom and Life!

5.
_Rebels_ before
Our father's of yore,
_Rebel's_ the righteous name
_Washington_ bore.

_Rebels_ before
Our father's of yore,
_Rebel's_ the righteous name
_Washington_ bore.

Why, then, be our's the same,
The name that he snatch'd from shame,
Making it first in fame,
Foremost in war.
Making it first in fame,
Foremost in war.

6.
War to the hilt,
Their's be the guilt,
Who fetter the free man
To ransom the slave.

War to the hilt,
Their's be the guilt,
Who fetter the free man
To ransom the slave.

Up, then, and undismay'd,
Sheathe not the battle blade
Till the last foe is laid
Low in the grave!
Till the last foe is laid
Low in the grave!

7.
God save the South,
God save the South,
Dry the dim eyes that now
Follow our path.

God save the South,
God save the South,
Dry the dim eyes that now
Follow our path.

Still let the light feet rove
Safe through the orange grove;
Still keep the land we love
Safe from _Thy_ wrath.
Still keep the land we love
Safe from _Thy_ wrath.

8.
God save the South,
God save the South,
Her altars and firesides,
God save the South!

God save the South,
God save the South,
Her altars and firesides,
God save the South!

For thou great war is nigh,
And we will win or die,
Chanting our battle cry,
Freedom or death!
Chanting our battle cry,
Freedom or death!
