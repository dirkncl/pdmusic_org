1. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Is’t Maryland? Virgin ia land?
Is’t where Potomac’s rushing tide
Swift through the mountain gorge doth glide?
Ah! no, no, no!
Greater by far that land I trow,
Greater by far that land I trow.

2. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Is’t Jersey land? Missouri land?
Is’t where the changing sea fowl scream?
Where rolls the Missisippi’s stream?
Ah! no, no, no!
Greater by far that land I trow.
Greater by far that land I trow.

3. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Is’t Eastern land? Is’t Western land?
Is’t where the granite mountains rise?
Is’t where the flowery prairie lies?
Ah! no, no, no!
Greater by far that land I trow.
Greater by far that land I trow.

4. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Is’t middle land? Is’t border land?
Is’t where the iron from forges glow?
Is’t where primeval forests grow?
Ah, no, no, no!
Greater by far that land I trow.
Greater by far that land I trow.

5. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Name to me, then, the glorious land!
Is’t where the snow white plant expands?
Is’t California’s golden sands?
Ah, no, no, no!
Greater by far that land I trow.
Greater by far that land I trow.

6. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Is’t where once stood a noble hand,
The freedom we enjoy to gain,
On Bunker’s height or Euaw’s pain?
Ah! no, no no!
Greater by far that land I trow.
Greater by far that land I trow.

7. What is the Patriot’s Fatherland?
Name then, at last, the glorious land,
Wheree’er the starry flag doth wave,
North, South, East, West, that land we have,
What should it be, what should it be,
True Fatherland to you and me,
True Father­land to you and me. 

8. The whole should be our Fatherland
Unsevered by the traitor’s hand,
Unshaken by fanatic zeal,
Where all shall seek the common weal.
That shall it be that shall it be,
True Fatherland to you and me,
True Father­land to you and me.
