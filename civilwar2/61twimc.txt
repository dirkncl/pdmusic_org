1. Know ye that honest Abraham,
So loyal, brave and true,
Will bring our Union back again,
And Freedom with it too;
He understands our nation’s needs,
And knowing, will not fail
To cleave the rebel monarchy,
As he would split a rail!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
We sing to those it may concern,
That we are ever true
To those who battle for the flag
Of red and white and blue.

2. What though the haughty foe shall lose
Its grasp on every slave,—
Far better, than that Liberty
Should find our soil its grave;
We care not if in fighting for
The land, by right, our own,—
The tyrant loses ev’ry serf,
The despot e‘en his throne!

3. We’re crossing foul Rebellion’s stream,
And breakers dash around,
We have a welltried captain now,
Who knows where peace is found;
We must not trust our creaking ship
To those who idly dream,
’Twill never do to “swap our horse”
Till we have crossed the stream!

4. So gather round his standard now,
And aid him all you can,
Though you may look both far and near,
You’’ll find no better man;
God guide his true and willing heart,
Till Treason’s reign shall cease,
And may the God who rules o’er all,
Soon bring us lasting peace!
