Respectfully Dedicated to
Robert Morris, Esq.
"King Cotton" (1863)

King Cotton, we've heard of they fame,
  And gladly would learn of thee more;
Now, say from what region you came;
  How high would your majesty soar?
Say, where have you plant-ed your throne;
  How far does your kingdom extend;
And art thou supreme and alone,
  To whom all nations most bend?

1. King Cotton, we’ve heard of thy fame,
And gladly would learn of thee more;
Now, say from what region you came,
How high would your majesty some?
Say, where have you planted your throne,
How far does your kingdom extend,
And art thou supreme and alone,
To whom all the nations must bend?
  And art thou supreme and alone,
  To whom all the nations must bend?

2. King Cotton, are thou the fair plant,
Which wealth to our nation doth bring?
And dost thou so freely now grant,
The right thus to claim thee as king?
The King then replied with a smile,
I have neither kingdom nor throne;
I’m lowly and modest in style,
And rais’d by the darkies alone.
  I’m lowly and modest in style,
  And rais’d by the darkies alone.

3. But if I am claim’d as a king,
By some of the fanciful South;
They hope for the aid I may bring,
I’m crushing the strength of the North.
The ridicule rests not on me,
But those that have set up their claim;
Who wish from the North to be free,
And gain as a nation high fame.
  Who wish from the North to be free.
  And gain as a nation high fame.
