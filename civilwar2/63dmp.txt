1. Oh hear I am again
How are you gentlemen, just listen unto me,
And I’ll tell you in my song
’Bought things I do like and dont like to see.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
But I would like to see the white folks make their quarrels up,
And  let the Niggers be,
For Slave or Free, a nigger will be a nigger,
Dat’s my Philosophy.

2. Oh I dont like to see
Dis great country broke up through party strife,
But I would like to see
De white folks friends on equal terms, and seek each others life.

3. Oh I dont like to see
Good men and True, contending in their might,
But I would like to see
De men who caused all dis trouble shov’d foremost in dis fight.
