1. Hurrah for the South, the glorious South,
The land of song and story!
Her name shall ring, and the world shall sing,
Her honor, fame, and glory!
For the skies above that have smil’d in love
Are dark with heartfires burning;
She rises in might to defend the right,
On her treach’rous brethren turning.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sons of the South, arise! arise!
For NEVER shall fall upon her,
The land we love all the earth above,
One stain of dark dishonor.

2. Hurrah for the South! the gallant South!
with her great heart proudly beating,
She takes her stand at Freedom’s hand,
And dreams not of retreating.
No! Southern boys for their fireside joys,
With their hearts so broke and tender,
Will relentlessly fight, and to death’s dark night
Alone will they surrender.

3. No North thern hand shall rule this land!
To the breeze give Freedom’s banner!
As its  glowing folds o’er our land unrolls,
From mountain and savannah,
O’er river and lake the sound shall break,
And swell with thundering glory.
Hurrah for the South! the Noble South!
The land of war and story.
