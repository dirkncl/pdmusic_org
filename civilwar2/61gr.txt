Southern Song

Brightest   Stiegelli.
Gently Rest   Ku[:]cken
Listen to the Mocking Bird   Hawthorne.
Chimes of the Monastery   do.
On the Mountain's airy Summit   Ku[:]cken.
Shells of the Ociean
Sleeping I Dream Love

Softly ye night winds
Vale of rest   Nelson.
Will you Love me than as now
Dearest then I'll love you more
When I saw sweet Nellie Home
Gentle Nettie Moore

1. Gently rest! the night stars gleam
Soft thy slumber, bright thy dream.
Fear no harm, for I will keep
Watch with love while thou’rt asleep;
Watch with love while thou’rt asleep
Oh! hush thee now in slumber mild;
  While watch I keep; Oh! sleep my child.

2. Let but Angels whispering tell
In thy soft dream where they dwell;
In that land where no decay
Steals the flowers they love away.
Ah! hath thee now in slumber mild,
While watch I keep; Oh! sleep my Child.
  While watch I keep; Oh! sleep my Child.

3. Ah! ’twere vain to tell thee now
Of the love my heart can know,
Only now for thee I pine,
All a mother’s love is thine.
Oh! hush thee now in slumber mild,
While watch I keep; Oh! sleep my Child.
  While watch I keep; Oh! sleep my Child.
