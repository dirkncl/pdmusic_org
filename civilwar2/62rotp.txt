1. The drumtap rattles thro’ the land, 
The trumpet calls to arms. 
A startled Nation stands aghast, 
Unused to war’s alarms! 
Ho! watchman on the outer wall! 
What danger do you see? 
||: “To arms, to arms!” the sentry cries, 
“To arms, if you’d be free!” :||

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
To arms, to arms! the sentry cries, 
To arms, if you’d be free! 
To arms, to arms! the sentry cries, 
To arms, if you’d be free!

2. Hark! heard you not that booming gun?
’Twas aim’d at Sumter’s walls!
To arms, to arms! the cry speeds on,—
To arms! or Freedom falls!
For on those walls our Banner floats,
Assail’d by traiter band;
||: To arms, to arms! a Nation shouts
To arms, for Freedom stand! :||

3. They come, they come with patriot seal,
From workshop, stor and farm;
Resolv’d to save their Country’s Flag,
And traitor foes disarm!
Like ocean’s roar their voices swell
From plain to mountain crag;—
||: Union and Liberty they cry:
One Country and One Flag! :||

4. With gath’ring strength they onward march,
Their Country’s Flag to shield;
Its starry folds they bear aloft
On many a battle field!
They stand as once our Fathers stood,
They scorn from foe to fly,
||: For Freedom and Columbia’s Flag
They conquer or they die! :||

5. God speed our noble, gallant band
Of heroes, true and brave;
March on, march on! till o’er our land
The Stripes and Stars shall wave!
Great God of battles— bless our cause,
Bring Peace from War’s alarms!
||: Protect and guide us by Thy Might,
’Till Vict’ry Crowns our Arms! :||
