1.
O, wrap the flag around me, boys,
To die were far more sweet,
With Freedom's starry emblem, boys,
To be my winding sheet,
In life I lov'd to see it wave,
And follow where it led,
And now my eyes grow dim, my hands
Would clasp its last bright shred.

CHORUS
Then wrap the flag around me boys,
To die were fare more sweet,
With Freedom's starry emblem, boys,
To be my winding sheet.

2.
O, I had thought to greet you, boys,
On many a well won field,
When to our starry banner, boys,
The trait'rous foe should yield;
But now, alas! I am denied
My dearest earthly pray'r---
You'll follow and you'll meet the foe,
But I shall not be there.

CHORUS
Yet weep, &c.

3.
But though my body moulder, boys,
My spirit will be free,
And every comrade's honer, boys,
Will still be dear to me.
There, in the thick and bloody fight
Ne'er let your ardor lag,
For I'll be there still hov'ring near,
Above the dear old flag.

CHORUS
So wrap the flag [etc.]
