1. Freedom! give us Freedom,
  For our battle call and cry;
’Tis a nation’s heart, that’s pleading,
  Heed the echoes ere they die.
Freedom! give us Freedom,
  The oppress’d in bondage sigh,
And the pray’e is heard resounding,
  Throu’ the arches of the sky.

CHORUS 1-4.
Freedom, sing of Freedom,
  And swell the chorus high,
’Tis the only watchword worthy,
  To be our battle cry.

2. Freedom! give us Freedom,
  For our battle song and cry,
And thoujgh our strife be fearful,
  Our hope shall never die.
Freedom! give us Freedom,
  ’Tis the birthright, of the brave,
It will cheer them on while living,
  And glorify the grave.

3. Freedom! Ay give Freedom.
  To every human soul,
And our Coumtry’s star ascemding,
  Shall reach a shimimg goal.
Freedom! strike for Freedom,
  And the God who rules on high,
Will lead our valiant armies
  On, on to victory. 

4. Freedom! sing of Freedom,
  Let it be our nation’s hymn,
Till the hosts of heaven shall hear it,
  And the flame of Mars grow dim.
Freedom! sing of Freedom,
  ’Tis the anthem of the world,
And with the songs ascending,
  Let our banners be unfurled.
