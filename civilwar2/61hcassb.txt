1. Hail, Columbia, happy land!
Hail ye Heroes, heav’n born band,
Who fought and bled in Freedom’s cause,
Who fought and bled in Freedom’s cause,
And when the storm of war was gone,
Enjoy’d the peace your valor won.
Let Independence be our boast,
Ever mindful what it cost,
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its altar reach the sky.

CHORUS 1-2.
Firm united let us be Rallying round our Liberty;
As a band of Brothers join, Peace and safety we shall find.

2. Immortal Patriots rise once more,
Defend your rights, defend your shore;
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Invade the shrine where sacred lies,
Of toil and blood the well earn’d prize!
While off’ring peace sincere and just,
In Heav.n we place a manly trust,
That truth and justice may prevail,
And ev’ry scheme of bondage fail.

3. Sound, sound the trump of fame,
Let Washington’s great name!
Ring thro’ the world with loud applause;
Ring thro’ the world with loud applause;
Let ev’ry clime to freedom dear,
Listen with a joyful ear;
With equal skill with godlike pow’r,
He govern’d in the fearful hour;
Of horrid war or guides with ease,
The happier times of honest peace.

4. Behold the Chief who now commands,
Once more to serve his country stands!
The rock on which the storm will beat;
The rock on which the storm will beat;
But arm’d in virtue firm and true,
His hopes are fix’d on heav’n and you;
When hope was sinking in dismay,
And gloom obscur’d Columbias day,
His steady mind from chambers free,
Resolv’d on death or Liberty.
