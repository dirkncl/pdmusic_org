1. Down where the patriot array
Near Potomac’s side,
Guards the glorious cause of freedom
Gallant Ellsworth died.
Brave was the noble chieftain:
At his count try’s call.
Hasten’d to the field of battle,
And was first to fall.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Strike freemen, for the Union!
Sheathe your swords no more
While remains in arms a traitor
On Columbia’s shore!

2. Entering the traitor city
With his soldiers true,
Leading up the Zouave column,
Fix’d became his view.
“See that Rebel flag is floating
O’er yon building tall;”
Spoke he, while his dark eye glisten’d;
“Boys that flag MUST fall!”

3. Quickly from its proud position,
That base flag was torn,
Trampled ’neath the feet of freemen,
Circling Ellsworth’s form;
See him bear it down the landing,
Past the traitor’s door,
Hear him groan! Oh, God they shot him!
Ellsworth is no more!

4. First to fall, thou youthful martyr,
Hapless was thy fate;
Hasten we as thy avengers
From thy native state.
Speed we on, from town and city,
Not for wealth or fame,
But because we love the Union,
And our Ellsworth’s name.

5. Traitors hands shall never sunder
That for which you died,
Hear the oath our lips now utter,
Thou our nation’s pride.
By our hopes of yon bright heaven,
By the land we love,
By the God who reigns above us,
We’ll avenge thy blood.
