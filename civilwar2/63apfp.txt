1. Ruler of Earth and Sky!
Hear Thou our earnest cry—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.
Look at us with tenderness,
And aid us in our distress,
Our bleeding Country bless;
Our bleeding Country bless;—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.

2. Our bark, by tempest toss’d,
Without Thy aid is lost—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.
Shield us from further harm,
O quell the fearful storm,
Stretch forth Thy mighty arm,
Stretch forth Thy mighty arm,
  And bid it cease.
  And bid it cease.

3. Stay, stay the battle-shock!
Dispel war’s dread siroc—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.
Let no more balls be sped,
Let no more blood be shed,
Let no more blood be red;
Let no more fields be red;—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.

4. To weeping homes once more,
Husbands and sons restore—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.
Let the warwasted plain,
With plenty smile again,
Let love and concord reign—
Let love and concord reign—
  God give us peace.
  God give us peace.

5. Then shall our land rejoice,
And ev’ry gladsome voice—
  Hosanna, peace.
  Hosanna, peace.
While grareful hearts shall sing,
And hill and valley ring,
Thy praise Almighty King—
Thy praise Almighty King—
  God give us peace.
  God give us Peace.
