1. Hark! to the trumpet shrill calling.
It pierceth the soft summer air,
Tears from each Zouave are falling,
For the brave gallant Ellsworth is there.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
The bayonets earthward are turning,
And the drums muffled breath rolls a round.
But he hears not the voice of their mourning,
Nor awakes to the bugles sound.

2. Sleep Soldier! now a nation mourns thee,
The first to depart to the fray.
Long ere that nation shall forget thee,
Or thy name from the earth pass away,

3. Sleep Hero, thy country did call thee,
It needed the true, and the brave,
Why? did this evil befall thee,
Why shrouded thy form for the grave.
