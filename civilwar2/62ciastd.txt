1. Oh, do not stand so long outside,
Why need you be so shy?
The people’s eyes are open, John,
As they are passing by;
You cannot tell what they may think,
They’ve said strange things before;
And if your want to talk awhile,
Come in and shut the door.
  And if you want to talk awhile,
  Come in and shut the door.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Come in, (come in,) come in, (come in,)
come in, (come in,) come in and shut the door,
Come in, (come in,) come in, (come in,)
come in, (come in,) come in and shut the door.

2. Nay, do not say, “no thank you Jane,”
With such a bashful smile,—
You said when ladies whisper’d “no,”
They meant “yes,” all the while!
My Father, too, will welcome you,—
I told you that before;
It does’n't look well standing here,
Come in and shut the door.
  It doesn’t look well standing here,
  Come in and shut the door.

3. You said I did not answer you
To what was said last night;
I heard your question in the dark,
Thought on it in the light;
And now my lips shall utter what
My heart has said before,
Yes, dearest, I— but, stay awhile—
Come in and shut the door.
  Yes, dearest, I— but, stay awhile—
  Come in and shut the door.
