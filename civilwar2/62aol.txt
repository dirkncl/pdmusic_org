1.
Anthem of Liberty,
Solemn and grand,
Wake in thy loftiness,
Sweep thro' the land!
Light in each breast anew
Patriot fires!
Pledge the old flag again,
Flag of our sires!
Fling all thy folds abroad,
Banner of light!

CHORUS, for Verses 1, 2, 3
Onward! still onward!
Flag of our might!
Onward! victorious!
God for the right!
Amen! Amen!

2.
Spirit of Unity,
Potent, divine,
Come in thy kindliness,
All hearts entwine!
Prove to our enenmies
Ever a rock,
And to each traitor whose
Ruminus[?] shock!
Fling our the flag again,
Starry and bright!

3.
Shades of our Forefathers,
Pass thro' the land,
Cloth'd in full majesty,
Terrible, grand!
Fright from their lurking place
Treason and wrong,
Wake the old loyalty,
Earnest and strong!
Eagle of Liberty,
Soar in the light!

4.
Come kindly trinity,
Noblest and best;
"Faith, Hope and Charity,"
Rule in each breast!
Faith, in our Fatherland,
Hope, in our Lord,
Charity still to all
Blindly who've err'd!
Us and our Liberties
God will defend!

CHORUS for Verse 4
Glory we give Thee,
Father and Friend,
Kingdom and Power,
World without end!
Amen! Amen!
