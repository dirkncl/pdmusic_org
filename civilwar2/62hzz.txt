1. Our native land shall be our song!
  Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
Shout the chorus loud and long!
  Hip, zou, zou! zou, zou! 

CHORUS 1-5.
Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
Hip, hip, hip, zou, zou!
Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
Hip, hip, zou, zou!

2. Then we’ll defend our Starry Flag!
  Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
And trample down the secesh rag!
  Hip, zou, zou! zou, zou!

3. Then, “On to Richmond,” is the cry!
  Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
Old “Jeff” soon will have to fly!
  Hip, zou, zou! zou, zou!

4. Then brave McLellan soon will be!
  Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou!
In the heart of Dixie!
  Hio, zou, zou! zou, zou!

5. Then for the Stars and Stripes huzza!
  Hip, zou, zou! hip, zou, zou"!
Long may they wave, in peace of war!
  Hip, zou, zou! zou, zou!
