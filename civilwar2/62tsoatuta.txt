1. Ages flow’n since Columbus prevailed
Under skies, on deep to his aim;
As over the ocean he then sailed,
To find a world to grace his name,
Where the eagle now a nation’s guide,
Her banners to heaven unfold,
On States combined in Union’s pride.
Through vir rue’s wisdom to behold.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
With thee Columbia ever
True friends in union we’ll remain
Not a link of it to sever;
Thy continent a world retain
From North to South, lie East to West,
Till days and nights united rest,
  Till days and nights u nited rest.

2. Keenly speed on thy stupendous sphere
To greater glories purely rise
As queen of the west, forever here
In honor, and liberty— wise,
With emblems of our Freedom’s treasure;
Truly thy grace we shall adore
While sun and stars thy surface measure,
Thy Peoples one from shore to shore.

3. To hail our fairland, west, far away,
From monarchs’ obedient, clime;
The birds too in harmony do play;
The echoes of devotion’s shrine,
Where Washington, true to mercy’s call,
Did vindicate her rights complete;
See! her schools, and courts, are free to all,
Oh would, we could our saints yet meet.
