1. Father! in the battle fray,
Shelter his dear friend, I pray!
Nerve his young arm with the might
Of Justice, Liberty and Right.
Where the red hail deadliest falls,
Where stern duty loudly calls,
Where the strife is fierce and wild—
Father! guard, oh! guard my child.
Father! guard, oh! guard my child.

2. Where the foe rush swift and strong,
Madly striking for the wrong;
Where the clash of angry steel
Rings above the battlefield;
Where the stifling air is hot
With bursting shell and whistling shot,
Father! to my boy’s brave breast
Let no treach’rous blade be press’d!
Let no treach’rous blade be press’d!

3. Father! if my woman’s heart—
Frail and weak in ev’ry part—
Wanders from Thy Mercy Seat
After those dear roving feet;
Let Thy tender, pitying grace
Ev’ry selfish thought erase!
If this motherlove be wrong–
Pardon, bless and make me strong!
Pardon, bless and make me strong!

4. For when silent shades of night
Shut the bright world from my sight;
When around the cheerful fire
Gather Brothers, Sister, Sire,
Then I miss my boy’s bright face
From the old familiar place,
And my sad heart wanders back
To tented field and bivouac!
To tented field and bivouac!

5. Often in my troubled sleep
Waking,– wearily to weep—
Often dreaming he is near,
Calming every anxious fear,—
Often startled by the flash
Of hostile swords that meet and clash,
Till the cannon’s smoke and roar
Hide him from my eyes once more!
Hide him from my eyes once more!

6. Thus I dream– and hope– and pray,
All the weary hours away;
But I know his cause is just,
And I centre all my trust
In Thy promise,— “As thy day
So shall thy strength be,”— alway!
Yet I need Thy guidance still!
Father! let me do Thy will!
Father! let me do Thy will!

7. If new sorrow should befall,
If my noble boy should fall,
If the bright head I have blessed
On the cold earth find its rest—
Still, will all the motherheart,
Torn, and quivering with the smart,
I yield him, ’neath Thychastening rod,
To his country, and to his God!
To his country, and to his God!
