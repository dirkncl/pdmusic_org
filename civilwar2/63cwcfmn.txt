1. Death has crept upon your pathway,
Hope of life has almost gone,
Yet my comrade in your anguish,
There’s a Friend excell’d by none.
He that is the God of battle,
Looks upon your anxious brow,
He will comfort her in sorrow,
He will care for mother now.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Soon with angels you’ll be marching,
With a crown upon your brow,
Free from care and toil and danger,
Christ will care for mother now.

2. Do not grieve for her my brother,
Tho’ the ties that bind are sweet,
Look to Jesus He has promised,
That in Heav’n we all must meet.
For your Country’s weal you’ve battled,
To your friends you e’er were dear,
War’s fierce din has rug’d around you
Ne’er grin death to make you fear.

3. Let this cheer you while you’re dying,
That you’ve done your duty here,
Christ has promised to reward you,
And you’ll meet your mother there.
Good bye! Comrade, God be with you,
We must leave you: so farewell,
And in Heaven we’ll hope a meeting,
Ne’er to hear a parting knell.

4. Ah! his pulse has ceased its beating,
Soon the spark of life has fred,
Nineteen years of earthly trials,
Now one of the soldier dead.
Rest from cares of home or battle,
Mother, Sister, Country, Friend,
Till our last our heavenly greeting,
Where before God’s Throne we’ll bend.
