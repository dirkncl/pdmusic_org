Respectfully dedicated to his Excellency

"Always Stand on the Union Side" (1863)
A Patriotic Song
Music Composed by M. C. Bisbee.

1.
Always stand on the Union side,
And battle for the right
With conscience clear, we'll laugh at fear;
In the midst of the boldest fight!
Why turn against our native land,
The mother whom we love!
Who ever rules with gentle hand,
Till children recreant prove!

CHORUS
Always stand on the Union side,
And battle for the right
With conscience clear, we'll laugh at fear;
In the midst of the boldest fight!

2.
Always stand in the Union side!
And "keep your powder dry"--
We'll soon rejoice both far and wide,
To see secession die!
Tis better in defence of truth,
To be both brave and bold;
Than side with traitors and at last,
Be "left out in the cold!"

(CHORUS)

3.
Always stand in the Union side!
'Tis better as you see;
For Heav'n will crown our gallant arms,
With Union victory!
If you would have your children learn
To speak with holy pride,
Of this their dear be-lov-ed land!
Stand on the Union side!

(CHORUS)
