1. Strike patriots! strike for the truth and your country! 
For  man’s equal rights, the hard fighting endure, 
Boldly strike for the flag, that extends hope before you; 
Arouse! freemen, fight ’till its stars are secure.

CHORUS 1
Strike down the foes of our freedom; 
Stand by the flag of her pride. 
Death to the traitors that lead them, 
Bond of our strength to divide.

2. Let your hearts be as firm, as the arms which you shoulder 
As the steel at your side, to divide right from wrong; 
Keep your eye on the Union, and God shall uphold her! 
Fix bayonet, charge, like the whirlwind along!

CHORUS 2
Strike down the foes of our freedom; 
Stand by the flag of her pride. 
Death to the traitors that lead them, 
Land of our hearts to divide.

3. Let no demoqogue tyrants lay hand on your freedom; 
Answer back the base hords, with the guns’ angry boom— 
Strike, strike, ’tis the time for true men! May God speed them, 
To fill up the ranks, and give tyrants their doom.

CHORUS 3
Strike down the foes of our freedom; 
Stand by the flag of her pride. 
Death to the traitors who lead them, 
Home of the free to divide.

4. We! we are His people, and God is our leader, 
No tyrant No despot! No king save our God— 
We are free! we are free! Freedom! God hath decreed her, 
To tread tyrants down on America’s sod.

CHORUS 4
Strike down the foes of our freedom; 
Stand by the flag of her pride. 
Death to the traitors who lead them, 
We that are one to divide.
