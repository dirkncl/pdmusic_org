1.
By my window saddly sitting,
In the steady glowing gloom
Where the twilight shadows flitting,
Like hushed hands into my room,
Find me sighing, watching, weeping,
O'er the death of ev'ry joy
As I wait in vain thy greeting,
Blue eyed Soldier Boy,
  As I wait in vain thy greeting,
  Blue eyed Soldier Boy.

2.
Ev'ry token dearer growing
Which thy loved hand gave to me,
And my widowed heart still knowing,
Just how dear thou art to me.
All my mirth is but a seeming.
Ev'ry pleasure hath alloy.
For the thee I'm never dreaming,
Blue eyed Soldier Boy,
  For the thee I'm never dreaming,
  Blue eyed Soldier Boy.

3.
God of Battles! oh... hear me,
In the anguish of my heart!
He is very, very near me,
Do not will that we must part.
I'm a maiden lone and lonely,
And my life has little joy.
Save the one, my "dear one" only,
Blue eyed Soldier Boy,
  Save the one, my "dear one" only,
  Blue eyed Soldier Boy.
