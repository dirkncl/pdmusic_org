"Angel Mother[,]
I’m coming Home" [5 Aug 1863; 13 Feb 1864]
The last words of
A dying soldier at the battle of Gettysburg.
Words by
W. Dexter Smith Jr.

Extract from a letter from a Massachusetts soldier.

"A sweet smile o'erspread his features, his lips moved, and he 
whispered George I am dying, tell the boys we shall meet again 
where parting does not come. Again he spoke of his happy
childhood, his brothers, sisters, and his mother who had died 
since his enlistment. His last words were 'Angel mother I'm 
coming home!' after which he sank back to rise no more."

Music by
M. J. Lessur.

1. Angel mother, I am dreaming
  Of our little, cottage home,
When earth seemed a blooming garden
  Ere my feet had learned to roam:
Where my brothers played beside me
  Till the long, long day was done
And we knew no care or sorrow,
  Life and happiness were one.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
[This song is complete without the chorus.]
Angel mother, Angel mother
Now I see thy smile so bright
And with angels for my guidance
I am coming home tonight.

2. But with years came many changes—
  Brothers, sisters, having died
Sleep together in the valley—
  And one rests beneath the tide.
And thou too hast left our circle
  Since I came from home to die
Neath the banner of my country,
  Where her bravest heroes lie.

3. Angel mother I remember
  When we parted, long ago
When our last farewell was whispered
  And thy voice so sweet and low
Seemed like that of seraph singing
  In the realm so fair and bright
And its music soft yet thrilling
  Lingers in my heart tonight.

4. I remember, that fair morning
  Kneeling ’neath the elm wood tree
When I promised (Heaven willing)
  That I would return to thee.
I have fallen in the conflict
  Battling for the truth and right
Yet we’ll meet again in heaven—
  I am coming home tonight.

5. All the past is now before me
  Joys and sorrows, pleasure, pain,
Floating in a vision o’er me
  All life’s hours come back again:
Dearest faces so long hidden
  From my yearning mortal sight
Press around me all unbidden—
  I shall meet them all tonight.

6. Yes earth’s clouds are now dispelling
  Heavenly glories meet my view
Beautiful, angelic visions
  Glimpses Mother dear of you:
Sweetest voices call me homeward
  Brightest pinions guide my flight
Angel mother I am coming—
  Coming home to thee tonight.
