1. Hurrah for the glorious West!
She has turned out the bravest and best,
  And victory follows her arms;
How they poured forth their volleys of fire
While the bright starry banners rose higher
  In the midst of the battle’s alarm! 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah,
hurrah. hurrah, hurrah, hur-
rah, for the glorious West!
She has turned out the bravest and best,
And victory
And victory follows her arms.

2. Fort Donaldson’s ramparts are down,
And so are her men of renown,
  Those leaders of fury and fright;
They are carried off captives or slain,
And fugitives over the plain,
  Escape from the terrible fight.

3. Hurrah for the bold General Grant!
He knew no such phrase as “I can’t”
  But uttered in thunder “I will—”
“Move onward! Move onward!”— the land
Echoed wide to the word of command,
  And hark! it reverberates still.

4. Oh, perish, ye traitors and knaves,
Ye changers of men into slaves,
  Ye rebels, so craven and base—
Where now is your boasted reliance,
And where are your looks of defiance,
  ’Mid clouds of defeat and disgrace?

5. The dastards and wretches who fled,
By the thief of Virginia led,
  May tell of the capture and shame
Of their brothersinarms who contended
Till the hot bloody contest was ended,
  And the West won her laurels of fame.

6. The West— the victorious West.
With praises and thanks she is blest;
  She has crushed with invincible might
This war of Rebellion to dust,
And she will do more if she must,
  And her’s the glory by right.
