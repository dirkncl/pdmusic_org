1.
Keep step with the music of the Union,
 The music our ancestors sung,
When the States like a jubilant Chorus,
 To beautiful sisterhood sprung!
Oh! thus shall their great Constitution,
 That guards all the homes, all the homes of the land,
A mountain of freedom and justice,
 For millions eternally stand,
While we step to the music of Union
 _One_ Banner alone o'er the sod,
_One_ voice from America swelling
 In worship of Liberty's God,

CHORUS
North and South, East and West all unfurling
One Banner alone o'er the sod--
One voice from America swelling,
In worship of Liberty's God.

2.
Keep step with the music of Union,
 What grandeur its flag has unrolled--
For the loyal, a heaven-wove rainbow,
 For traitors, a storm in each fold!
The glorious shade of Mount Vernon
 Still points to each patriot-grave,
Still cries-- oe'r the long mighty ages
That Eagle of Lexington wave!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
While we step to the music of Union
_One_ Banner alone o'er the sod
_One_ voice from America swelling
In worship of Liberty's God!

3.
Keep step wi the music of Union!
 The forests have sunk at its sound,
The pioneer's brows beam with triumph,
 And Labor's broad opulance crowned;
Oh! yet _must_ all giant rude forces
 Of Nature be chained to our ears,
All mountains, lakes, rivers and oceans
 Crouch under the Stripes and the Stars.

4.
Keep step with the music of Union,
 Thus still shall we nourish the light
Our fathers lit for the chained nations
 That darkle in Tyranny's night!
The blood of the whole world is with us,
 O'er Ocean by Tyranny burled,
And they who would dare to insult us
 Shall sink with the wrath of the world.

5.
Keep step with the music of Union,
 The music of Liberty, Right;
Singing nations by _brotherhood_ only
 Are bannered with honor and might,
Then hurrah for the Past with its glory!
 For the strong, earnest Present, hurrah!
And a cheer for the starry browed Future
 With Freedom, and Virtue, and Law.
