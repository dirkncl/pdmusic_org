1.
Where the green willows wav'd by the brook,
And the sweet waters danced and smiled,
In a cottage nestled in a quiet nook,
Dwelt the basket maker's child.

'Twas the sabbath eve,
The stars twinkled bright in the sky,
The hills reechoed the night bird's song,
When they told me she must die.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The green willows waved by the brook,
The stars glitter'd bright in the sky,
The wind's low moan the leaves shook,
On that stilly night by that murm'ring brook,
When they told me she might die.

2.
Oh weep not for me she said,
Tho' the death damp has dimmm'd my eye,
My Saviour's hand is beneath my head,
I do not fear to die.

I go to my happy home.
My eath work is almost done,
And I hear my blessed Saviour's words,
"Let little children come!"

3.
Let me rest beside the brook,
Where the sweet waters flow so mild.
And I carve on the tree where I used to play,
"I'm the basket maker's child."

Where the green willows wave by the brook,
And the sweet waters danced and smiled.
We have laid her to rest and carved on the oak,
"The basket maker's child."
