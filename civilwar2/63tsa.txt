1. Of course you’ve heard about the fight
We’ve had at Charleston lately,
And how the rebels seem’d to be
All terrified so greatly.
But do you know what ’twas about,
This secesh consternation!
A dread “Swamp Angel” hovered o’er
The “hotbed” of the nation!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Gilmore says to Beauregard,
My Angel soon shall send her
Great thund’ring shells thro’ all the town!
Unless you will surrender.

2. Old Beaure, he was very mad,
And vowed he would not do it!
“I’ll stay in town, sir, if I please,
So send your “Angel” thro’ it!”
Then Gilmore sent the Angel down,
The Big Gun with its thunder,
And this was what made such a fuss,
And caused the rebs to wonder.

3. A “big thing” is this “Angel,” sir,
For “popping and for shelling.”
Of all the guns it is the king,
Five miles the power is telling.
Down in a swamp it closely lies
And watches over traitors,
It has a striking love for all
Those Southern “Yankee haters!”
