1. Ye would sever the Union! but can ye undo
The relation  of brother to brother?
Ye may coldly regard him and slander too,
But when sorrow o’ertakes him, your heart will be true
To the love ye once bore him, when together ye grew
In peace by the side of your mother.

2. Ye would sever the Union! but will ye divide
The Flag of our Freedom and Glory?
It wav’d o’er the field where our forefathers died!
Their children unfurl it with reverend pride
And whose shall the task be to throw it aside,
And tell the sad nations the story!

3. If ye sever the Union! then Liberty dies!
To restore her, in vain the endeavor!
She will soar to you distant and cloudmantel’d skies,
And in vain will the world lift its questioning eyes,
She will not be mov’d by its grief or surprise—
Once mute, she is silent forever!
