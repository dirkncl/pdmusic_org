1. He has fallen! the noble, the young and the brave,
The tidings speed onward o’er mountain and wave;
And woman’s tears falling, and manly eyes wet,
Speak truly and deeply our Nation’s regret.

CHORUS 1-5.
While your thousand brave lips shout the watchword on high,
“Remember brave Ellsworth!” then conquer, or die.

2. In the pride of his youth and the dawn of his fame,
He fell! and green laurels encircle his name;
That name shall go down with its halo of glory,
And posterity weep as it lists to the story.

3. That name will be link’d with the brave martyr’d “three,”
And fresh in our hearts shall his memory be;
From where cord Maine’s rocks the Atlantic waves roar,
To dark Missisippi’s spray dashing on shore.

4. Oh! muffle the drums as the bier passes by—
The flag of our country half masted on high;
For that flag he has fought, for that flag he has died;
Aye! lay it with reverence low at his side.

5. Remember your hero! oh! brave, gallant band—
Remember his death— by the murderer’s hand;
And when rebel banners shall float on free air;
Be first in the field!— as he would have been there.
