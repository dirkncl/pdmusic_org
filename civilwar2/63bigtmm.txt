1. See! ere the sun sinks behind those hills,
Ere darkness the earth doth cover,
You will lay me low, in the cold, damp ground,
Break it gently to my mother!
I see her sweet sad face on me now,
and a smile doth o’er it hover;
O God! I would spare the tears that will flow,
Break it gently to my mother.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Good bye, my mother ever dear;
Sister, you loved your brother;
Comrades, I take a last farewell,
Break it gently to my mother.

2. Oh, say that in battle I’ve nobly died,
For Right and our Country’s honor;
Thickly around fell our enemy’s shafts,
Yet God saved our starry banner!
My sister, playmate of boyhood’s years,
will lament her fallen brother;
She must try to sooth our parent’s woe,
Break it gently to my mother.
