1. He has gone, and I have sent him,
Think you I would bid him stay
Leaving, cravenlike, to others,
All the burden of the day!
All the burden? Nay the triumph!
Is it hard to understand,
All the joy that thrills the hero,
Battling for his narive land.

2. He has gone and I have sent him!
Could I keep him at my side
While the brave old ship that bears us,
Plunger in the per’lous tide,
Nay I blush but at the question,
What am I that I should chill,
All his brave and gen’rous promptings,
Captive to a woman’s will.

3. He has gone, and I have sent him,
I have buckled on his sword.
I have bidd’n him strike for freedom,
For his country for the Lord!
As I marked his lofty bearing,
And the flush upon his cheek,
I have caught my heart rebelling,
That my woman’s arm is weak.

4. He has gone and I have sent him!
Not without a thought of pain
For I know the war’s dread chances,
And we may not meet again,
Life itself is but a lending,
He that gave, perchance may take,
If it be so, I will bear it,
Meekly for my country’s sake.
