1.
'Twas dawn in the meadows, the violets were blowing,
And the springtime grass was fresh and green;
And the birds by the brooklet their sweet songs were singing
When I met my darling Daisy Deane.

CHORUS
None knew thee but to love thee, thou dear one of my heart,
O thy mem'ry is ever fresh and green,
Tho' the sweet buds may wither and fond hearts be broken,
Still I'll love thee my darling Daisy Deane.

2.
Her eyes soft and tender, the violets outsising,
And a fairer form was never seen---
With her brown woven tresses, her cheek like the roses,
There was none like my darling Daisy Deane.

(CHORUS)

3.
The bright flowers are faded, the young grass has fallen,
And a dark cloud hovers o'er the scene;
For the death angel took her, and left me in sorrow
For my lost one, my darling Daisy Deane.

(CHORUS)

4.
O, dawn in the meadows I still love to wander,
Where the young grass grew fresh and green;
But the bright golden visions of springtime have faded
With the flowers, and my darling Daisy Deane.

(CHORUS)
