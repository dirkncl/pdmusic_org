1. We are a host of soldiers bold, with hearts both light and gay, 
We cheer’ly join the jovial song and pass the time away; 
We care not for the rebel host where e’er they show their hand, 
We’ve fighting for our Country’s rights ’gainst traitors in our land; 
And with Rosecrans to lead us on we’ll chase the reber for— 
We’ll storm their forts and ri fle pits where ever ewe may go.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! 
The Heav’s shall ring while loud weeping of Rosecrans the Brave.

2. Our Gen’ral is a fighting man and plays no double game— 
He’s fighting for the Union and not for paltry grain; 
We love our gallant General and long may be command— 
He is a host within himselft, the darling Rosecrans! 
And with Rosecrans to lead us on, Jeff Davis will find out, 
We’ve got a Gen’ran in the field that knows what he’s about.

3. We’re not the metal to be scar’d by traitors you will see, 
For ev’ry rebel indue time shall humbly bow the knee. 
To the Stars and Stripes that o’er us float so beautiful and grand, 
For treason soon will be crush’d out and peace reign o’er the land. 
And with Rosecrans to lead us on, no matter where’t may be, 
All hearts will leap with a joyful shout marching to victory.

4. Then soldiers all take off your hats and shout aloud with me—
We’ll soak the earth with rebel blood but what we willl be free,
Cheer up my boys and never fear, but give the rebs a groan,
Our job will soon be done out here and then for rebs at home.
With Rosecrans to lead us on you’ll find ’twill just be so—
They’ll get ten feet of a hempen cord to burry them down below.
