1. Of all the lands in this round world 
I love my own the best. 
Its mountains and its mighty streams, 
The em pire of the West. 
Here freedom’s song is ever heard, 
Here monarch’s have no pow’r, 
Each man is master of the soil, 
With freedom for his dow’r. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then hail! Columbia hail! 
The land of liberty. 
The refuge of the pilgrim 
and home of the free!

2. They tell of royal robes and thrones, 
And palaces and tow’rs, 
But have not learn’d to sing a song, 
As glad and free as ours, 
Our Eagle fans the mountain peaks, 
Our vessels sweep the seas, 
And where so’ e’er our banner floats, 
Our name is great and free.
