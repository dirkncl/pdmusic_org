1.
Shall we yield to the foe, who have broken their trust,
Who the flag of our country have trail'd in the dust,
Who haved soil'd those broad stripes, once so fair to our view,
And have torn the bright stars from their heaven of blue,
Who haved soil'd those broad stripes, once so fair to our view.

CHORUS
No, no, freemen no, up, arm for the fight,
Our flag shall still wave in its glory and might
And the traitors shall know on the land and the sea
That the stars and the stripes is the flag of the free
And the traitors shall know on the land and the sea
That the stars and the stripes is the flag of the free.

Three cheers for the red, white, and blue,
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue,
Thy banners make tyranny tremble,
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue.

2.
Shall we yield to the foe, shall we let our fair land,
Of its freedom be shorn by their traitorous hands,
Shall the union our fathers once fought to maintain,
By the rebels he plunder'd, and riven in twain,
Shall the union our fathers once fought to maintain.

(CHORUS)

3.
Then together ye brave, from the north and the west;
Let us strike for the land and the home we love best;
Raise the stars and the stripes, in their glory and might,
For the warcry has sounded up arm for the fight
Raise the stars and the stripes, in their glory and might.

CHORUS
Then up, freemen up, arm, &c.
