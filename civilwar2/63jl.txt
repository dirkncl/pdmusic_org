1. The tear was in the soldier’s eye, 
As on a summer’s morn 
He bid a last and fond goodbye, 
To weeping Jeannie Lorn. 
They stray’d down to the meadow where, 
’Mid the rustling of the corn, 
He first had whisper’d words of love 
To pretty Jennie Lorn.

CHORUS [sung afte each verse]
Goodbye, Jennie, dear, 
Do not weep for me, 
For when the war is over 
Then I’ll come back to thee!

2. The summer’s sun has sunk to rest, 
The corn is gather’d now; 
The red, red rose has wither’d, 
The leaves fall off the bough! 
And keen and cold the wint’ry blast 
Across the moor is borne, 
And who does not the soldier write 
To weeping Jennie Lorn?

3. At length, one day, a weary step
Approach’d the cottage door,—
A wounded comrade brought the news
Her Edward was no more;
She spoke no words, she made no sigh,
But the robin on the thorn,
Ere Spring had come, chirp’d sadly o’er
The grave of Jennie Lorn.
