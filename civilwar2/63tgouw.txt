1. Come all who love the Union, and join our Northern band; 
We’ll squash the Southern Rebels, and drive them from the land. 
Stern Justice is our motto, and providence our guide, 
So jump in to the wagon, and we’ll all take a ride. 

CHORUS 
Hurrah, for the Wagon, the good old Union Wagon; 
Uncle Sam drives the Wagon, so we’ll all take a ride. 

2. The Union is our watchword, our rights we will maintain. 
The Union forever from Florida to Maine. 
Father Abe is in the White house with Halleck by his side. 
Brave Rosecrans and his army, they are the nation’s pride.

3. Our Wagon’s in good order, the running gear is sound, 
’Tis fill’d with bone and music and well guarded oil around. 
Then come ye Union people, we’ll stand up side by side, 
With our starry flag and banner, we’ll all take a ride. 

CHORUS 
Hurrah, for the Wagon, the good old Union Wagon; 
Uncle Sam drives the Wagon, so we’ll all take a ride. 

4. Our cause is just and holy, our men are brave and true; 
And if they catch the traitors, they pepper them a few. 
God bless our noble order; to it we’ll all confide 
So jump ioto the Wagon and we’ll all take a ride.
