containing two lines of Verse]

1. Have you heard the news that I heard today?
  The news that trembles on ev’ry lip?
[missing two lines of Verse]
The sky it asks for three hundred thousand men,
  And I would be one, mother, let me go.

CHORUS 1-5. [sung twice after each Verse]
Let me go, let me go,
Kiss me, mother, and let me go.

2. The love of country was born with me;
  I remember how my young heart would thrill,
[missing two lines of Verse]
When I used to have me shame the brave old blood?
  Nay, kiss me, mother, and let me go,

3. Our flag, the flag of our hope and pride,
  With its stars and stripes and its field of blue,
[missing two lines of Verse]
Is mock’d in downtrodden millions weep and fear,
  So kiss me, mother, and let me go.

4. Under the burning southern skies,
  Our borthers languish in heartsick pain;
They turn to us with their pleasing eyes:
  Oh, mother, say, shall they turn in vain?
Their ranks are thinning from sun to sun,
  Yet bravely they hold at bay the foe;
Shall we let them die then, one by one?
  Nay, kiss me, mother, and let me go.

5. Can you selfishly cling to your household joys,
  Refusing this smalllest tithe to yield,
While thousands of mothers are sending boys,
  Beloved as yours, to the battle field?
Can you see my country call in vain,
  And restrain my arm from the needful blow?
Not so; tho’ your heart should break with pain,
  You will kiss me, bless me, and bid me go.
