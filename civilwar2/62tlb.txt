1. Shall we give them a broadside my boys as she goes?”
“Shall we send yet another to tell
In irontongued words, to Columbia’s foes
How bravely her sons say “farewell?”
Ah! what tho’ we sink ’neath the turbulent wave,
’Tis with “Duty and Right” at the helm.
And over the form should the fierce waters rave,
No tide can the spirit o’erwhelm!
No tide can the spirit o’erwhelm!

2. “Shall we give them a broadside once more my brave men?
Ay! ay!” rose the full earnest cry!
“A broadside, a broadside we’ll give them again,
Then, for God and the right nobly die!”
“Haste! haste!” for amid all that battering din
Comes a gurgling sound fraught with fear,
As swift flowing waters pour rushingly in,
Up! up! ’till the portholes they near!
Up! up! ’till the portholes they near!

3. No blenching— no falt’ring! still fearless all seem,
Each man firm to duty doth bide,
A flash! and a broadside! a shout! a careen!
And the “Cumberland” sinks ’neath the tide;
The “Star Spangled Banner” still floating above,
As a heaven upon the dark wave!
Our ensign of glory, proud streaming in love
O’er the tomb of the Loyal and Brave!
O’er the tomb of the Loyal and Brave!

4. Bold hearts! mighty spirits! “tried gold” of our land!
A halo of glory your meed;
All honor’d the noblesoul’d Cumberland band:
So true in Columbia’s need.
  Bold hearts! mighty spirits! “tried gold” of our land!
  A halo of glory your meed;
  All honor’d the noblesoul’d Cumberland band:
  So true in Columbia’s need.
