  At the closing anniversary of the United States Christian Com-
mission held at Washington on the 11th February, 1866, the Hon.
Schulyler Colfaz, said: "At the last anniversary of the Commission,
on the last Sabbath of January, 1865, that striking Ode, 'Your Mission,'
was sung.  Abraham Lincoln, with his tall form, his care-furrowed face,
and his nobly-throbbing heart, was here, and listened to it; the tears
coursing down his cheeks."  Subsequently he sent up the programme,
which Mr. Colfax exhibited; on which appears the following request, in
his familiar hand-writing,---written by that hand now lying cold in the
grave:---
  "Near the close, let us have 'Your Mission' repeated by Mr. Phillips.
Don't say I called for it."---_Lincoln_.
  Mr. Phillips, of Cincinnati, then sung, amidst profound silence,
this beautiful Ode.

[Words by Ellen Maria "Jesse" R. (nee Huntington)] Gates, 18??-1920]

1.
If you cannot on the ocean
Sail among the swiftest fleet,
Rocking on the highest billows,
Laughing at the storms you meet,
You can stand among the sailors,
Anchor'd yet within the bay,
You can lend a hand to help them,
As they launch their boats away,
  As they launch their boats away.

2.
If you are too weak to journey
Up the mountain steep and high,
You can stand within the valley,
While the multitudes go by,
You can chant in happy measure,
As they slowly pass along
Though they may forget the singer,
They will not forget the song,
  They will not forget the song.

3.
If you have not gold and silver
Ever ready to command,
If you cannot towards the needy,
Reach an ever open hand,
You can visit the afflicted,
O're the erring you can weep,
You can be a true disciple,
Sitting at the Saviour's feet,
  Sitting at the Saviour's feet.

4.
If you cannot in the conflict,
Prove yourself a soldier true,
If where fire and smoke are thickest,
There's no work for you to do;
When the battle-field is silent,
You can go with careful tread,
You can bear away the wounded,
You can cover up the dead,
  You can cover up the dead.

5.
Do not then stand idly waiting
For some greater work to do,
Fortune is a lazy goddess,
She will never come to you,
Go and toil in any vineyard,
Do not fear to do or dare,
If you want a field of labor,
You can find it anywhere,
  You can find it anywhere.
