1. Dear me gently to yon hill side,
  Where the sunlight lingers yet,
Let me gaxe upon its glories,
  Ere the sun of life has set,
Let me bring in all those beauties
  That surround me— Earth and sky!
And let me kiss the dear old Flag
  Once more before I die,
    And let me kiss the dear old Flag
    Once more before I die.

2. I feel the sunshine on my face,
  The cool breeze stirs my hair,
But all around grows dim— and hark!
  What music fill the air?
It is the loved ones calling me,
  While helpless here I lie—
Ah! let me kiss the dear old Flag
  Once more before I die!
    Ah! let me kiss the dear old Flag
    Once more before I die!

3. My heart is with my country’s cause,
  I freely give my life,
But O! my love clings fondly to
  My children and my wife.
Tell them I loved them ever—
  That their names— my latest sigh—
Quick— let me kiss the dear old Flag
  Once more before I die!
    Quick— let me kiss the dear old Flag
    Once more before I die!
