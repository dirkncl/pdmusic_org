CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hail! Freedom-land,
Hail! Freemen-band,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;

1. Nations! rejoice,
With glorious voice!
Our cannons’ roar,
“Slaves are no more.”
Hail! Freedomland,
Hail! Freedomband,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;

2. Our flag unfurl’d,
O’er the new world,
Waves without pall
For human thrall;
Hail! Freedomland,
Hail! Freedomband,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;

3. Glad Echo thrills,
Through native hills,
Where, our lov’d sires
Lit, Freedom’s fires;
Hail! Freedomland,
Hail! Freedomband,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;

4. Trusting in God,
On blood stain’d sod,
The Freeman’s son,
Freedom’s fight, won.
Hail! Freedomland,
Hail! Freedomband,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;

5. Great God! in Thee!
God of the free!
Trust we— Freemen;
Ever— Amen.
Hail! Freedomland,
Hail! Freedomband,
Sing! Jubilee!
Shout Victory;
