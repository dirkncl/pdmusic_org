1. Farewell gentle Brother, how sweet be thy rest
In the home of the good, and the land of the blest,
Thou hast crossed the dark river and reached the green shore
Where the battle’s wild tumult will greet thee no more.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dearest Brother, gentle Brother, faretheewell;
On that evergreen shore, where the weary rest,
In their beautiful homes among the blest,
We shall meet thee, dear Brother, soon meet thee again.

2. O! hard was the parting, with young life so bright,—
In the beauty of youth, thou hast gone from our sight;
Yet we would not have thee recross the dark tide
To travel life’s journey again by our side.

3.Now silent the bower where in childhood we played,
And lonely the walks where our footsteps have strayed;
The books thou did’st love unopened now lie,
And the flow’rs thou hast cherished, must wither and die.

4. The birds now may sing in thy favorite tree,
The sun in his beauty shine down on the lea,
And the old blessed homestead remain on the lawn,
But the light of thy presence forever has gone.

5. O’er the turf of thy grave— tho’ the stranger may tread,
And war’s desolation around it be spread,
Thy spirit now rests where the cannon’s loud roar,
And the battle’s wild shriek shall disturb thee no more.
