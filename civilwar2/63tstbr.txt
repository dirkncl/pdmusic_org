1. ’Tis sweet to be remembered in the turmoils of this life, 
While toiling up its pathway while mingling in its strife, 
While wandering o’er earth’s borders or sailing on the sea, 
’Tis sweet to be remembered where ever we may be, 
Oh! ’Tis sweet to be remembered whereever we may be.

2. When those we love are absent from our hearthstone and our side, 
’Tis joy to know that pleasure that peace with them abide 
And that although we’re absent we’re thought of day by day, 
’Tis sweet to be remembered by those who are far away, 
Oh! ’Tis sweet to be remembered by those who are far away.

3. When all our toils are ended— the conflict all is done, 
And peace in sweetest accents proclaim the vict’ry won, 
When hushed are all our sorrows and calm is all the strife, 
’Tis sweet to be remembered in the closing hour of life, 
Oh! ’Tis sweet to be remembered in the closing hour of life.
