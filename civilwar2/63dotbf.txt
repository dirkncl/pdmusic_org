1. Mother, mother,— not another
Can thy holy place supply,
I am pining for the twining
Of thy arms once ere I die.
In the rattle of the battle,
Fought I well the trait’rous foe;
O my gleaming blade was streaming,
Loyalty sent home each blow.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Mother, mother,— not a mother
Can thy holy place supply;
I am pining for the twining
Of thy arms once ere I die.

2. Come then mother! there’s no other
Touch like thine for my poor brow.
Lowly sighing, I am dying.
Lay thy dear hand on me now.
Mem’ry bringing soft thy singing,
As on childhood’s ear it fell;
Love most gracious now so precious—
Hark! “He doeth all them well.”

3. Mother, mother! haste sweet mother!
Bend beside my cot the knee:
Lift entreaty, Heaven will pity.
Help me in this agony.
Bless me, mother, Angel mother!
Grieve not o’er thy soldier song.
God, let never the Union sever.
Earth’s unrival’d glorious one!
