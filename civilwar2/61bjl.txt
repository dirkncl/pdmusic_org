1.
How sweet the hour, when with my love,
'Mid Lothian's hills I stray,
Where whippoorwill, with shrilly notes,
Proclaims the close of day;
Where heather blooms so bright and fair,
Beside the winding Dee,
'Twas there I met, one summer's morn,
My bonnie Jennie Lee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The happy days, now past and gone,
I never more shall see;
And never shall we roam again
Upon the banks of Dee.

2.
Upon the river's glassy tide,
When sinks the tide to rest,
Within our bonnie host we glide,
How happy and law best.
O! Scotia's bonnie lakes are bright,
Her hills are fair to see.
Yet hills nor lakes cannot compare
With bonnie Jennie Lee.

3.
But alas! we meet, meet no more,
Upon the banks of Dee,
I've plucked the heather from the shore,
And strewed them round her grave;
How sadly pass my toilsome hours,
Life has no charms for me,
Since from my arms death hath removed,
My bonnie Jennie Lee.
