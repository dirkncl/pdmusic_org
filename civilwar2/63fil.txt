1. Volunteers, gird on your armor.
  See! the foe’s in sight:
Hark! the trumpetcall is sounding
  Ready for the fight.
Grasp your swords my gallant comrades,—
  Heed the Captain’s sign;
At the signaL let us all be 
  Falling into line.

2. What tho’ Rebels now confront us
  With their grim array;
“Fighting Joe” is now our leader
  We will win the day.
Spready move along the columns
  Vallant brave and true;
They will ne’er their flag dishonor,—
  The Red, the White, the Blue.

3. We will ever love our Country
  Best beneath the sun;
And we’ll love our States forever
  Thirtyfour in one.
’Tis a Union now, and ever
  Shall we keep it so;
Never will we yield its banner
  To a trait’rous foe.

4. Come then, rally for the Union,
  Hear your Country’s call;
Would you have your Nation sever‘d,—
  Your Starry Banner fall?
Firmly let our ranks move onward,—
  Raise the battlecry;
“Liberty and Union” ever,
  Freedom now is nigh!
