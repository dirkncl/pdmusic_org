1. A Soldier I’m just from the war,
  Foot halls, foot halls,
A Soldier I’m just from the war,
  Foot halls says I.
A Soldier I’m just from the war
Where thund’ring guns and cannons roar,
  And we’ll all drink stone blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
And we’ll all drink stone blind,
Johnny fill up the bowl. 

2. I’ve been in many a bully fight,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
I’ve been in many a bully fight,
  Foot halls, says I.
I’ve been in many a bully fight,
And I’ll tell you about a few tonight;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

3. At first they led us to Bull run,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
At first they led us to Bull run,
  Foot halls says I.
At first they led us to Bull run,
But changed one base for Washington;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

4. The rebels came to Maryland,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
The rebels came to Maryland,
  Foot halls, says I.
The rebels came to Maryland,
A ragged roungh and hungry hand;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

5. They didn’t have much time to stay,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
They didn’t have much time to stay,
  Foot halls, says I;
They didn’t have much time to stay,
For well we fought them night and day;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

6. Old Stonewall Jackson and his crew,
  Foot halls, foor halls;
Old Stonewall Jackson and his crew,
  Foot halls, says I;
Old Stonewall Jackson and his crew,
We made “Nip up de do den do!”
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

7. For bravely did our little Mae,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
For bravely did our little Mae,
  Foot halls, says I;
For bravely did our little Mae,
Make them take the backward track;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

8. There was a man went to the war,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
There was a man went to the war,
  Foot halls, says I;
There was a man went to the war,
The greatest fool you ever saw;
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

9. He had a hat but ne’er a coat,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
He had a hat but ne’er a coat,
  Foor halls, says I;
He had a hat but ne’er a coat,
So he buttoned his pantaloons up to his throat!
  And we’ll all drink snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

10. The ladies fell in love with him,
  Foot halls, foot halls;
The ladies fell in love with him;
  Foor halls, says I;
The ladies fell in love with him,
His maiden name I think was dim;
  And we’ll all dring snow blind,
  Johnny fill up the bowl.

11. To the camp meeting we did go, &c. Repeat.
And floured the niggers white as snow;
  And we’ll all &c.

12. You ought to see them sing and jump, &c. Repeat.
And chase the Old Boy round a stump;
  And we’ll all &c.

13. The woods with shout and chorus rant, &c. Repeat.
And this was one of the songs they sang,—
  “And we‘ll all &c.

14. The Merrimac was all the talk, &c. Repeat.
But the little Monitor made her walk!
  And we’ll all &c.

15. And thoug the Monitor’s days are o’er, &c. Repeat.
Where she came from there’s plenty more!
  And we’ll all &c.

16. John Bull dont like our Iron-clads, &c. Repeat.
Nor Frenchy our Columbiads!
  And we’ll &c.

17. They make them feel so very queer, &c. Repeat.
I hardly think they’ll interfere;
  And we’ll all &c.
