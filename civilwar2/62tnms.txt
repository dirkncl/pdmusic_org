Oft in the stilly night 
E’er slumber’s chain hath bound me 
Fond memory brings the light 
Of the last rose of summer 
Left blooming alone 
All its lovely companions 
Are way down upon the Swanee ribber 
Far, far away, 
Dere’s where my heart is turning ebber, 
Dere’s where 
Young Rory O’More courted Kathleen Bawn, 
He was bold as a lion, she as soft as a fawn, 
He sought in his heart pretty Kathleen to 
Love not love  not ye hapless sons of clay, 
Hopes gayest wreathes are made of earthly flowers 
Friends that we love may fade 
All alone my watch I’m keeping 
In the hazel dell, 
Far my darling Nelly’s near me sleeping Nelly 
Do they miss me at home do they miss me 
’Twould be an assurance most dear 
To know at this moment some loved one 
Was saying I wish he was 
Home sweet home there is no place like 
Hail Columbia happy land 
Hail ye heroes heaven horn band 
Who wont go home ’till morning, 
We wont go home ’till morning, 
We wont go home ’till morning, 
’Till daylight doth appear.
