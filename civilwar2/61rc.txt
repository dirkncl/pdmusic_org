1. Rise ye sons of old Columbia; 
Gather to your Country’s call, 
On your arms no longer slumber, 
Rise to help her one and all! 
Cast away each  feud and faction; 
Brood not over wrong nor ill; 
Rouse your virtues into action, 
For we love our Country still.

CHORUS 1
Hail Columbia, Hail Columbia, 
  Raise that thrilling shout once more, 
  Raise that thrilling shout once more. 
Hail Columbia! Hail Columbia! 
  Conquer over sea and shore, 
  Conquer over sea and shore.

2. See upreared our Holy Standard! 
Crowd around it gallant hearts! 
What? Columbia’s fame be slander’d 
As by fault on our parts? 
Let the cruel tyrants threaten; 
Let the mad invaders come, 
Fly to battle, what if beaten? 
We can die for friends and home! 

CHORUS 2
Hail Columbia, Hail Columbia, 
  Wakes our chorus ever more, 
  Wakes our chorus ever more, 
Hail Columbia, Hail Columbia, 
  Wakes that chorus ever more.
  Wakes that chorus ever more.

3. Rise then patriots name endearing! 
Let the Union ever stand; 
Raise the Stars and Stripes so cheering, 
Glorious banner of our land: 
Rise! ye sons of old Columbia; 
Rise! our common  weal to nerve. 
Rise! while now the song enthralls you 
Thrilling ev’ry vein and nerve.

CHORUS 3
Hail Columbia, Hail Columbia, 
  Conquer as thou didst of yore, 
  Conquer as thou didst of yore, 
Hail Columbia, Hail Columbia, 
  Conquer as thou didst of yore.
  Conquer as thou didst of yore.
