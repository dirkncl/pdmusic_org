1. Floating on the breath of evening,
Breathing in the morning prayer,
Hear I oft the tender voices,
That once made my world so fair,
I forget while list’ning to them,
All the sorrows I have known,
And upon the troubles present,
Faith’s pure shining light is thrown.
And upon the troubles present,
Faith’s pure shining light is thrown.

2. Soothing with their magic whispers,
Calming all my wildest fears,
Thus they bring me sweet submission,
Peace for sorrows, smiles for tears
Bless you, Angel friends oh never,
Leave me lonely on the way,
For your gentle teachings ever,
Meekly may I watch and pray,
For your gentle teachings ever,
Meekly may I watch and pray.
