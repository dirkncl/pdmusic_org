1. The contrabands have got the floor 
Abraham my Abraham. 
They’re butting at the white house door 
Abraham my Abraham. 
They’ve heard the proclamation o’er 
So skedaddled from the southern shore 
As you once did through Baltimore 
Abraham my Abraham.

2. The darkies call thee good and great 
Abraham my Abraham. 
For thou canst run the ship of state 
Abraham my Abraham. 
The south will soon be dessolate 
Of wooly heads at any rate 
For them thou didst emancipate 
Abraham  my Abraham.

3. This year is the jubilee 
Abraham my Abraham. 
The darkies now can all be free 
Abraham my Abraham. 
Jeff Davis says that he shall see 
How many “darks” will to thee flee 
In this great year of sixty three 
Abraham my Abraham.

4. Now that the fatal word is spoke 
Abraham my Abraham. 
The bond which held the “dark” is broke 
Abraham my Abraham. 
Old Jeff he feels thy mighty stroke 
And says the words which thou hast spoke 
Reminds him of a little joke 
Abraham my Abraham.

5. “Once on a time there lived out west, 
Abraham my Abraham, 
A man who doted” on a jest 
Abraham my Abraham. 
The people for this great man sought 
And  his great principle was brought 
To skin a coon before he’s caught 
Abraham my Abraham.
