"Johnny Schmoker" (11 Apr 1863)
A Descriptive Chorus.

- - -
    In this song, an old German musician tells his friend, Johnny Schmoker, about the instruments upon which
he can play, and described them by motions while he sings.  When performed by a chorus, especially of men,
the movements being in exact time, and all together, an effect is produced which has not be equalled by
anything of the kind ever produced in this country.  Observe, that the motions are made only when the words
describing the instruments are sung, as for example, at “Rub a dub a dub,” the roll of the drum, is imitated,
beginning, (as in he case of all the instruments) with the first, and ending exactly with the last word; at “Pilly
willy wink,¨ the hands are placed as if playing the Fife and the fingers only move; at “Tic knock knock,” the
right hand strikes three times under the left as if playing the Triangle; at “Bom bom bom,” the hand is mov-
ed forward and back as if playing the Trombone; and so on the last, which is imitatied by crooking both arms
and striking them against the sides as if playing the Bagpipe.  Observe that the singing at some of the
instruments is loud and at others soft, also that the phrase where each instrument is first mentioned is
repeated, and that the first instrument, which is sung when each instrument is introduced is, to save room
printed but once.  Sing until you come to D. C. then begin again, and omitting that which is marked 1st time.
Go to that which is marked 2nd time, and when you come to the next D. C. go back again to the begin-
ing and omitting both that which is marked 1st time, and that which is marked 2nd time, and go to
that which is marked 3rd time and so on.  The effect of this with a company of children is highly
amusing and entertaining.
