1. Now what the tide of Right can stay?
  The Southern demon cowers;
Our foes fling down their arms today;
  Fort Donelson is ours!
Up with the Federal Flag, my boys!
  Down with the “Stars and Bars!”
Three times three cheers! pale Treason hears,
  And owns the Stripes and Stars.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]

Up with the Federal Flag, my boys!
  Down with the “Stars and Bars”!
Three times three cheers! pale Treason hears—
  And owns the Stripes and Stars.

2. Wild ran the fire along our veins,
  To serve our failing powers:
We strew’d with death the reeking plains;
  But Donelson is ours!
Up with the Federal Flag my boys!
  Down with the Stars and Bars!
Three times three cheers! our Country hears,
  All hail the Stripes and Stars!

3. Down on our right, their cannon balls
  Dropped swift as summer showers:
On rushed our troops— right thro’ their walls!
  Fort Donelson was ours!
Up with the Federal Flag, my boys!
  Down with the “Stars and Bars”!
Three times three cheers!— till Europe hears—
  All hair the Stripes and Stars!

4. Yes, Heaven and we have won the day,
  The Southern demon cowers:
Now what the tide of Right can stay?
  Fort Donelson is ours!
Up with the Federal Flag, my boys!
  Down with the “Stars and Bars”!
Three times three cheers high Heaven hears!
  All hair the Stripes and Stars!
