1. Columbia greets her daughter true, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
To thee a nation’s praise is due, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
For thou hast made the traitor rue 
The hour he places his hopes on you, 
And hurl’d him from thy hills of blue— 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland.

2. Oh, proudly lift thy loyal crest, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland. 
For noble hast thou borne the test, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
The gem, the traitor sought to wrest 
Fair Liberty, God’s own bequest— 
Still brightly decks thy loyal breast, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland.

3. Thy noble head triumphant raise, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
Accept a nation’s grateful praise, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
For thou hast shunned Rebellion’s way, 
And turned thy face with welcome gaze, 
To bask ’neath freedom’s holier rays, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland.

4. In sorrow bows a nation’s head, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
A tribute to thy noble dead, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
But now the trait’rous foe has fled, 
Thou’lt feel no more a despot’s tread. 
And Peace will o’er thee blessings shed, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland.

5. And when our States united are, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
When Peace usurps the place of war, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland, 
Then— through the red lips of each scar, 
Thy deeds shall beam more glorious far 
Than shines the beauteous Eve’ning Star, 
Maryland, Fair, Maryland.
