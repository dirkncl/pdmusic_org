"I Know my Mother
WEEPS FOR ME" [1863]
Song with Chorus.

I know, my mother weeps for me,
  When all the worlds is hushed in sleep,
O, soon may we the hour see,
  When mother need no longer weep;
Soon may our glorious stars and stripes,
  That blood-bought banner of the free,
Wave proudly forth from every height,
  Proclaiming peace and liberty!

1. ’Twas on a balmy summer night,
  As I lay gazing at the stars,
Thinking of home and hearts once light,
  That I had left to join the wars,
And of my mother far away,
  With step so feeble, cheek so pale,
My thoughts then dwelt upon the day
  I left her as she said Farewell.

CHORUS 1-4.
I knoe mu mother weeps for me,
  When all the world is hushed in sleep,
O, soom may we the hour see,
  When mother need no longer weep.

2. And as the midnight hour drew near,
  I fell asleep, and presently,
I dreamed I saw my mother dear
  With open arms to welcome me,
She could not speak, but O, those tears,
  That lingered in her joyful eyes,
Bespoke much more by far than lip
  Could utter to her darling boy.

3. I thought she clasped me to her heart,
  Impressed a kiss upon my brow,
And bade her sorrows all depart,
  For nought but joy is with her now,
The day light broke, and with it came,
  Sadly, the truth, ’twas but a dream,
Dear mother weep no more in vain,
  While we our native land redeem.

4. I know my mother weeps for me,
  When all the world is hushed in sleep,
O, soon may we the hour see,
  When mother need no longer weep.
Soom may our glorious stars and stripes,
  That bloodbought Banner of the Free,
Wave proudly forth from every height,
  Proclaiming peace and liberty.
