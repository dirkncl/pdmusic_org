1. Uncle Sam, wake up! wake up! 
Sure, courage never fails you, 
See the fiendish Rebels come! 
Uncle Sam, what ails you? 
Quickly, then, put forth your strength, 
Crush these heartless traitors, 
Put your foot down, firmly on 
The necks of Union haters.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Come then, Uncle Sam, wake up! 
Since courage never fails you, 
Crush all traitors, North or South! 
Uncle Sam, what ails you?

2. Confiscate their stocks and farms, 
Do it with a vigor, 
If it will our Union save, 
Confiscate the ‘NIgger!’ 
Confiscate all, everything, 
Even to their Whiskey, 
Till they find that to Rebel 
Is getting rather risky.

3. Uncle Sam, we know you’re strong
Both on land and water,
Why then with these Rebels play?
Meet them as you ought’er!
Meet them with the sword and gun;
Nor for a moment falteer,
Meet them man to man, at least,
Meet them with the halter!
