1. In days of yore old Homer wrote,
How for their Country heroes fought,
In glowing words his pages tell,
How sword in hand those heroes fell,
Greeks nowadays, are all down South,
Their deeds are done by word of mouth,
They’d fight till death surrender never,
Skedaddle yes, Skedaddle ever.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Skedaddle boys, skededdle,
That’s Greek you all must know,
Which means take to the saddle,
When e’er you see the foe!

2. When first on Sumter’s lonely tow’r,
By rebel hands in pride of pow’r,
The flag if freedom was outraged,
Legions arose and sternly gag’d
To root from out the sacred soil,
Who, freedom’s onward course would foil,
But when our serried ranks appear,
Skedaddle goes the foe in fear.

3. The clang of warfare in our ears,
Still rings and still a nation’s tears,
Pay tribute to her patriots brave
Who fell, our liberties to save,
But when this horrid strife shall cease
Our glorious flag again in peace
Throughout our happy land shall wave,
To succour, to protect, to save.
