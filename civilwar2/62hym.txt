"Here's Your Mule" (1862)
Comic Song.
Composed by C. D. Benson [of Nashville, TN]

1.
A Farmer came to camp one day,
With milk and eggs to sell,
Up on a "Male" who oft would stray,
To where no one could tell,
The Farmer tired of his tramp,
For hours was made a fool,
By ev'ry one he met in camp,
With "Mister, here's your Mule."

CHORUS
Come on, come on,
Come on old man,
And don't be made a fool,
By ev'ry one,
You meet in camp,
With "Mister here's Your Mule."

2.
His Eggs and Chickens all were gone,
He found the breath of hay,
The "Mule" was heard by all about,
That's what the Soldier's say,
And still he hunted all day long,
Alas! the witless fool,
Whil'st ev'ry one would sing the song
Of "Mister here's your Mule."

(CHORUS)

3.
The Soldier's run in laughing mood,
On mischief were intent,
They lifted "Muley" on their back,
[ ??? ]
Through this hole, and that they pushed
His head,_ And made a rule
To shout with humorous voices all
I say! "Mister here's you Mule."

(CHORUS)

4.
Alas! one day the mule was miss'd,
Ah! who could tell his fate?
The Farmer like a man bereft,
[ ??? ]
And as he passed from camp to camp,
With stricken face -- the fool,
Cried out to ev'ry one he met,
Oh! "Mister where's my Mule."

(CHORUS)
