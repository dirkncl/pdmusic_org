1. The Union, the Union we’re called on to save, 
Fall in the ranks to join our brothers brave;
Chivalry, Chivalry, Old Abe’s not a funning, 
For six hundred thousand Mudsills are coming.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Now us, us, my boys, and be tramping along;
We ne’er will return till the victory’s won;
We come from the mountains, the dells, and the hills, 
To show Southern Chivalry Northern Mudsills.

2. Coming, we are coming, Father Abe now calls;
Crush foul rebellion or gloriously fall;
Brave  Halleck, our Chieftain, with Pope in the throng,
Will lead us to conquer, so be trampling along.

3. That proud flag of freedom shall float in the breeze,
Respect it ye nations o’er land and o’er seas;
Let none dare assail it, our numbers are strong,
Who have sworn to defend it and be trampling along.

4. Remember, foul traitors, when this Flag you view,
With thirty-four stars in its Union of blue,
No star from our Union shall be suffered to fly,
They are fixed to remain like the stars in the sky.
