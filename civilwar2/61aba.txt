1. Arn, brothers, arm! for the foe is before us,
  Fill’d with deep hate to the Union we love,
Onward we press, with the loud swelling chorus,
  Striking the earth and the heav’n above!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Arm, brothers, arm! 
For the strife be ye ready,
With an eye ever steady.
Arm, brothers, arm!
Arm, brothers, arm!
Arm, brothers, arm!
Arm, brothers, arm!

2. On, brothers, on! for they haste to the battle!
  The treason is theirs whom we trusted so long;
For Freedom we fight— not man as a chattle,—
  And Union shall triumph— the Right over Wrong.

3. Haste, brothers, haste! for the moments are flying!
  An hour now lost may undo all the past!
And millions of mourners now burdened are sighing,
  And terror struck bow in the force of the blast!

4. Come, brothers, come! It is time for the starting!
  We pray on the field! At the altar they pray
Who mourn for our loss. Up, now, for the parting—
  Our children shall bless us for valor today!

5. Swear, brothers, swear! For the Union forever!
  Resting not now till each traitor is riven!
God for our land, and the Freedom the Giver.
  Onward we haste in the sunshine of heaven.
