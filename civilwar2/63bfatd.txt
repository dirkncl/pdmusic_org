1. Yonder comes a weary soldier, 
With falt’ring steps across the moor; 
Mem’ries of the past steak o’er me, 
He totters to the cottage door. 
Look, my heart cannot deceive me, 
’Tis one we deem’d on earth no more, 
Call mother, haste— do not tarry, 
For Brother’s fainting at the door. 
Call mother, haste— do not tarry, 
For Brother’s fainting at the door.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Kindly greet the weary Soldier, 
Words of comfort may restore. 
You may have an absent Brother, 
Fainting at a stranger’s door, 
You may have an absent Brother, 
Fainting at a stranger’s door.

2. Tell us brother of the battle, 
Why you were numbered with the slain; 
We who thought you lost forever, 
Now clasp you to our arms again. 
Oh, my otherers share the blessing 
Which heaven kindly keeps in store, 
May they meet their absent loved ones, 
Aye, e’n though fainting at the door. 
May they meet their absent love ones, 
Aye, e’en though fainting at the door.

3. I was wounded and a pris’ner, 
Our ranks were broken, forced to fly; 
Thrown withing a gloomy dungeon, 
Away from friends alone to die. 
Still the hope we strange within me, 
A cherished hope that would restore, 
I have lived by heaven’s blessing 
To meet my loved ones at the door. 
I have lived by heavens blessing, 
To meet my loved ones at the door.
