1.
How dear to each heart was the star spangled Banner,
When equity spread out its folds to the gaze,
And God favor'd people united hosanna,
Shouted Union for ever and Heaven the praise.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
'Mid the mad clouds of fury,
A Lone Star of Glory,
Like a beacon of hope on a surge crested sea;
Shone forth in a halo all crimson and gory,
And the Palmetto Flag was unfurled to the free.

2.
But tyranny clad in the robe of devotion
Was perched on that banner in envious flight
And spread fer dark wing o'er a land in commotion,
And mocked at our freedom our justice and right.

3.
Like the daughters of Atlas that shine in the heaven
In dearest communion of any above,
These fair brilliant stars, the Confederate 'leven,
Shall reflect from our flag our union and love.

4.
Adieu to that star spangled Banner for ever,
Its once joyful folds are now trailing in dust
The ties that endeared it in sorrow we sever
And give to the flag that redeemed us our trust.
