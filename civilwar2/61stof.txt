1.
Hail that great and glorious Banner,
 Emblem of the brave and free;
'Neath its folds we'll fight forever,
 'Tis the Flag of Liberty!
'Tis our Nation's glorious Standard
 To defend-- in God we trust
'Round its hallowed folds we'll rally
 Onward, and to conquer must.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Now to HIM, with hearts elated,
 Here we offer up our prayer,
As in the past, so in the future,
 Freedom's blessings, all may share!

2.
Let no traitor's hand e'er sell soil it,
 For 'tis Freedom's Flag we wave,
Rally Sons resolved to save it,
 Or tp fill a Patriot's grave.
'Neath the Flag our Sires rallied,
 Led by WASHINGTON, the brave,
A NAME so cherished, will inspire us,
 The Union and our Flag to save!

3.
Let death to traitors be our motter,
 Marching on to meet the foe,
The God of battles, will sustain us,
 Crush Rebellion at a blow.
Now the warlike bugle calls us,
 Raise the Stars and Stripes on high;
Let BUNKER HILL and ORLEANS nerve us
 To save our Country or to die.
