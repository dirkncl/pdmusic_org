1. The midnight wind is sighing 
So mournfully, so strange,
With a wild uncertain music;
I would not have it change,
And ’mid its spiral numbers,
There floats a dim regret,
That echos to my whisper:
I will not quite forget.

2. Pleasant have been the hours
That found us side by side,
Yet like a wreath of flowers.
Their memories have died;
The midnight wind is stealing
O’er my spirit still— and yet
I hear the answering echo—
“I will not quite forget.”

3. Forget and then— when twilight
Throws her mantle o’er the earth,
When in the cloudless heavens,
The silverstars have birth,
That once ’neath such a heaven
In days gone by we met;
Then echo with the midnight wind,
“I will not quite forget.”
