1. I canno mind my wheel, Mother,
I cannot mind my wheel;
You know not what my heart must know,
You know not what I feel.
My thread is idly cast, Mother,
My thouht is o’er the sea;
My hopes are fading fast, Mother,
Yet feel you not for me.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
I cannot mind my wheel, Mother,
I cannot mind my wheel;
You know not what my heart must know,
You know not what I feel.

2. I had a dreadful dream, Mother,
’Twas of a ship at sea;
I saw a form amidst the storm,
I heard him call on me.
I heard him call on me, Mother,
As plain as not I speak.
I thought my brain would burst, Mother,
I though my heart would break.

3. For me he perils life, Mother,
The weary ocean wide,
And yet a word, one word from you
Had kept him at my side.
My wheel had gaily sped, Mother,
My thoughts at home smil’d free;
But now my smiles have fled, Mother,
My heart is o’er the sea.
