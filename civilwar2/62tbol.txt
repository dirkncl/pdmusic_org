1.
At early dawn the roll of the drum,
The bugle's shrill alarms,
The pickets warned our foes had come
And summoned us to arms.
The sun just rising from the flood
Flecked earth's majestic arch
As our battalion ready stood
To meet them on their march,
To meet them,
To meet them,
To meet them on their march.

CHORUS [sung after verses 1 & 2]
Then let it be the battle cry
Of all men our freemen brave.
For liberty we'll do or die,
And our free country save,
And our,
And our,
And our country save.

2.
Onward their legions came to feel
How bravely freemen fight,
For man to man, and steel to steel
We drove from morn till night.
The air filled with fiery sleet
Which thickened on the field
Until, amidst the battle's beat,
Our men were forced to yield,
Our men,
Our men,
Our men were forced to yield.

3.
The conflict ceased at set of sun,
And banished treason's horde.
The wreath of victory was wan
And peace again restored.
Then ended in defeat and rout,
A base and lawless band
Whose fustian flag no more shall float
Above this freeborn land,
Above,
Above,
Above this freeborn land.

CHORUS
Forever float our banner bright
Above this freeborn land.
And freemen say with truth and right,
It shall forever stand,
It shall,
It shall,
It shall forever stand.
