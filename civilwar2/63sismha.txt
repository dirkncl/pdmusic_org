1. The moon was softly beaming 
Upon the tented ground. 
Its silver light was streaming, 
O’er the dying men around. 
A soldier weak and wounded 
Whose form was filled with pain, 
Said smiling to his comrades, 
Shall I see my home again. 
Home! Home! shall I see my home again.

CHORUS 1
Home! Home! shall I see my home again, 
Said smiling to his comrades
Shall I see my home again.

2. The silent guard was keeping
His watch o’er friend and foe;
The wind seemed sadly weeping,
And murmured soft and low;
It breathed upon a cottage
Half hid by yellow grain.
It whispered of a mother
Whom he ne’er would see again;
No! no! whom he ne’er would see again.

CHORUS 2
No! no! whom he ne’er would see again.
It whispered of a mother
Whom he ne’er would see again.

3. His comrades turned in sadness,
There last good bye was given,
For while he smiled in gladness,
His soul had passed to heaven;
A hero! brave and noble,
Who lived without a stain;
His country mourns in anguish;
Yet he sees his home again.
Home! home! yet he sees his home again.

CHORUS 3
Home! home! yet he sees his home again.
His country mourns in anguish
Yet he sees his home again.
