[CHORUS]
Hail to thee chieftan, we greet thee, we greet thee,
Wuth shout and with song, we swell the huzza.
This hour of trial has learned us to love thee,
You’ve a home in our hearts the dwelling afar.

Look, look to the south, see the despots uniting,
To trample down rights our fathers decreed.
Stand, stand to the right we’ll continue the fighting,
We’ll press on to vict’ry wheree’er you lead.
Winds waft the tidings, the people shall govern,
We strke in defence of that God given right.
Hills give echo, the people are sov’reign,
And will stand by our chief, our flag and this right.

[Repeat CHORUS]
