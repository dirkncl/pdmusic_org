1.
What though the fair bright morning sky,
 Is fleck'd with battle smoke,
Shall stifling heat of cannon's breath,
 Our patriot voices choke?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
No, by the scars our fathers have worn,
 By the banners our sons have borne,
No, by the faith that we have sworn,
 No, by our Liberty!

2.
What though wild waters beat amain,
 And tempests surge and roar,
Shall ships of line, with sails all furl'd,
 Lie idle at the shore?

3.
What thoug at home are voices dumb,
 And hearts that idly beat,
Shall loyal lips their use forget,
 Nor battle song repeat?

4.
What though across the sea there comes
 A voice that's hoarse and low,
Shall stop the beating of our drums
 Or check emotion's glow?

5.
What though we bear the booming guns,
 And shrill the bugles play,
Fear we or death or battle-field,
 This glorious battle-day?
