1. There was a little woman as I’ve heard tell,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
She went to market eggs for to sell,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
She went to market on market day.
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
She fell asleep upon the big highway,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!

2. There came along a peddler, his name was Stout,
  Follol liddle loldy h’m!
He cut her petticoat all round about,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
He cut her petticoat off to her knees,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
And left the little womon in the cold for to freeze,
  Follol liddle loldy h’m!

3.  When the little woman began to awake,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
She be  gan to shiver and she began to shake,
  Follol liddle lol dy h’m!
Her knees began to freeze and she began to cry—
  Follol liddle loldy h’m!
Lord ’a massy on me, I’m sure ’taint I!
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!

4. And if it    is I,  I, I soon will see,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
For I’ve got a dog a little dog at home, and he’ll know me;
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
And if ’taint I, he’ll bark and wail,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
And if ’tis I, he’ll wag his little tail.
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!

5.  Home went the little woman all in the dark,
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
Out came the little dog and he began to bark!
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
The dog began to bark, and she began to cry—
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
Lord a massy on me, I know ’taint I!
  Fol lol liddle loldy h’m!
