1. I Simon Greenhorn, went to town,
  Alooking fine and gay sirs,
Of New York City, that great renown,
  I’d often heard folks say sirs;
My Daddy’s leave I got ’tis true,
  My Mammy’s approbation,
So I went down to New York town
  To see the Evacuation.*
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ria,
Ritu, ritu, roli do,
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ritu,
  And Yankee Doodle-ation!

2. When in the City I first arrived,
  I felt myself quite fluster’d,
To see all round that great big town
  So many people muster’d;
But howsomeever in a crowd
  I got myself a station,
And then awaited patiently
  To see the Evacuation.*
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ria,
Ritu, ritu, roli do,
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ritu,
  Hurrah! for this great nation!

3. At length a soldier’s scampering horse
  Got frightened at a dandy—
He pelted in among the crowd
  Quite frolicsom and handy;
He tilted me slap off my soles,
  I popped on an elevation,
And got a seat for nothing at all,
  To see the Evacuation.*
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ria,
Ritu, ritu, roli do,
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ritu,
  Oh! what a happy station!

4. I sat myself down quietly,
  Nobody seemed to rout me;
I gently cast my eyes upon
  The ladies round about me;
They all did look quite weary worn
  And in a perspiration;
It melted all the red and white,
  On this famous Evacuation.*
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ria,
Ritu, ritu, roli do,
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ritu,
  Ever of them.

5. “Now thinks,” says I unto myself,
  “I’ve seen all that I can see;”
But to find out my great mistake,
  I paid dearly for my fancy—
Ten dollars and my pocketbook,
  Upon examination;
My watch, that never went before,
  Went on Evacuation!*
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ria,
Ritu, ritu, roli do,
Ritu, ritu, ritu, ritu,
  I’d like a police station!
