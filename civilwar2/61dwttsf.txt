1. Some of the bright and glorious land
Where freedom first did find a home,
Arouse and with avenging hand
Consign the traitors in their doom.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Down with the traitors’ Serpent flag,
Death to the wretch o’er whom it waves
And let our heaven born banner float,
O’er freemens’ homes and traitors’ graves.

2. No forreign foe assails us now,
No tyrant from a distant shore,
In reverence all the nations bow
And friendship from our hands implore.

3. But vipers whom our fire hath warm’d
And wretches whom our hand had fed
Have dared tear down our Nation’s flag
And raise their Ensign in its stead.

4. Our fathers fought for liberty
From an oppressive enemy
We fight as they did to be free
From the foul yoke of slavery.

5. In arrogance and proud disdain
The tyrants lord it o’er the south,
But never, never, can they reign
O’er the freemen of Northern birth.
