1. Oh! de Yanks hab come and gone and went,
And done it down in Dixie,
And de massa take de galls and run away;
Oh, dey play de berry cloben foot around in dis bicinity,
And dey gib de darkeys all a hollerday. Oh!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
High times, good times, down in massa’s kichum,
Dis chile he gain jes seben pouns a day. Oh!
Filllima, lilllima, boo, hurrah,
I’se gwine to be a gin’ral,
Oh! dats what all de Yankee sojers say.

2. Oh, ole massa say he wish he know,
Which side would get a lickin,
Den he know prezactly what de word to say;
But he awful fighten when he hear,
De Yanks hab come for certainty,
Den he tink his health so poor he couldn’t stay. Oh!

3. Oh, dey said dat when de Yankees come,
Dey’d lick dem all to pieces,
But I tink de lickin’s all de oder way,
Dis yere chile hab seen some runnin
But dat beat his whole consperiance,
As de courthouse says ’twas done wid out delay. Oh!

4. Deres Clem, and Lem, and Pomp and Tom,
An Titus all a dancin,
And ole Egypt’s took de fiddle for to play,
Dis darkies feet wont keep de parallagram unticalar,
Case dey want to celabrate dis holley day. Oh!
