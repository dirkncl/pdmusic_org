1. A song for our flag,
A song for out band,
A song for the brave and the free!
The Motto we wear,
United we stand,
Tried and true loyal comrades are we.
United in heart,
United in hand,
A Union that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom forever.

CHORUS 1
United in heart,
United in hand,
A Union that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom for ever.

2. Unfurl the old flag,
Let it float far on high,
The chorus exalting ascend.
While one star remains,
We conquer or die,
By the banner we dare  to defend.
No cowardly heart,
No traitorous hand
Mars the Union that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom for ever.

CHORUS 2
No cowardly heart,
No trait torous hand
Mars the Union that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom for ever.

3. Wher’er it may wave,
Our own standart sheet,
By mountain or river or sea,
We press on the march,
With unwearied feet,
While the gleam of its starlight we see,
Here is to our friends,
A health and a hand,
Remembrance that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom for ever.

CHORUS 3
Here is to our friends,
A health and a hand,
Remembrance that time cannot sever.
A shout for our flag,
A shout for our band,
Our Honor and freedom for ever.

4. We’re all for the north,
For the south too we are,
United unchanged evermore,
No Palmetto flag,
For us no lone star,
But the stripes and the old thirty four,
Keep step to the song,
Be it right, be it wrong,
No state can the Union dissever.
Hurrah for the stars,
Hurrah for the stripes,
The Union, the Union forever.

CHORUS 4
Keep step to the song,
Be it right, be it wrong,
No state can the Union dissever.
Hurrah for the stars,
Hirrah for the stripes,
The Union, the union for ever.
