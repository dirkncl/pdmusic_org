1. Oh! ye patriots to the battle,
Hear Fort Moultrie’s cannon rattle;
Then away, then away, then away to the fight!
Go meet those Southern Traitors,
With iron will,
And should your courage falter, boy,
Remember Bunkey Hill, 

[REFRAIN (sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
The Stars and Stripes forever!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Our Union shall not sever!

2. As our fathers crushed oppression,
Deal with those who breathe Secession;
Then away, then away, then away to the fight!
Though Beauregard and Wigfall
Their swords may whet,
Just tell them Major Anderson
Has not surrendered yet.

3. Is Virginia, too, seceding?
Washington’s remains unheeding?
Then away! then away! then away to the fight!
Unfold our country’s banner
In triumph there,
And let the rebels desecrate
That banner if they dare.

4. Volunteers, be up and doing,
Still the good old path pursuing;
Then away, then away, then aawy to the fight!
Your sires, who fought before you;
Had led the way.
Then follow in their footsteps,
And be as brave as they.

5. On! ye patriots to the battle,
Hear Fort Moultrie’s cannon rattle;
Then away, then away, then away to the fight.
The star that lights our Union
Shall never set!
Though fierce may be the conflict,
We’ll gain the victory yet.
