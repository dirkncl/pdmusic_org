1. God, save our native land
From every treach’rous band
  Who would invade!
Shield us by night and day,
With Heavens holy ray;
Let all Disuion’s sway
  Be quick allayed.

2. Who would ungrateful prove
To thy unceasing love
  For out blest land?
May we e’er look to Thee
When in adversity;
For all prosperity
  Is by Thy hand.

3. Let not a traitor base
Our native land deface
With deeds unkind;
In our confed’racy
May we as brothers be,
Ever dear land, in thee
  Peace may we find.

4. Union, forevermore,
Echo from shore to shore
In anthem grand!
God, with Thy power and might,
Keeo our loved banner bright,
With ev’ry Star to light
  Our glorious land.
