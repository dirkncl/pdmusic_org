1. A woman, true, I am, yet who isn’t that dare say,
I am not up and doing in God’s cause?
Though I sit alone at home ever working night and day, 
Ever stiching for our Brave without pause
’Tis my fingers ply the work, for my heart is in the war,
Enlisted in the gallant fourtyfourth,
  Hurrah! hurrah hurrah!
To the brave and gallant fortyfourth hurrah!
To the brave and gallant fortyfourth hurrah!
  hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

2. No bounty has my love, he has buckled on his sword
In defense of our country and of right!
He has given up his soul to the keeping of the Lord;
For “Liberty and Union” he will fight!
With a prayer upon his lips he has left me for the war,
Enlisted in the gallant fortyfourth,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
To the brave and gallant fortyfourth Hurrah!
To the brave and gallant fortyfourth, hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

3. His strong arm will strike cor two, love will make him twice a man,
He’ll stand or fail for Freedom or for me!
He is brave who woman loves, such a soldier never ran
“Forward!” is his cry ’tis death or liberty!
In the battle’s fiercest din, I shall hear his voice from far,
As he shouts our fourty fourth has won,
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
As he shouts, our fortyfourth has won, Hurrah!
As he shouts, our fortyfourth has won, hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
