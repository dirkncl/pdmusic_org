1. Ah! what scenes to me appear,
Which entranced I fondly view;
’Tis my home and friends so dear,
I behold in joy anew.
Where the bood stained fields no more,
Shall I see with dread and pain;
And the cannon’s thund’ring roar
I may never hear again,
  And the cannon’s thun’ring roar
  I may never hear again.

2. As I view these scenes so dear,
Which with rapture fill the heart;
Happy ones are clus’ring near,
Voices sweet, new joys im part.
Faces now with radiant light,
Beam with joy and smile with love;
Sparkling eyes with lustre bright
Far outshine the stars above,
  Sparkling eyes with lustre bright,
  Far outshine the stars above.

3. Songs upon my ear now fall,
Which I ever loved to hear;
And again do I recall
Hours of joy and moments dear.
As I fondly gaze around,
Boyhood scenes to me appear;
Here the bliss of earth is found
Gladly would I linger here,
  Here the bliss of earth is found,
  Gladly would I linger here.
