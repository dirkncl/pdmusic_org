"The Stripes and the Stars" (1861)
Words and Music by George A. Mietike

1.
O star spangled banner!
The flag of our pride,
Though trampled by traitors, and basely defied,
Fling out to the glad winds your Red, White, and Blue,
For the heart of the Northland is beating for you,
And her strong arm is never in strike with a will,
'Till the foe and his boastings are humbled and still!
Here's welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

CHORUS ad libitum
Here's welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

2.
From prairie, O, plowman! speed boldly away.
There's seed to be sown in God's furrows today;
How landward lose fisher? stout woodman come home,
let smith leave his anvil, and weaver his loom,
And hamlet and city ring loud with the cry,
For God and our country we'll fight 'till we die!
Here's welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

CHORUS ad libitum
Here's welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

3.
Invincible banner! the flag of the free,
O, where treads the foot that would falter for thee!
Or the hands to be folded 'till triumph is won
And the Eagle looks proud as old to the sun!
Give tears for the parting a murmur of prayer,
Then forward, the fame of our standard to share!
With welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

CHORUS ad libitum
With welcome to wounding, and combat and scars,
And the glory of death for the stripes and stars.

4.
O God of our fathers! this banner must shine,
Where battle is hottest, in warfare divine;
The cannon has thunder'd, the bugle has blown,
We fear not the summons we fight not alone!
O lead us, 'till wide from the gulf to the sea,
The land shall be sacred to freedom and thee!
With love for opression with blessing for scars;
One country, one banner, the stripes and stars.

CHORUS ad libitum
With love for oppression with blessing for scars;
One country, one banner, the stripes and stars.
