1. Of all the flags that float aloft 
O’er Neptune’s gallant tars, 
That wave on high in victory, 
Above the sons of Mars, 
Give us the flag, Columbia’s flag, 
The emblem of the free, 
Whose flashing stars blazed thro’ our wars, 
For truth and liberty. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then dip it, lads, in ocean’s brine, 
And give it three times three; 
And fling it out, ’mid song and shout, 
The Banner of the Sea.

2. Beneath its folds we fear no foe, 
Our hearts shall never quail, 
With bosoms bare the storm we’ll dare, 
And broave the battle gale, 
And tho’ the cannon plow our decks, 
The planks run red with gore, 
Still thro’ the fray all shall obey 
That flag forevermore.

3. On ev’ry wave, on ev’ry shore 
Columbia’s flag shall go, 
And thro’ all time its fame sublime, 
With brighter hues shall glow; 
For Freedom’s standard is our flag, 
Its Guardians Freedom’s sons 
And woe betide the insulter’s pride, 
When we unloose our guns.

4. Its enemies our own shall be; 
Upon the land or main, 
Its starry light shall gild the fight, 
And guide its Iron Rain; 
Nor foreign pow’r, nor treason’s arts 
Shall shake our Patriot love 
While with our life in peace or strife, 
We’ll keep that flag above.
