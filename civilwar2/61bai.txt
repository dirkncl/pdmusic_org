1. The moon had just gone down, sir,
  But the stars lit up the sky;
All was still in tent and town, sir,
  Not a Rebel could we spy!
It was our turn at picket,
So we march’d into the thicket,
To the music of the cricket,
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  Chirping nigh.

2. O we kept a sharp look out, sir,
  On Munson frownin’ nigh,
But no Rebel bein’ about, sir,
  We sat down there by and by;
And we watched the brook a brawlin’.
And counted stars a’ fallin’,
Old memories overhaulin’,
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  Bill and I.

3. And says he, “Won’t it be glorious
  When we fling our muskets by,
And home again victorious,
  We hear our sweethearts cry
Welcome back”— A step! Who goes there?
A shot! By Heaven, the foe’s there!
Bill sat there all composure,
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  Bill not I.

4. By the red light of his gun, sir,
  I marked the Rebel spy.
In an instant it was done, sir,
  I had fired and heard a cry.
I sprang across the stream, sir,
O it seems just like a dream, sir,
The dizzy, dying gleam, sir,
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  Of that eye.

5. A youth— a very boy, sir,
  I saw before me lie;
Some pretty schoolgirl’s toy, sir,
  Had ventured there to die.
We had hated one another,
Yet I heard him murmur “Mother,”
So I stooped and called him “Brother”—
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  No reply.

6. I crossed the stream once more, sir,
  To see why Bill warn’t by—
He was leanin‘ as before, sir,
  But a film was o’er his eye.
I scarce knew what it meant, sir,
Till a wail broke from our tent, sir,
As into camp we went, sir,
[Refrain, repeated 4 times]
  Bill and I.
