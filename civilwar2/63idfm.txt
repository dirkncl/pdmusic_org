1.
At summer's eve when all is still,
I wander to the rill
Where birds around like spirits blest,
Flit and are at rest.
I sit beneath our trysting tree,
And dream sweet love of thee.
And here upon the mimic shore,
I'd dream forever more;
Yes here upon the mimic shore,
I'd dream forever more.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I'd dream, (I'd dream,) I'd dream, (I'd dream,)
I'd dream forever more;
Yes here upon the mimic shore,
I'd dream forever more.

2.
And as the waters seem to sing,
With too sweet murmurings,
I watch the twilight shades appear,
And think that thou are near.
'Tis all a dream of love to me,
A dream sweet love of thee,
And of the happy days before,
I'd dream forever more;
Yes of the happy days before,
I'd dream forever more.

3.
The night floats on-- o'er yonder hill
I hear the gushing rill,
In distant murmurs soft and low
As if to bid me go.
A linger still beside the tree
And fondly dream of thee
Of thus upon the mimic shore,
I'd dream forever more--
Yes, thus upon the mimic shore,
I'd dream forever more.
