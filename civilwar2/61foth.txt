"Flag of the Heroes" (Union and Liberty) (1861)
Words by O. W. Holms,
Music by Charles E. Kimball.

1.
Flag of the heroes who left us their glory,
Borne thro' their battlefields' thunder and flame,
Blazon'd in song and illumined in story,
Wave o're us all who inherit their fame!

CHORUS
Up with our banner bright,
Sprinkled with starry light,
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore,
While thro' the sounding sky
Loud rings the Nation's cry,--
Union and Liberty!
One everymore!

2.
Light of our firmament, guide of our Nation,
Prode of her children, honored afar,
Let the wide beams of thy full constellation
Scatter each cloud that would darken a star!

(CHORUS)

3.
Empire unsceptred! what foe shall assail thee,
Bearing the standard of Liberty's van!
Think not the God of thy father's shall fail thee,
Striving with men for the birthright of man!

(CHORUS)

4.
Yet if, by madness and treachery blighted,
Dawns the dark hour when the sword thou must draw,
Then, with the arms of thy millions united,
Smite the bold traitors to Freedom and Law!

(CHORUS)

5.
Lord of the Universe! shield us and guide us,
Trusting Thee always, thro' shadow and sun!
Thou hast united us, who shall divide us?
Keep us, oh, keep us, the MANY IN ONE!
