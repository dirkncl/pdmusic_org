(with "How the Soldier Talks!")]

1. There’s a cry sweeps o’er the land—
  Shoulder arms!
Who will now a coward stand,
  Shoulder arms!
While the country needs his aid!
 Cowardice for fools was made.
There’s a cry sweeps o’er the land—
  Shoulder arms!
Whose afraid to meet the foe?
Who would see the flag laid low,
In the dust by traitors base?
Let him hide his face.
Who would win a soldier’s fame?
  Shoulder arms!
Who would bear a hero’s name?
  Shoulder arms!
Let him raise his strong arm high,
Now to strike or now to die—
Who would win a soldier’s fame?
  Shoulder arms!

2. Onward! onward to the van!
  Shoulder arms!
Onward like a fearless man!
  Shoulder arms!
Stamd not like one deaf and dumb,
While you hear the appealing drum.
Onward onward! to the van!
  Shoulder arms!
See the rebel ranks advance,
Wake men from your guilty trance!
’Tis the time for action deep,
Not the hour for sleep.
God will bless the works you do.
  Shoulder arms!
He will lead you safely through,
  Shoulder arms!
Ev’ry peril while you fight,
’Gainst the wrong t’uphold the right,
God will bless the work you do.
  Shoulder arms!
