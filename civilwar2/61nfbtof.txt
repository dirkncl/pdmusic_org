1. No flag but the old flag— the red, white and blue,
With the stars of a Union unbroken and true;
A rise and defend it! ye sons of the brave,
Whose blood bought the banner your valor must save,
Whose blood bought the banner your valor must save. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The old flag, the dear flag, the red, white and blue;
We rise to defend it and prove ourselves true.
The old flag, the dear flag, the flag which you see,
We’re ready to die for the flag of the free.

2. Wo! wo! to the traitor who drags to the mire
The flag crimsoned deep with the blood of his ire,
If he rouse up the legions on land and on sea,
Who are ready to die for the flag of the free,
Who are ready to die for the flag of the free. 

3. Up! up with the Stars and the Stipes, and go forth
To save our great Union brave men of the North!
Nor rest till the Star Spangled Banner you see
Tri umphantly float from the Palmetto tree!
Triumphantly float from  the Palmetto tree! 

4. God bless the old flag: as He ever hath done,
Since He strenthened the arm of our own Washington;
And God bless the freemen, devoted and true,
Who are ready to die for the Red, White and Blue!
Who are ready to die for the Red, White and Blue!
