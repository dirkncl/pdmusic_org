1. Oh my Dear your eyes look red— 
was it weeping made them red? 
Is it anguish bows your heads; 
yes sad tears you’ve shed. 
for too many were misled! 
Look all round what Blood is shed 
and how many Heroes dead? 
We deplore the dead!

CHORUS 1
And how many Heroes dead 
We deplore the dead!

2. Civil war made you so white, 
pale and white alas whatsight. 
You are working day and night 
for the Union’s right! 
Mark it yet, not all are dead! 
No! the Spirit can’t be dead 
for we still shall go ahead 
and avenge the dead!

CHORUS 2
Yes we still shall go ahead 
and avenge the dead!

3. Forward march the Union cries, 
down with all exciting lies. 
For more patri ots shall rise, 
more such men shall rise! 
Satisfaction there and here! 
Be not mild when traitors sneer— 
Did you of their slaughters hear? 
Statements prove it here!

CHORUS 3
Oh what cruel Warfare! Hear! 
Statements prove it here!

4. Letters! News! in mourning style, 
different language, different style. 
Better news must come meanwhile 
in another style. 
Patriots must not forbear! 
when the traitors vengeance swear. 
Courage Forward! take the ground. 
Union States are bound!—

CHORUS 4
Courage then but take their ground, 
OUR LAND is sound!

5. Don’t be sad oh pray my Dear! 
EVER for the Union cheer 
Vic’tries here and conquests there 
OURS be the share 
Heart consoling News are here 
for the Suffering far and near 
Bear in mind the Latest Friend 
Warfare at an End! 

CHORUS 5
Thanks to Patriots do send— 
For the Warfare’s end.

6. Treacherous enemies have fled! 
Yes they left the Roses red. 
All the States together wed 
and bring roses red 
but their Wedding dresses bright 
show the purest Lilies White 
We’ll protect it day and night 
Now the States are right! 

CHORUS 6
For we hate a Brothers fight— 
Let us ALL do right.

7. All the eyes they shall prove true 
golden stars in Heaven’s Blue 
Freedom’s Son Oh splendid view 
on our Flag’s true Blue. 
Heaven’s Blue and Lilies White 
with the roses Red unite 
RECONCILED we’ll plant a tree 
growing for the Free! 

CHORUS 7
Reconciled at Freedom’s Day— 
What a grand Display.

8. Union Women! Union Boys! 
Union States in Wedding Joys! 
Cheer with me Such Triumphs come 
when the Task is done! 
Then our children and our Land 
will for future Glory stand 
GOD of Liberty be thanked! 
MAY GOD SAVE OUR LAND! 

CHORUS 8
Brothers! Sisters! Hand in Hand 
GOD PROTECT OUR LAND!
