1. 
In Uncle Sam’s Dominion, in Eighteen Sixty-one,
The fight between Secession and Union was begun;
The South declared they’d have the “rights” which Uncle Sam denied.
Or in their Seccesh Wag-on they’d all take a ride!

REFRAIN and CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hurrah! for the wagon, the old Union wagon.
We'll stick to our wagon, and all take a ride!

2.
The makers of our wagon were men of solid wit,
They made it our of Chartertick that would not get it split.
Its wheels are of material, the strongest and the best,
And two are named the North and South, and two the East and West.

3.
Our wagon _bed_ is strong enough for any “revolution”
In fact, ’tis the “hull” of the “old Constitution,”
Her coupling’s strong, her axle’s long, and any where you get her,
No Monarch’s frown can “bark her down”— no Traitor can _upset_ her.

4.
This good old Union wagon, the nation all admired;
Her wheels had run for four score years and never once been “_tired_,”
Her passengers were happy as along her way she whirled,
For the good old Union Wagon was the glory of the world!

5.
But when old Abraham took command, the South wheel got displeased
Because the _public fat_ was gone that kept her axle greased;
And when he gathered up the reins and started on his route,
She plunged into seccession and knocked some “fellers” out!

6.
Now while in this seccession mire the wheel was sticking slightly
Some Tory passengers got mad and curses the driver slightly;
But Abraham “couldn’t see it”— so he didn’t heed their clatter—
There's too much _black mud_ on the wheel, says he— “_that’ what’s the matter_.”

7.
So Abram gave them notice that in eighteen sixty-three,
Unless the rebels “dried it up,” he’d set their niggers free;
And then the man that led the van to fight against the nation,
Would drop his gun and _home_ he’d run, to fight against _starvation_.

8.
When Abram said he’d free the slaves that furnished their supplies
It opened Northern traitors’ _mouths_ and Southern traitor’s eyes.
“The slaves,” said they, “will run away if you thus rashly free them.”
But Abram Guessed, perhaps they’d best _go home and oversee them!_”

9.
Around our Union wagon, with shoulders to the wheel,
A million soldiers rally, with hearts as true as steel;
And of all the Generals, high or low, that help to save the nation,
There’s none that strikes a harder blow than _General Emancipation!_
