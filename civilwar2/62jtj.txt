1. It don’t seem hardly fair, John,
  When both my hands was full,
To stump me to a fight, John,
  Your cousin, tu, John Bull!
      Ole Uncle S, sez he, “I guess
      We know it now,” sez he,
      “The  lion’s paw is all the law.
      Accordin’ to J. B.,
      That’s fit for you an’ me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ole Uncle S. sez he, “I guess
We know it now,” sez he
“The lion’s paw is all the law,
Accordin‘ to J. B.,
Thet’s fit for you an’ me!

2. Who made the law thet hurts, John,
  Heads I win,— ditto, tails?
“J. B.“. was on his shirts, John,
  Unless my memory fails.
      Ole Uncle S. sez he, “I guess,
      (I’m good at thet,) sez he,
      “Thet sauce for goose ain’t jest the juice
      For ganders with J. B.
      No more than you or me!”

3. We own the ocean, tu, John:
  You mus’n’t take it hard,
Ef we can’t think with you John,
  It’s just your own backyard.
    Ole Uncle S. sez he, “I guess,
    Ef thet’s his claim,” sez he,
    “The fencin’stuff’’ll cost enough
    To bust up friend J. B.,
    Ez wal ez you an’ me!”

4. We give the critters back, John,
  Coz Abrams thought ’twas right;
It wasn’t your bullyin’ clack, John,
  Provokin’ us to fight.
    Ole Uncle S. sez he, “I guess
    We’ve a hard row,”Ì sez he,
    “To hoe jest now; but thet, somehow,
    May heppen to J. B.,
    Ez wal ez you an’ me!”

5. Shall it be love or hate, John?
  It’s you thet’s to decide;
Ain’t your bonds held by Fate, John,
  Like all the world’s beside?
      Ole Uncle S. sez he, “I guess
      Wise men forgive,” sez he
      “But men forgive; an’ sometime yet
      Thet truth may strike J. B.,
      Ex wal ex you an’ me!”
