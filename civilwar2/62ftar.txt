1. Our land is broad, our King is God;
  We’re nerved with youthful might,
We’ll stand, we’ll hie, we’ll do, we’ll die,
  For Freedom, Truth and Right,
      For Freedom, Truth and Right we stand,
        For Freedom, Truth and Right;
      A nation in one mighty band,
        For Freedom, Truth and Right.

CHORUS 1
For Freedom, Truth and Right we stand,
  For Freedom, Truth and Right,
A nation in one mighty band,
  For Freedom, Truth and Right.

2. Our silvery stars, our sanguine bars,
  Show Earth our heart’s troth plight,
We’re wedded now, by ev’ry vow,
  To Freedom, Truth and Right,
      To Freedom, Truth and Right we’re wed,
        To Freedom, Truth and Right;
      And on through life our way we tread,
        With Freedom, Truth and Right.

CHORUS 2
To Freedom, Truth and Right we’re wed,
  To Freedom, Truth and Right,
And on through life our way we tread,
  With Freedom, Truth and Right.

3. On every sea our flag shall be
  A herald of delight,
And ne’er shall wave above the grave
  Of Freedom, Truth and Right.
      Aye, Freedom’s face its folds shall fan,
        And Truth shall clothe with might,
      We’ll know no clan but brother man,
        And Freedom, Truth and Right.

CHORUS 3
Aye, Freedom’s face its folds shall fan,
   And Truth shall clothe with might,
We’ll know no clan but brother man,
   And Freedom, Truth and Right.

4. With these secured, we sheath the sword,
  And wage but “the good fight,”
We know no foe, unless he go
  ’Gainst Freedom, Truth and Right.
      For these we’ll deal th’avenging blow;
        God grant it ne’er be slight;
      This too the foe whoe’er shall go
         ’Gainst Freedom, Truth and Right.
CHORUS 4
For these we’ll deal th’avenging blow;
  God grant it ne’er be slight;
This too the foe whoe’er shall go
  ’Gainst Freedom, Truth and Right.

5. Of diverse kind, we’re one in mind,
  And mark, with single sight,
How, with one aim, all men should claim,—
  Gain Freedom, Truth and Right.
    Freedom and Truth and Right for all!
      Ho! Freedom, Truch and Right!
    For none the thrall! oppression fall,
      ’Fore Freedom, Truth and Right!

CHORUS 5
Freedom and Truth and Right for all!
  Ho! Freedom, Truch and Right!
For none the thrall! oppression fall,
  ’Fore Freedom, Truth and Right!

6. The earth we’ll bore, the deep exlore,
  Fain e’en the mountain’s height,
But ne’er forget our watch to set
  O’er Freedom, Truth and Right.
      Aye, Freedom, Truth and Right we’ll guard
        Guard Freedom, Trueth and Right,
      Ne’er be debarred our watch and ward
        O’er Freedom, Truth and Right.

CHORUS 6
Aye, Freedom, Truth and Right we’ll guard
  Guard Freedom, Trueth and Right,
Ne’er be debarred our watch and ward
  O’er Freedom, Truth and Right.

7. In hopes we’re rich; in memories which
  Our history’s pages light,
Of hearts, now dead, that beat and bled
  For Freedom, Truth and Right.
    For Freedom, Truth and Right they bled,
      For Freedom, Truth and Right,
    Brave hearts, now death, ye beat and bled
      For Freedom, Truth and Right!

CHORUS 7
For Freedom, Truth and Right they bled,
  For Freedom, Truth and Right,
Brave hearts, now death, ye beat and bled
  For Freedom, Truth and Right!

8. Our faith in thee blest trinity,
  No heresy shall blight;
We’re one in love, with God above,
  And Freedom, Truth and Right!
    In Freedom, Truth and Right we’re one,
      In Freedom, Truth and Right;
    We’re one in love, with God above,
      And Freedom, Truth and Right!

CHORUS 8
In Freedom, Truth and Right we’re one,
  In Freedom, Truth and Right;
We’re one in love, with God above,
  And Freedom, Truth and Right!
