1. [1st Voice]
Mother! can this the glory be
Of which men proudly tell
When speaking of the fearless ones
Who in the battle fell,
Who in the battle fell.
Where is the light that gave our home
its sun shine and its joy?
Ours was they say the victory
But where thy noble boy?
Ours was they say the victory
But where thy noble, noble boy?
[2nd Voice]
My boy I see him in my dreams,
I hear I hear this battle cry,
I know his brave and loyal heart,
he does not fear to die;
he does not fear to die;
E’en now methinks I see him still,
His country banner wave,
On, on and win a deathless fame
my beautiful, my brave. now methinks I see him still,
His country banner wave,
On, on and win a deathless fame
my beautiful, my brave.
On, on and win a deathless fame
my beautiful, my beautiful, my brave.

DUETT [sung after each VERSE]
God of the battle, shield him still,
And yet Thy will be done.
A sister for a brother prays,
A mother for her son.
We seek to share no glory now,
We ask Thee but to save.
The noble hearts of Dixey,
Our beautiful and brave.
The noble hearts of Dixie,
Our beautiful, our beautiful and brave.

2. [1st Voice]
Mother! I know thy courage well.
Thine is an ancient race.
Yet while thy heart so proudly swells
A tear steals down thy face,
A tear steals down thy face.
But fear not for thy noble boy
still still our banners wave
And Heav’n that watches over all
Will shield thy young and brave.
And Heav’n that watches over all
Will shield, will shield thy young and brave.
[2nd Voice]
Yes, Yes I trust it may be so,
I told not all my dreams,
I saw my gallant boy ride forth,
Where crimson flow’d the stream;
Where crimson flow’d the stream
I hear, I hear the shouts of victory,
Cease, cease thou sounds of joy,
They can not glad a mother’s heart,
Oh! give me back my boy. hear, I hear the shouts of victory,
Cease, cease thou sounds of joy,
They can not glad a mother’s heart,
Oh! give me back my boy.
They can not glad a mother’s heart
Oh! give me back, Oh! give me back my boy.
