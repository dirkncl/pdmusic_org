My country, ’tis of thee
Sweet Land of liberty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrim’s pride,
From ev’ry mountin side
Let freedom
Ring thro’ the world with great applause
Ring thro’ the world with great applause,
Let every clime to freedom dear,
Listen with a joyful ear;
While off’ring peace sincere and just,
In heav’n we place a manly trust;
That truth and justice will prevail,
And every scheme of bondage fail.

O say can you see by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming;
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro’ the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming,
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro’ the might that
Our country’s starry flag is here,
The Herald Flag of time,
We meet beneath its glorious folds
In Freedom’s happy clime,
And thousand eyes are turned to it,
Sole guardian of the free,
Who love their country’s honor safe,
On land or stormy sea.

He lay upon his dying bed:
His eye was growing dim,
When with a feeble voice he called
His weeping son to him:
“Weep not, my boy!” the vet’ran said,
“I bow to Heav’ns high will—
But quickly from you antlers bring
The Sword of Bunker Hill;
But quickly from yon antlers bring
The Sword of Bunker Hill.

Yankee doodle guard your coast,
Yankee doodle dandy,
Fear not then nor threat nor boast,
Yankee doodle dandy.

Our ||: Flag is there! Our Flag is there!
We’ll hail it with three loud huzzahs!
Our Flag is there! Our Flag is there!
Behold the glorious Stripes and Stars! [FINE]
Stout hearts have fought for that bright flag,
Strong hands sustain’d it must head high,
And Oh to see how proud it waves
Brings tears of joy in ev’ry eye,
Our :||
