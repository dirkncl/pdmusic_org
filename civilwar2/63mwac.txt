1. The tattoo beats, the lights are gone,
  The camp around in slumber lies;
The night with solemn pace moves on,
  And sad, uneasy thoughts arise.
I think of thee, oh, dearest one!
  Whose love my early life hath blest.
Of thee and him our baby son,
  Who slumbers on thy gentle breast.

2. God of the tender, hover near
  To her whose watchful eye is wet;
The mother, wife— the doubly dear,
  And cheer her drooping spirits yet.
Now while she kneels before Thy Throne,
  Oh, teach her, Ruler of the skies!
No tear is wept to Thee unknown,
  No hair is lost, no sparrow dies.

3. That thou canst stay the ruthless hand
  Of dark disease, and soothe its pain;
That only by Thy stern command
  The battle’s lost, the soldier slain:
By day, by night— in joy or woe—
  By fears oppressed, or hopes beguiled,
From every danger, every foe,
  Oh, God! protect my wife and child!
