ALL QUIET ON THE POTOMAC.

How often have our eyes rested upon those words.
All quiet on the Ptomac. All quiet! Ah! Look into some
of those tents that are scattered up and down as far
as the eye can see, east and west, north and south,
the white tents appear, interspersed with baggage 
wagons, ambulances, and whatever else pertains 
to an enormous army. All is quiet there. Go to 
yonder tent where the Chaplain and physician 
have just entered. See the wild vacant glare of 
that young man's eyes; several of his comrades
are trying to retain him on his bed of straw. Hear
those touching words, Father, Mother, home.
In the delirium of fever he is again in that home
where kind friends surround him. In imagination
he is living over again the scenes round which
memory loves to linger, and while the burning
fever is drying up the fountains of life, he is 
calling with all the strength of insanity upon 
those dear friends, who will never respond 
to his call. Oh! who covets such a quiet as 
that so often witnessed in many of our once
happy homes as the noiseless messenger
along his wiry track brings the sad news of 
a son or brother fallen! Who does not pray 
to the God of nations that a quiet fraught 
with such consequences may speedily
come to an end?


1. All quiet! hark, no cannon’s roar,
Is heard along Potomac’s shore.
The foe hath found a safe retreat,
Our mighty force they wait to meet.
Oh! harken not, our leaders say.
We would pursue a prudent way,
From month to month, from year to year,
All quiet is the sound we hear.

2. May heaven send a Washington,
To lead our halting army on,
To crush at once our rebel foe,
That peace and quet we may know.
May heaven stay this cruel strife,
This awful sacrifice of life,
And grant us peace forevermore,
Without a slave to curse our shore.
