1. 
In freedom’s name our blades we draw,
She arms us for the fight!
For country, goverment and law,
For liberty and right!
The Union must, shall shall be preserved,
Our flag still o’er us fly!
That cause our hearts and hands has served, 
And we will do or die
Then come ye hardy Volunteers,
Around our standard throng
And pledge man’s hopes of coming years,
Our country, right or wrong!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Our country, right or wrong,
Inspires the burden of our song!
It was the glory or our sires,
Our country, right or wrong!

2. 
It is the duty of us all,
To check rebellion’s sway!
To rally at the nation’s call,
And we that voice obey!
We like a band of brothers go,
A hostile league to break!
To rout a spoiltencumber’d foe.
And what is ours retake!
Then come ye hardy Volunteers,
Around our standard throng!
And pledge man’s hope of coming years,
Our country, right or wrong!
