1. Ye loyal Union volunteers,
Your country claims your aid.
Says Uncle Abe a foe appears,
Are we to be afraid?
Are we to be afraid my boys,
No at them we will go,
On Poto mac’s banks we’ll close our ranks,
And march to meet the foe.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We’ll just say who’s afraid my boy,
And at them we will go.
On Potomac’s banks, we’ll close our ranks,
And bravely charge the foe.

2. If despots hate our freedom boys,
And dare invade our land,
They’ll find that we are well prepar’d,
Our rifles in our hand.
They’ll find each bank an outwork boys.
Each bush a living fire,
We’ll burn the grass beneath their feet,
And force them to retire.

3. Now where’s the craven hearted slave,
Who flies  when he should stand,
Why bet him fill a coward’s grave,
Unwept as he’s unman’d,
But we will at our country’s call,
Inscribe our names on high,
Hurrah! we’ll muster one and all,
And bravely do or die.
