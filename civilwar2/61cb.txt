1. Upon a smooth and placid stream 
That laves the “eastern shore,” 
Beneath the sun’s soft golden beam, 
A light bark glided o’er 
Upon her deck, I spied a form. 
’Round which the graces dwell, 
With heart all glowing, pure and warm, 
Sweet, charming Carrie Bell. 
Sweet, charming Carrie Bell. 
Sweet, charming Carrie Bell.

2. A bright array of lovely girls
Gave Beauty to the scene
And one whose golden tintted curls
Eclipsed the day god’s sheen.
Threw sunlight as she moved along
Were e’er her glances fell,
But brightest of all that throng,
Was brighteyed Carrie Bell,.
Was brighteyed Carrie Bell,
Was brighteyed Carrie Bell. 

3.  I’ve gazed on beauty’s face
And beauty’s radiant eye;
On forms as peerless in their grace
As seraphs from the sky.
And brighter maidens, it may be
Upon this green earth dwell,
But none seem half so sweet to me
As brighteyed Carrie Bell,
As brighteyed Carrie Bell,
As brighteyed Carrie Bell. 

4. Fair girl, thou ne’er wilt press the hand
That sweeps this trembling lyre,
To sing thy virtues pure and bland,
In wild poetic fire.
The minstrel’s heart may never know
The magic of thy spell;
Yet still to thee his thoughts will flow,
Sweet brighteyed Carrie Bell,
Sweet brighteyed Carrie Bell,
Sweet brighteyed Carrie Bell.
