1. When challenging trumpets are braying aloud,
And the eye of the soldier looks daring and proud,
And gay plumes are dancing, and helmets are glancing,
While bright arms are gleaming, and banners are streaming,
And shrill fifes are screaming, and drums sternly beat to marching of feet,
Like solemn wind chanting a ponderous song,
To gathering thousands that’s tramping along,
I shout with delight, for I love the grand sight!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Ho! ho! ho! for the battles fierce clamor and strife!
Hurrah! hurrah! 
hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah! for the warriors life!

2. When deathdealing cannons are belching their flame
Long lines of bright musketry sharply acclaim,
While hosts are engaging, and battle is raging,
And freemen are crying, their foemen defying,
Who from them are flying in pallid dismay, like winddriven spray,
And soars the proud eagle aloft while his foe
Lies bleeding and torn on the red plain below,
I shout with delight, for I love the grand sight!
