CHORUS [sung before each SOLO]
Up with the Stripes and Stars,— 
Down with the Stars and Bars— 
Long shall our banner in tri umph now wave— 
Paean of liberty! Glad notes of Jubilee! 
Justice has stricken the Chains from the Slave. 

SOLO
1. Hail to the bright light that breaks o’er the nation—
Hail to the tidings that come from afar—
Treason now quakes to its very foundation—
Cowers in fear before liberty’s war.

SOLO
2. Never again shall the black desolation,
Blight our fair land with its pestilent breath;
Slavery dies! yes, the foul degredation,
Writhes in the throes of a merited death.

SOLO
3. Son of Columbia, thou who hast given,
Hope in the bondmen and heart to the free;
Thou, who the trammels that held thee have risen—
Infinite Honor and Glory to thee.
