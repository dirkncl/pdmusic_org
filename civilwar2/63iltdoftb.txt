Respectfully Dedicated to
Rev. M.P. Gaddis.
"I Loved
That Dear Old Flag
The Best" (1863).
Song and Chorus.

Rev. M. P. Gaddis relates the following touching incident:—
  A young soldier, belonging to one of the Minnesota Reiments, was dying from
wounds received in battle: he requested me to get him the pictures of his mother and
sisted from his knapsack.  After kissing them tenderly, he raised his tear-dimmed
eyes till they rested on a flag at the end of the hospital, when his eyes grew bright
as he exclaimed, "Oh, Chaplain: I loved my dear mother and sister, but I loived
thet dear old FLAG the best."

1. Look within my knapsack,
You will find them there;
Pictures of my mother,
And of sister dear,
Let me once more see them,
Ere my life is past,
Once more let me kiss them,
It will be the last.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I wept when I bade my mother adieu,
My sister was clasped to my breast,
And they know that I loved them fondly and true,
But I loved that dear old Flag the best.

2. Tell them very gently,
When you’ve lain me low,
(should it come too roughly)
They would die, I know,
Tell them that at parting,
I did sigh for them,
Tell them that in Heaven,
We will meet again.

3. Raise me while the twilight
Lingers o’er the plain,
Let me see that old Flag,
Floating once again,
Let me see “its bright stars,”
Gleaming in the sun,
Let me see “its broad Stripes”
Ere the day is done.

4. When in death I’m sleeping,
That old Flag shall wave,
O’re our States United,
And o’er treason’s grave,
Peace and plenty smiling
O’er each happy home,
Bringing naught but gladness
In the days to come.
