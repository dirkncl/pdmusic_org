1. To sing a bully song I’ll try,
  Bully for you, Bully for you,
Gay as they make them here am I
  Bully for you, for you,
You’ll hear these words from ev’ry tongue
  Bully for you, Bully for you,
Little and big and odd and young
  Bully for all, for all,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah for the HERO the theme of our song,
  Bully for all, Bully for all,
Join in the chorus and help it along,
  Bully for all, for all.

2. Secession now is all the talk,
  Bully for you, Bully for you
New York seceded from New York,
  Bully for her, for her,
Tinecum too is going to slide,
  Bully for her, Bully for her,
Guess she’ll go the next high tide
  Bully for her, for her,

3. My Gal seceded ’tother night,
  Bully for her, Bully for her,
She said I did not suit her quite,
  Bully for her, for her.
Says I repent  you must ere long,
  Bully for you, Bully for you,
’Cause I for Union go it strong,
  Bully for you, for you.

4. There’s gallant Major Anderson,
  Bully for him, Bully for him,
His deeds are praised by every one,
  Bully for him, for him.
He played the Charlston folks a game
  Bully for him, Bully for him,
If I’d been there I’d done the same,
  Bully for you, for you.

5. He cross’d the harbor ’neath their guns,
  Bully for him, Bully for him,
And swears he’ll die before he runs,
  Bully for him for him,
On Sumpters Fort with willing hand,
  Bully for him, Bully for him,
Ready to fight he noble stands,
  Bully for him, for him.

6. The Union we are bound to save,
  Bully for us, Bully for us,
Triumphant too, our Flag shall wave,
  Bully for that, for that,
Secession talk must soon play out,
  Bully for that, Bully for that,
Then for our Union let us shout,
  Bully for all, for all.
