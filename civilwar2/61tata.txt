1. 
To arms! to arms! ye Sons of the North!
Rally under the Flag of the Union;
Protect and defend her, for ever she’s worth,
To be held next our free Constitution;
Let us go where the Flag of our Country calls,
Who stands by the Union is a Martyr if he falls!
Let us go where the Flag of our Country calls,
Who stands by the Union is a Martyr if he falls!

2. 
To arms! To arms! unsheathe the sword!
For our glorious Flag is insulted!
Be true to the Union
And strengthen the cord,
Of the Bond that from Freedom resulted.
It was won by our Fathers mid struggles and blood!
Keep the Flag of the Union as a most sacred good!
It was won by our Fathers with struggles and blood!
Keep the Flag of our Union as a most sacred good!

3. 
To arms! to arms! turn backward the tide,
Of the war, that is threat’ning our homes
That born in treason and foster’d by pride,
Points its sword at our Capitols domes
Hark! the Stars and the Stripes speak of glory of yore!
Let us stand by that Banner or breathe never more!
Hark! the Stars and the Stripes speak of glory of yore!
Let us stand by that Banner or breathe never more!
