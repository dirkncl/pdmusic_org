1. Midnight upon the placid bay,
All nature seems at rest;
The silver moonbeams lightly play
Upon the harbor’s breast.
But hark! from yonder ship a sound
Disturbs the silence reigning ’round;
It is the frigate’s midnight bell,
And watch proclaiming
“All’s well! All’s well! All’s well”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
“All’s well!”— The lonely watchman’s cry
Succeeds the stroke of midnight bell;
The ship is safe— no foe is nigh!
The hour is peaceful— “All’s well!”

2. “All’s well!” then rest in peace, brave crew,
In port now safe at last;
The fearful scenes you’ve battled thro’
Are naught, for danger’s past!
The noble ship secure doth ride
Upon the harbor’s mirror’d tide,
Far from old ocean’s restless swell,
Sleep on, brave crew, for
“All’s well! All’s well! All’s well!”

3. “God of our Fathers,” speed the day
When this fierce storm shall cease,
And bring our Ship of State, we pray,
Safe to the Bay of Peace.
Soon may we hear the watchman’s voice
Proclaiming to the world, “Rejoice!”
Wide let the welcome tidings swell—
Freedom, hath triumph’d
“All’s well! All’s well! All’s well!”
