1. Go, forth, my darling to the conflict,”
Thus spoke a mother to her boy,
“Ne’er let me hear you turn’d away,
When traitors threaten our lov’d country to destroy;
Take with you a mother’s blessing,
Keep this bible near your heart.
Never forget a mother’s pray’rs are ever with you,
And her love for you will ne’er depart.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
All’s well, he sleeps, the orange flowers bloom on his grave,
Sadly she weeps for him who died upon the battlefield,
Her own lov’d soldier boy so brave.

2. Go! for your country’s voice is calling,
All stout of heart and strong of hand,
How could you nobler die, than fighting bravely
For your God and honor’d native land?
And if this is our last parting,
If death breaks the loving spell,
Trust in Him who watcheth e’en the sparrow when is falleth,
All is well, “He doeth all things well.”

3. Foremost among the ranks in battle,
Stood forth the patriot mother’s joy,
Clear o’er the din of muskets rattle,
Rung the cheering words of that brave soldier boy;
Eyes lit up with strangest beauty,
Soul that knew no danger near,
Firmly he stood amid the harvest death was reaping,
With a heart that knew no trembling fear.

4. But soon the fatal ball come swiftly,
Slowly he sank upon the sod,
Faintly he whisper’d, “Dearest mother,
Comrades I shall soon be o’er beyond the flood;
Take from out my vest my bible,
Place the treasure in my hand.”
One loving look, one gentle quiver,
And his spirit took in flight,
Home to the heavenly land.
