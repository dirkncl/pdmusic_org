"Aura Lea" (1861)
Words by W. W. Fosdick, Esq.
Music by George R. Poulton

1.
When the Blackbird in the Spring,
On the willow tree
Sat and rock'd, I heard his sing,
Singing Aura Lea, Aura Lea,
Maid of golden hair;
Sunshine came along with thee,
And swallows in the air.

CHORUS 2 times -- 'f' and 'p'
Aura Lea (Aura Lea)
Maid of golden hair; (of golden hair;)
Sunshine came along with thee,
And swallows in the air.

2.
In thy blush the rose was born,
  Music, when you spake,
Through thine azure eye of morn,
  Sparkling, seemed to break.
Aura Lea, Aura Lea,
  Birds of crimson wing
Never song have sung to me
  As in that sweet spring.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Aura Lea! the bird may flee,
  The willow's golden hair
Swing through winter fitfully,
  On the stormy air.
Yet if thy blue eyes I see,
  Gloom will soon depart;
For to see, sweet Aura Lea
  Is sunshine through the heart.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
When the mistletoe was green,
  Midst the winter's snows,
Sunshine in thy face was seen,
  Kissing lips of rose.
Aura Lea, Aura Lea,
  Take my golden ring;
Love and light return to thee,
  And swallows with the spring.

(CHORUS 2 times)
