1. Oh! Dixie’s Land’s a Nation now,
Her sons no longer slaves, I trow,
Then fill brave boys,
A bumper fill for Dixie!
Her scarr’d and maim’d, her jewels are,
Their praises echo near and far,
Thro’ all the land;
Then battle on for Dixie!

[Refrain and CHORUS, sung after each VERSE]
Then stand and stike for Dixie!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Her banner floating o’er us,
Our hearts are one for Dixie!
Then shout, then shout.
The battle cry of Dixie!
Then shout, oh shout!
The battle cry of Dixie!

2. Around the borders of our land,
Behold a brave and fearless band,
The tried and true,
The faithful guard of Dixie!
They care no for the leaden rain,
Nor shrink from trial, toil, and pain,
So they in time,
May free their cherish’d Dixie!

3. A few more blows, brave boys, and fate,
With kindly hand, the peaceful gate
Will open wide,
That leads us home to Dixie!
There mothers, wives, and sweethearts stand,
And long to greet with open hand,
And words of love,
The living shields of Dixie!

4. What tho’, thro’ bitter cold, and sleet,
We’ve struggled on with weary feet,
We heed it not,
There’s rest for us in Dixie!
What tho’ we mourn our comrades slain,
Who sleep on many a battle plain,
They cannon die.
Their name’s are shrin’d in Dixie!

5. A light is beaming thro’ the cloud,
That hid within its lurid shroud,
In doubt and gloom,
The rising star of Dixie!
The shadow soon shall pass away,
And Freedom’s pure and perfect day
Shall shine at last,
Shall shine for us in Dixie!
