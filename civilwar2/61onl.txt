1. Our Native Land— Our Native Land—
Land dear to ev’ry heart!
They breathe free air, they proudly stand,
Who but of thee have part!
’Tis not broad plains, or skies so clear,
Or mountains high and grand.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
’Tis Liberty that makes so dear
Our own blest Native Land!

2. Dear Native Land! the world’s oppress’d
Torn longingly to thee;
Not for thy wealth, thy might confess’d,
Thy noble Unity,
Not for thy wide, embracing sphere,
Thy sons that waiting stand.

3. O Land belov’d— whose Washington
Toil’d nobly for its peace,
Whose patriots bled till life was done,
That tyrany might cease!
’Twas Freedom’s shrine they sought to rear;
By that we ever stand.

4. Dear Native Land— Dear Native Land,
May peace withing thee dwell!
May boun=teous life from God’s good hand,
O’er all they valleys swell!
May Right and Truth have naught to fear
While heav’n and earth shall stand!
