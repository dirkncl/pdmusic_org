1. Beneath the shad the flow’rs were sleeping.
The weary breeze in silence creep ing.
The silver dews Their lamps were keeping.
In shelter’d nook or flow’rets breast,
I heard the scream then onward straying,
Its ripples break in waters playing;
While mem’ry sang with years decaying,
I’ll ne’er forget, I’ll ne’er forget
this vale of rest, sweet vale of rest,
sweet vale of rest.

2. I’ve wandered far, all changes viewing,
One dream of joy in vain pursuing
While visions bright I’ve left in ruins;
The gilded barques that deck life’s breast.
Yet one soft voice again is singing,
The wings of Hope fresh odors bringing.
While mem’ry back thro’ tears is springing
To dream of youth, to dream of youth’s
sweet vale of rest, sweet vale of rest,
sweet vale of rest.
