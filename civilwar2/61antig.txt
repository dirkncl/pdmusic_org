[sung as VERSE and QUARTETTE]
1. To the Majesty on high,
Ruling oceans, earth, and sky,
Lo! the nation lifts its eye:
God we trust in Thee;
Thou art judge supreme alone,
Justice gems thy glorious throne,
Make Columbia’s cause thine own—
God we trust in Thee!

[sung as VERSE and QUARTETTE]
2. Shield the patriotic band,
Who with willing heart and hand,
Fly to save their native land—
God we trust in Thee!
Thou from discord, peace can bring;
And our heart’s deep sorrowing
Change to joy’s exultant spring:
God we trust in Thee.

4. When sweet Freedom’s banner bright,
Floats in morning’s dappled light,
Or the starry eyes of night,
Then our soungs shall be:
Glory to the King above,
Who in mercy, changeless love,
Bade our land His wisdom prove—
God all praise to Thee!
