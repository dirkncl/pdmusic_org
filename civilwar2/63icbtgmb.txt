1. I cannot bid thee go, my boy,
  I dare not bid thee stay;
My fainting heart would keep thee here,
  But duty points the way
To where our nations son’s array’d,
  Against the trait’rous foe,
Need loyal hearts and hands,
  And yet, I cannot, cannot bid thee go!

2. Oh! why are women’s hearts so weak,
  In this, our Country’s need?
Why stand we back with wistful eyes
  And tearful, to impede
The patriotic zeal of those
  Who for their Country dare
Their all to sacrifice,
  While we yield blindly, blindly to despair!

3. Our task should be to cheer them on
  In duty’s rugged road;
In humble faith to pray for them,
  And ask the care of God;
On husbandsa, fathers, brothers, sons
  Who nobly in the fight,
Beneath their own lov’d Starry Flag
  Are battling for the right!

4. I dare not bid thee stay, my boy,
  And yet my falt’ring voice,
Refuses still to speak the words
  To make thy heart rejoice.
Then let thy conscience act her part,
  And mark thy mother’s word:—
Far better fill a patriot’s grave
  Than wield a traitor’s sword!
