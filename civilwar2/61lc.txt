1. Freemen rouse in strength divine
  And shout for Abe and Andy,
Bright the stars of freedom shine,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!
In serried rank, triumphant host,
  Freemen onward to your post,
Let proud Columbia be your boast,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!

CHORUS 1-6.
Strike for all enshrining time,
Strike for Union, grand, sublime,
Strike and wake the centuries’ chime,
Hurrah for Abe and Andy!

2. Come for glorious, grand old sires,
  And shout for Abe and Andy,
Come for altars and your fires,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!
Strike for all enshrining time,
  Strike for union gramd sublime,
Strike and wake the centuries’ chime,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!

3. Patrots rise— the westtern world
  Declares for Abe and Andy,
High your banner be unfurl’d,
  Blazon’d for Abe and Andy.
Bear aloft in glorious pride,
  Wave around creation wide,
Freedom, progress, watchword, guide,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!

4. Hear that vast triumphant souind,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy,
How it vibrates for around,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy.
Like diapason of the sea,
  Great swelling anthem of the free
A nation’s glorious minstrelsy,
  For Abe, old Abe and Andy!

5. ’Tis the hour of soverign fate
  That calls for Abe and Andy,
To save the proud imperiled state,
  Stand by Abe and Andy.
Patriots heed your country’s voice,
  Make freedom’s champions now your choice,
And coming ages will rejoice,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy!

6. Love shall here her altars build,
  Hurrah for Abe and Andy,
Sublimeest art proud strutures gild
  In praise of Abe and Andy.
Order and law triumphant reign,
  No binding yoke, no galling chain,
Return the golden age again,
  And blest be Abe and Andy!
