1. Ole massa, on he trabbels,  gone; 
He leab the land behind; 
De Lord’s breff blow him furder on, 
Like cornshucks in de wind. 
We own de hoe, we own  de plough; 
We own de hands dat hold, 
We sell de pig, we sell de cow; 
But nebber chile be sold.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
De yam will grow, de cotton blow, 
We’ll had de rice an corn, 
So nebber you fear, if nebber you hear, 
De driver, blow his horn.

2. We pray de Lord; he gib us  signs, 
Dat some day we be free. 
De Norf wind tell it to the pines; 
De wild duck to de sea. 
We tink it, when de churchbell ring; 
We dream it in de dream, 
De ricebird, mean it when he sing, 
De eagle when he scream.

3. We know de promise nebber fail, 
An nebber lie, de word. 
So like de ’postles in de jail, 
We waited for de Lord. 
And now, he open eb’ry door, 
And trow away de key, 
He tink we lub him, so before; 
We lub him better free.
