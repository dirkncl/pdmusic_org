1. Here’s a toast there’s a toast to the Happy New Year 
And a parting salute to the Old. 
May it bring in its train every blessing and cheer. 
And line all our purses with gold. 
May the dear ones we cherish prove constant and true. 
And loving hearts never grow cold. 
May every bright blessing arrive with the New. 
Every grief pass away with the Old.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Here’s a toast (Here's a toast), 
  here’s a toast (here's a toast) to the Happy New Year. 
And a parting salute to the Old. 
May it bring (May it bring) 
  in its train (in its train), every blessing and cheer 
And line all our purses with gold.

2. May the vulture called War,  fly away with the Old 
Bearing off every scourge in its train. 
May the sweet dove of Peace her bright pinions fold, 
And smile on our Counttry again. 
May the States disunited by faction and feud, 
Which bitter contentions did sever, 
Turn back from those scenes full of carnage and blood, 
And prove true to the Union forever!

3. Here’s a toast to the gallant young heroes that’re slain 
In defence of their National right. 
Their brave deeds of valor will not prove in vain. 
But serve as a bright beacon light. 
And here’s to the sorrowing hearts left at home, 
Are conflicted by hopes and by fears, 
O soon the war over, their lov’d ones may come, 
And in peace pass each Hap py New Year.
