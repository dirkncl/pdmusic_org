1. The Yankees are mighty quare boys,
  In fun they’re not left much behind
While in farseeing tho¦ they rejoice,
  Just now they seem plazed to be blind.
If things don’t entirely agree,
  With their private view by the way,
Tho’ the matter is proved so to be
  ”I don’t see it” they silly say.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Now don’t it seem aizy to do
Just be after trying it on
The next time you’ve bothered a few
Say “I don’t see it” faith and its gone.

2. A Zouave the tother day strayed,
  In to Washington city so free,
When a Colonel just off parade
  Rode up in his brave finery
Here hold my horse fellow he cried.
  And seemed in a hurry to be
But the Zou Zou just looked to one side
  “I don’t see it” Colonel said he.

3. The Seceshers thought we were bent,
  On having with John Bull, a fight,
Because we made free with the “Trent”—
  They hugged themselves up with delight,
They all felt so sure we had tried,
  A move that we couldn’t repair;
When we let the commissioners slide,
  “They don’t see it” now they declare.

4. The rebels all thought they would fix,
  The goverment just their own way,
But tho’ they’re so cute at their tricks:
  They hav’n’t yet gained the day,
Our cities they boast they’ll live in;
  And have their own way with us still:
But if they think that we will give in,
  “We don’t see it” and never will.
