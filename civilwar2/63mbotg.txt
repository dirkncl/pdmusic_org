1. March bravely on to glory, ye liberators,
God and our country ever by your cry:
Scorn and defiance hurling to the traitors,
Who our proud Union banner would destroy.
Arouse! to arms! to arms! the rebels meeting
That would their mother country’s flag disgrave;
With patriot hearts the bloody conflict greeting,
Against their serried cohorts face to face,
  With patriot hearts the bloody conflict greeting,
  Against their serried cohorts face to face.


2. No foreign foemen now in fight assail thee,
Bright spangled banner of the free and brave;
And shall our children ever here bewail thee
With patriot soldiers in one common grave?
Then rush to arms! our fatherland is bleeding,
Stabb’d by the parricides unholly streel;
Its recreant sons, no filial duty heeding,
The vindicated law shall justly feel;
  Its recreant sons, no filial duty heeding,
  The vindicated law shall justly feel.

3. America thy glorious flag of Union,
Shall proudly wave in ev’ry state and clime,
Not one terrestrial star of thy communion
Shall ever be eras’d to end of time.
The God of battles surely will protect it.
Emblem divine it is of liberty;
In ev’ry sister state we will erect it,
The Union banner of the brave and free;
  In ev’ry sister state we will erect it,
  The Union banner of the brave and free.
