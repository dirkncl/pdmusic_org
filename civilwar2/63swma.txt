1.
Ever since from me you parted,
For the battle plain;
I have thought, near broken hearted,
Shall we meet again?
In my dreams the cannons rattle,
Flashes light the sky
And I see in ev'ry battle,
Banner floating high.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Morning, noon and evening,
As I pine in vain,
Ever is my spirit breathing,
Shall we meet again?

2.
When the evening is revealing,
Stars of golden light;
Or, the rays of morn come stealing,
From the passing night;
Even then I knew no gladness,
And I mourn in vain,
For my heart doth ask in sadness,
Shall we meet again?

3.
To the clouds above me flying,
Or the deep blue sky;
To each object round me lying,
Breathe I forth my sigh.
On my ear no answer falleth,
While I thus complain;
And in vain my spirit calleth,
Shall we meet again?
