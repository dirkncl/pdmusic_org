1. The Southern blood is running fast 
Through Southern veins tonight. 
Our patriots boys on tented fields, 
Are eager for the fight. 
On many a hill and many a plain 
Rifle, Sabre, knife, 
In bright array flash night and day 
For mother, sister, wife.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Hurrah for our Southern boys, 
The Ladies should adore them, 
Our flag above them flies 
And Heaven is watching o’er them, 
Hurrah hurrah hurrah. 

CHORUS (ad libitum) [sung after each REFRAIN]
Hurrah for our Southern boys, 
The Ladies should adore them. 
Our flag above them flies, 
And Heaven is watching o’er them, 
Hurrah, Hurrah Hurrah. 

2. Yet, though our boys are gone to war, 
And left the dear ones here, 
They need not heave a single sigh, 
Nor shed a single tear, 
For gamesome hearts and opon hands, 
each soldier left behind him, 
So let him fight with all  his might, 
Our hearts know where to find him. 

3. Oh! near to us, and dear to us,  
Is ev’ry darling treasure 
That round the soldiers fireside 
Tills home with love and pleasure, 
And while the patriots absent be, 
let’s stand by our Committee, 
And keep our market full and free! 
Pride of the Crescent City.
