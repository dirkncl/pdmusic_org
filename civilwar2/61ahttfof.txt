[N.B. When the March is played without the Vocal part,
the Trio only should be repeated.]

1.
 All Hail to the Flag of Freedom!
The Pride of our Glorious Land,
 Beneath its broad Stripes United,
Unconquer'd forever we'll stand.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Shout Huzza! for the Flag,
For the Flag of Free and Brave;
Long may it wave o'er land and sea,
Emblem of Right and Liberty,
 Shout Huzza! for the Flag,
 For the Flag of Free and Brave;
 Long may it wave o'er land and sea,
 Emblem of Right and Liberty,

2.
 Rise Freemen, our Flag upholding,
With valor determin'd and strong;
 Its bright Constellation unfolding,
Where Liberty battles with Wrong.

3.
 Those Stars and those Stripes, shall ever
Triumphantly wave o'er the foe;
 And he who their Union would sever,
The doom of the traitor shall know!
