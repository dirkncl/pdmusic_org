1. I've no money so you see,
Peter never thinks of me,
Peter never thinkgs of me,
I own it to my sorrow.
Oh could I grow rich, and he
Be reduced, to poverty.
What sweet revenge twould be for me,
To marry him,
To marry him, 
To marry him, tomorrow,
To marry him,
To marry him, tomorrow.

2. Peters thought almost a fool,
You have profited by school,
Peters thought almost a fool,
Wit from you folks borrow.
Peters plain you handsome gay,
But if you were both to say,
Will you have my Gertrude pray,
I'd marry him,
I'd marry him,
I'd marry him, tomorrow,
I'd marry him,
I'd marry him,
I'd marry him, tomorrow.
