1. Sit by the summer Sea
Thou whom scorn wasteth
And let thy musing be
Where the flood hasteth
Mark how o’er Ovean’s breast,
Rolls the hour billows crest!
Such deem his thoughts unrest
Who of love tasteth,
Who of love tasteth,
Who of love tasteth,
Ah-ah.

2. Greiv’st thou that hearts should change?
Lo! where life reigneth
Or the free night may range,
What long remaineth?
Spring with her flow’rs shall die;
Fast fades the gilded sky,
And the pale moon on high,
Ceaseless ly wa neth,
Cease lessly waneth,
Ceaselessly waneth.
Ah-ah.

3. Smile then oh greatly wise,
And if love sever
Bonds which the soul doth prize,
Such was it ever.
Deep as the rolling seas,
Soft as the twilight breeze,
But of more truth than these,
Boast could it never,
Boast could it never,
Boast could it never.
Ah-ah.
