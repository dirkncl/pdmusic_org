1. Flow on flow on thou bright young Banner
Adopted by the free
When at the cannons mouth they swore
For Death or Liberty
 For Death or Liberty.
Thou child of peril the stripes that date
Thy yet unwritten story,
May gather stars and wave o'er fields,
Where Freemen fight for Glory,
  Where Freemen fight for Glory.

2. The breeze of heaven shall bear thee,
Upon its sunny wing,
Until the triumph of thy star,
The dove of peace shall bring
 The dove of peace shall bring.
Thy birth place was the field of blood,
And wars terific thunder,
Did cradle thee till thou hast broke,
The oppressors bonds assunder
  The oppressors bonds assunder.

3. Among the flags of nations,
There is a place for thee,
Flaunt up thou bright young banner,
Flaunt proudly o'er the free
  Flaunt proudly o'er the free.
The stripes, and stars shall lead thee on,
That o'er Columbia were,
Float on in sweet companionship,
Proud banner of the brave
  Proud banner of the brave.
