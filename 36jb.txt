1. 
I am de sassy niggar, As dey call me Jim Brown. 
I plays upon de Bonjo all about de town, 
I hate de common niggar, I no shake dem by de ham, 
O shaw, I am de leader ob de famus niggar ban, 
	I plays upon de fife, an I plays upon de drum, 
	I am de bes musian dat now or eber swum. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Lalle doodle, lalle doodle, lalle doodle laddle la, 
Lalle doodle, lalle doodle, lalle doodle daddle da.

2.
De way I comes to play de Fife an carry ob de Sword,
I practice on de Bonjo wid sugar in de guord;
De niggar’s dey all dance, wen I begin to play,
Dey dance from de mornin till de close ob day.
	I play upon de Bonjo, where ebber I do go,
	And when I kiss de lubly gals, I smack jis so.

3.
De gals in de city dey all run after me,
Because I am so hansome de like dey neber dee;
Dey coax me to choose one ob dem, but I dont know who shall be,
Dey are such lubly creters, am dey all lubs me.
	I play upon de Harp, an den dey sing so sweet,
	O shaw, it does my heart good, wen eber we do meet.

4.
I was born on Long Island dar close to Oyster Bay.
I work upon de farm dar for two shillings a day;
But my genus dat too great, for Massa to diskiver,
So I jump on board de Steam Boat as she cum down de riber.
	I plays upon de Gong, de tune dey call Jim Crow,
	De way I raise de steam on board was no ways show.

5.
I dem lan in great style, de first at Astor house,
I ax dem to serve up well cook’d, a fine roast mouse;
I gobbled dat all down, an den I call for drink,
Dey gib me den so much ob dat, my eyes begun to blink.
	I plays upon de Lyre, and dey begin to sing,
	O shaw, dey dont know music, or any such a ting.

6.
I den goes to de play house de opperer to see,
To critecise on Mr Wood, for knows me;
He’s bery good in some tings, but cant wid me compare,
For instance in Bravurers, I make de hole house stare.
	I plays upon de Fiddle, an dey all cry sing, Jim Brown.

7.
I den goes to de Mayor, I ax fa a commision,
To lead de famus Brass Ban I show him my petition;
He say he tink me first rate, he beg me take a seat,
Wid all de Corporation, I dar set down to eat.
	I plays upon de Trombone, to see what dey would say.
	Our Alderman he bawls out, Jim Brown sound your A.

8.
Since Music in dis city, now be all de rage,
I'll teach de skientific an sing upon de stage;
O den I’ll hab de encores, from all de lubly sex,
As wen I’choose one for my wife, O, de rest ob dem be vex.
	I plays on de Piano, I teach dem  so gay.
	O shaw, I lub de charmin gals, my time ob day.
