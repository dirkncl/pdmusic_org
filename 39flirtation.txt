1. You all have heard how Mister Charles left Jane for Fanny Grey,
And tho' we think it very odd it happens ev'ry day.
A Lady flirt is bad enough, but oh! there's something yet
Is worse you'll say-- I'll tell you what-- It is a male coquet.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
La, la,
la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.

2. Now Jane was not the girl hne thought-- her turn was yet to come
"When Mr. Charles Tod calls again-- Just say I'n not at home"
Next day came out-- eloped they say ('twas in the morning Post)
The heiress and coquette miss G_ with Colonel Glassop Coste.

3. Says Charles Tod-- "that's rather odd-- but I'll go back to Jane"
"Poor foolish girl-- she loves me still-- and I can soon explain"
"I have the tact-- I'll vow to her-- I never meant to roam"
The door was open'd-- "Sir" said John "Miss Fearier's not at home."

4 Now by Great Western came a youth whom Jane had sight forged
He wood in haste-- she gave her hand-- and soon they tied the knot
A not to Charles said "half past 7"-- he though he'd go at eight
He dress'd with care-- and soon was there-- the Bride said "you're too late"
"The Parson's so particular he did not chose to wait."

5. All bels and beaux a warning take-- pray don't despair my song
And flirt whene'er you match you find-- for flirting in a throng
But if you strive to win a heart don't think it "rather odd"
If one and all-- we hope you'll meet-- the fate of Charley Tod.
