1. We’re marching thro’ a wllderness;
Marching, marching;
We’re marching thro’ a wilderness;
Bese on ev’ry side;
We are but a pilgrim band,
Marching t’ward the promised land,
Ev’ry foe we can withstand
With Jesus for our guide.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
No fears disturb us as we go,
Nor fill us with dismay;
For He is a pillar of fire each night,
A pillar of cloud each day.
No fears disturb us as we go,

2. We’re marching thro’ a wllderness;
Marching, marching;
We’re marching thro’ a wilderness;
In search of Canaan’s land.
Soon we’ll reach that blissful shore,
Pilgrim days will soon be o’rer.
Then, in hea’n, for evermore,
We’ll be an angel band!

3. We’re marching thro’ a wllderness;
Marching, marching;
We’re marching thro’ a wilderness;
Beset on ev’ry side;
But the smitten rock will give
Healing draught that we may live;
He will all our sins forgive,
And ev’ry want provide.

4. We’re marching thro’ a wllderness;
Marching, marching;
We’re marching thro’ a wilderness;
With Christ our beacon light;
He will lead us thro’ the flood;
He will give us daily food;
He weil save us by his blood;
And keep us day and night.
