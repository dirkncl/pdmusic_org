1.
At midnight on my lonely beat,
When shadow wraps the wood and lea,
A vision seems my view to greet
Of one at home who thinks of me;
No roses bloom upon her cheek.
Her form is not a lover's dream,
But o'er that brow so pure and meek,
A thousand holier beauties gleam.

CHORUS
Far away from friends and kindred,
Wheresoe'er his lot may be,
Ev'ry wand'rer feels in darkest hour,
There's one at home who thinks of me.

2.
How softly shines her silver hair,
A patient smile is on her face,
And that mild lustrous light so fair,
Around her sheds a moonlike grace;
She thinks of me so far away --
The soldier in his gallant fight,
And begs that fortune ever may
Protect her boy, and bless the right!

(CHORUS)

3.
Though many leagues lie far between,
This silent incense of her heart
Steals o'er my soul with breath serene,
And we no longer are apart;
So guarding thus my lonely beat
By shadowy wood and haunted lea,
That vision seems my view to greet
Of her at home who thinks of me!

(CHORUS)
