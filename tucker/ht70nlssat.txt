1.
Ah, well do I remember
The hour when first we met;
And by that money fountain,
My footsteps linger yet;
For in its low, soft murmur,
There is a magic tone,
That seems almost to whisper
An echo of my own.

CHORUS (or SOLO) [sung after each verse]
Ah, well do I remember
Your dear hand clasped in mine,--
'Twas them my heart first told me,
"No love so sweet as thine."

2.
A change has since come o'er me,
A cloud is on my brow;
The summer days are over,
And we are parted now;
Yet part we not forever,
I know thou still art mine;
And death alone can sever
This trusting heart from mine.
