To Miss Carrie Lounds (New York)
"We Return No More!" (1878)
Highliand song of Emigration
Composed by Henry Tucker

1.
"We return, we return, we return no more!"
So comes the song to the mountain shore;
From those that are leaving their Highland home,
For a world far over the blue sea's foam!
"We return, we return, we return no more!"
So, breathe sad voices our spirits o're,
Murmuring up from the depths of the heart
When lovely things with their light depart--
We return no more!

REFRAIN
and thro' eave and dell
Mournfully wanders our wild farewell!

2.
"We return, we return, we return no more!"
Is't hard when the days of flow'rs are o'er?
When the passionate soul of the nightbird's lay
Hath died from the Summer sands away?
No, it is not the rose that returns no more,
One soft Spring-breath will its bloom restore!
'Tis not the song that o'erflows the bow'rs
A stream of song thro' the starry hours,
But are -- never more!

(REFRAIN)
