1.
The sun is sinking dearest
Behind the blue hills’ breast.
The wand’ring breeze thou hearest
Enquire for place of rest.
The list’ning trees above thee,
Whose brows are wreath’d in green,
Shall hear me say I love thee,
My own bright forest queen.
Shall hear me say I love thee,
My own bright forest queen.

2.
Away to the laughing wild wood,
Far, far in its deep green shade,
The joyous hopes of childhood,
Will never never fade;
Away from haunts of folly,
Cold hearts and anguish keen,
Away from melancholy
We’ll fly my forest queen.

3.
We’ll live and love together,
We’ll brave the cold world’s scorn,
Nor heed life’s stormy weather,
But brisk as the early morn,
We’ll roam the wilds contented,
Nor seek for change of scene,
Our path with hope is scented,
My own bright forest queen.
