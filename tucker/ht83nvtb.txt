To Mrs. Lydia S. Morris, Reading, Kansas.
"No Vow to Bind" (10 Nov 1883)
from "Bud and Flowers.
A Choice Collection of Vocal Gems."
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
I ask no vow to bind the love
Thy heart would now bestow,
Our witness be the stars above,
The flow'rs that bloom below,
Our witness be the the stars above,
The flow'rs that bloom below;
Oh, words were weak and idly vain,
To hold thee fond and dear,
Then breathe no vow to bind us twain,
To doubt is but to fear.

[CHORUS]
I ask no vow to bind the love
Thy heart would not bestow,
Our witness be the stars above,
The flow'rs that bloom below.

2.
I ask no vow to bind thy heart
With gentle clasp to mine,
I only know that where thou art,
My star of hope must shine,
I only know that where thou art,
My star of hope must shine;
Oh, I would have thy love unbought,
Unfettered, bright and true,
As claims the blushing rose unsought,
Its love, the pearly dew.

(CHORUS)
