1.
Sweetest love I'll not forget thee,
Time shall only teach my heart
Warmer fonder to regret thee,
Loving gentle as thou art.

[REFRAIN]
Farewell farewell
Farewell dearest fare thee well,
Sweetest love I'll not forget thee
Loving gentle as thou art.

2.
Still I feel my heart is breaking
When I think I stray from thee
Round the world, that quiet seeking,
Which I fear is not for me.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Oh the pain within, my bosom
Can it, dearest, must it be?
Thou but for an hour will miss himm
He for ever loses thee.

(REFRAIN)
