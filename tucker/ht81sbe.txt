"Soft Brown Eyes" (3 April 1881)
Song
by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
I know two eyes, two soft brown eyes,
Two eyes as sweet and dear
As ever danced in glad surprise,
Or melted with a tear,
In whose fair rays a heart may bask,
Those shadowed rays serene,
But, little maid, you may not ask
Whose gentle eyes I mean,
  But, little maid, you may not ask
  Whose gentle eyes I mean.

2.
I know a voice of fairy tone,
Like brooklet in the June,
That sings to please itself alone,
A little "old-world" tune,
Whose music haunts the list'ner's ear,
And will not leave it free,
But I must never tell you, dear,
Whose accents they may be, 
  But I must never tell you, dear,
  Whose tender accents thy may be.

3.
I know a golden hearted maid
For whom I built a shrine,
A leafy nook of murmurous shade,
Deep in this heart of mine,
And in that cool and calm retreat,
To make her home she came,
Now would you know this secret mine?
The maiden's name is thine!
  Now would you know this secret mine?
  Alas! the maiden's name is thine.
