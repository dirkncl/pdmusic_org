1.
You may talk of your beauties with eyes so bewitching,
Of forms that are faultless and cheeks that like the rose.
You may speak of sly glances that keep one's heart twitching,
It is all very well as far as it goes.
You may tell me of voices of that sound like the ringing
Of "Silvery Bells" just as much as you please,
But yet I am sure none could be half as winning
As my little darling, my "Emma Louise."

CHORUS
My Emma Louise, my own little darling,
There is none to compare with my Emma Louise.

2.
Though others may boast of their beautiful faces,
Such delicate hands and small fairy like feet,
Just compare them to any or all of the graces,
But none with my darling can ever compete,
Though Venus, they say, was in all things perfection,
It all may be true yet I ne'er will believe,
That even the angels, upon close inspection,
Could be half so sweet as my Emma Louise.

(CHORUS)
