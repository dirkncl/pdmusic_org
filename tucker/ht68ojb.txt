1.
Oh, listen now, and I'll sing a song,
  I've got a subject mighty strong;
Its 'bout a man who is known to fame,
  And "Old John Bourbon" is his name.

CHORUS
Old John Bourbon, _hic!_
Old John Bourbon, _hic!_
Such a jolly fellow, oh [as], you never did see
The very man you'd like to meet
Upon a jamboree.

2.
His face is tann'd wid de summer sun,
  And in him dere is heaps of fun;
Dey found him once in a field of corn--
  In old Kaintucky he was born.

(CHORUS)

3.
He puts de lightning down in de toes,
  He plants de blossom on de nose,
And if you flourish a bran-new hat
  Why old John Bourbon 'll knock you flat.

(CHORUS)

4.
Dere's heaps ob troubles dat he will do,
  So dis advice I'll gib to you--
Don't take a bottle wid you to bed,
  Or Old John Bourbon 'll bust your head.

(CHORUS)
