"It's All Up in Dixie" (1863)
Written and Composed by Henry Tucker

1.
This cruel war is almost done,
    Poor old Jeff,
The game you've lost and Abe has won,
    Poor old Jeff,
You'd better just throw up the thing,
  And take what's call'd "leg bail,"
For if you're caught you're bound to "Swing,"
    Poor old Jeff.

CHORUS
"It's all up" in Dixie!
"It's all up" in Dixie!
"The jig is up" in Dixie's Land;
LET UNION STAND FOREVER!!

2.
You thought, in Broadway, grass would grow,
    Poor old Jeff,
I think you find it is "No go,"
    Poor old Jeff,
When sugar grows on cherry trees,
  And rivers turn to rum,
The grass may grow where-e'er you please,
    Poor old Jeff.

(CHORUS)

3.
You've often boasted how you'd fight,
    Poor old Jeff,
But that "last ditch" don't turn out right,
    Poor old Jeff,
You'll find in fighting for the rag,
  You once so proudly flew,
"Hold fast a better dog than Bragg,"
    Poor old Jeff.

(CHORUS)

4.
Four precious Knaves are in each pack,
    Poor old Jeff,
You've had some four score at your back,
    Poor old Jeff,
But knaves don't always win the same;
  You'll find out to your cost
Old Uncle Sam holds "High, Low, Game,"
    Poor old Jeff.

(CHORUS)

5.
Your boys have sometimes nobly fought,
    Poor old Jeff,
When bread and beef you stole or bought,
    Poor old Jeff,
But brave or not, your hungry band,
  Will learn I fear, too late,
That RIGHT with MIGHT must rule this land,
    Poor old Jeff.

(CHORUS)
