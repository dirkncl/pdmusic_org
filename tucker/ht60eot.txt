1.
Ever of thee I'm fondly dreaming,
Thy gentle voice my spirit can cheer;
Thou wert the star that mildly beaming,
Shone o'er my path when all was dark and drear.

Still in my heart thy form I cherish
Ev'ry kind thought like a bird flies to thee;

[CHORUS]
Ah! never till life and mem'ry perish,
Can I forget how dear thou art to me;
Morn, noon and night, where e'er I may be,
Fondly I'm dreaming ever of thee;
Fondly I'm dreaming ever of thee.

2.
Ever of thee when sad and lonely,
Wand'ring afar my soul joy'd to dwell;
Ah! then I felt I lov'd thee only;
All seem'd to fade before affection's spell.

Years have not chill'd the love I cherish,
True as the stars, hath my heart been to thee;

(CHORUS)
