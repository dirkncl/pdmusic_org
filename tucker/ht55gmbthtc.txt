1.
Give me but thy heart tho’ cold.  
I ask  no more. 
Give to others gems and gold, 
But leave me, leave me poor. 
Give to whom thou wilt thy smiles. 
Cast o’er others all thy wiles. 
But let thy tears flow fast and free for me, 
Flow fast and free for me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Give to whom thou wilt thy smiles.
Cast o’er others all thy wiles.
But let thy tears flow fast and free for me,
Flow fast and free for me.

2.
Giv’st  thou but one look sweet heart 
One word no more. 
It is music’s sweetest part 
When lips, when lips run o’er. 
’Tis a part I fain would learn 
So pr’y thee here thy lessons turn 
And teach me to the close 
All love’s pleasure all  its woes.
