1.
Come to me, dearest, I'm lonely without thee,
Day-time and night-time, I'm thinking about thee,
Night-time and day-time, in dreams I behold thee,
Sad is my waking, which ceases to fold thee,
Come, to me, darling, my sorrows to lighten.
Come in thy beauty to bless and and to brighten.
Come in thy womanhood meekly and lowly,
Come in thy lovingness queenly and holy.

2.
Come to me dear, ere I die of my sorrow,
Rise on my gloom like the sun of tomorrow,
Strong, swift, and fond as the words I speak, love,
Song at your lip, and the smile on your cheek love,
Come, for my heart, in your absence is weary,
Haste for my heart, it is sicken'd and dreary.
Come to the arms which alone should caress thee.
Come to the heart, which is throbbing to press thee.
