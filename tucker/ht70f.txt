"Sunshine on the Sea" (1870)
Ballad by Henry Tucker

1.
There are blossoms on the cherry,
There are blossoms on the pear,
And my heart is light and merry, merry,
With the hopes that bloom there;
For the sorrow and the weeping,
Wintry blasts have brought to me,
In the past are calmly sleeping,
Now there's sunlight on the sea.
I am waiting for my lover,
Who is true as truth to me.
Now the wintry storms are over, over,
And there's sunshine on the sea,
Now the wintry storms are over, over,
And there's sunshine on the sea.


2.
"When the bloom of pear or cherry
Is white upon the tree,
When you see the bud and berry,
Then look out, my love, for me."
So he said when last we parted,
While my tears rained on the deck,
For I felt half broken hearted,
In my dread of storm and wreck.
Now each springtide bud and blossom
Brings my own love nearer me,
And the sunshine in my bossom
Is the sunshine on the sea,
And the sunshine in my bossom
Is the sunshine on the sea.
