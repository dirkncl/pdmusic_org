1. From the tomb in brightness and in glory
Christ, our Saviour, comes today,
Seraphs chant the happy, happy story,
All along the heavenly way.

SEMI-CHORUS [with overlapping voices]
[SA]
In glad anthems sweetly swelling,
All the joyful story telling,
[* Ad lib. SOPRANO or TENOR SOLO 
sung with each SEMI-CHORUS]
Glory be to God on high.
[* The Solo may be ommitted, if desired. To make it more
effective, place a portion of the school or some adult
voices in another room to sing the Solo always in unison.]

FULL CHORUS
In the choir of angel voices,
All the heavenly host rejoices,

[sung after each FULL CHORUS]
Glory be to God on high;
Christ the Lord, is risen today,
Christ the Lord, is risen today, is risen today.

2. Lo! He comes, proclaim the news of gladness,
He, a sacrifice for all:
Man no more may tread the vale of sadness,
We are ransomed from the fall.

SEMI-CHORUS
See the work of love redeeming,
’Neath a crown of glory beaming;

FULL CHORUS
Wreaths of light, in glory shining,
On His brow of love are twining,

3. From His throne within the heavenly portals,
Comes the Father’s voice to earth—
“Welcome, Son, from the abode of mortals.
Come where holiness has birth!”

SEMI-CHORUS
Hear the happy voices singing,
Hear the holy poeans singing;

FULL CHORUS
From the grave, and soul’s dark prison,
Christ, our Priest and Lord is risen,
