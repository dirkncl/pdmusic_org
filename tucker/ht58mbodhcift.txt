1.
Darling how can I forget thee!
  How lose the mem'ry sweet,
Of the hour when last I met thee,
  And laid my true heart at thy feet;
There we plighted vows so truly,
  There in sorrow wild did part:
"Mem'ry bells" are ever ringing
  Those mournful changed o'er my heart.

CHORUS
Murm'ring sweetly, cheerily,
And the tale their music tells while ringing,
Bids me hope for days of you love,
Those gently murm'ring mem'ry bells,
Sweet mem'ry bells.

2.
Soon the spring in joy returning
  Will bring sweet birds and flowers;
While my heart in sadness yearning,
  Must ever mourn those happy hours.
Gently sigh the summer breezes,
  Loudly roars the wint'ry blast,
Changing seasons only bring me
  Those dreams too beautiful to last.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the silent stars are weeping
  I gaze in grief and pain,
As the lonely watch I'm keeping:
  Ah! shall we ever meet again!
Cheering souls with sorrow laden,
  "Mem'ry Bells!" Oh, ne'er depart,
But with pictures of those "by-gones"
  Bring hope! to glad the weary-heart.

(CHORUS)
