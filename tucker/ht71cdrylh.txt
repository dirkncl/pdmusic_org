1.
Come, darling, rest your little head
Upon the pillow white,
And give mamma a loving kiss,
Before you say "good-night."
You know what papa said to you
The day he left us here,
And how he press'd the rosy lips
Of you, his precious dear. 

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Come, darling, rest your little head
Upon the pillow white,
And give mamma a parting kiss
Before you say "good-night."

2.
I cannot rest at ease, mamma,
Nor can I go to sleep,
For papa's voice I think I hear,
Upon the ocean deep;
He cries for help or he will sink,
He calls for you and me,
Oh, mama, why did papa go
So far a-way at sea? 

3.
Your papa went, because, my child,
His duty call'd him there;
So let us now for his return
Together make a prayer;
That vision, love is rather strange,
I cannot think him dead;
So now lie down, my pretty one,
And rest your little head.
