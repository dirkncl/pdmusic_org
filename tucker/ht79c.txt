To my friend, Harry Spiers, Esq., Brooklyn, N.Y.
"Mabel, or, Hanging on the Gate" (1879)
by Henry Tucker
from "Four Vocal Gems" [#2]

1.
And where were you just now, Mabel?
Where have you been so long?
The moon is up, and the birds
Have sung their evening song.

I saw you loit'ring down the path,
So lonely and so late.
Beyond the wall and lilac bush,
And hanging on the gate.

I love to hear the birds, mother,
And see the rising moon,
And oh! the summer air is sweet,
Beneath the sky of June.

My cow is milked, my hens are cooped,
And washed are my cup and plate.
And so I wandered out awhile,
To hang upon the gate.

2.
The gate is by the road, Mabel?
And idle folks go by,
Nor should a maiden break the glance
Of ev'ry stranger eye.

Besides, I thought I saw a asp,
I'm sure you a a mate,
So tell me who was with you, child,
Just hanging on the gate.

Now you know just as well, mother,
'Twas only Harry Gray,
He spoke such words to me tonight,
I knew not what to say.

And mother, ah! for your dear sake,
I only bade him wait,
And mays't I run and tell him now,
He's hanging on the gate.
