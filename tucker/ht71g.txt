"My Mother's Wedding Ring" (1871)
Words by Samuel N. Mitchell
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
When clover blossoms scent the air,
And the birds their carols sing,
When buttercups and daisies bloom,
To thee I'll give this ring;
My mother wore it long ago,
And when she left me here,
She bade me wear it till I found
Thy true heart fond and dear.

CHORUS
When clover blossoms scent the air,
And birds their carol sing,
I'll give to thee this precious prize,
My mother's wedding ring.

2.
You'll meet me in the clover then,
I know you will, my love!
And take from me the gift of her
Who now is far above;
My father gave it once to her,
When she was young like you,
She bade me dying keep it till
I found a heart most true.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come when the noonday sun illumes
The meadow with its rays;
Be sure and choose the brightest of
The golden summer days;
Come all alone and meet me love!
For you are sweet and kind,
And have the true and loving heart
My mother bade me find.

(CHORUS)
