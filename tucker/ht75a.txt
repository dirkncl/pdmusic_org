(Ballad)
from "Songs and Ballads

Words by C. O. Clayton
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
He said that ere the bloom of Spring
Would swell the orchard leaves,
Or welcome birds their gladness sing
From  out the cottage eaves,
That he again would hasten home
To friends and kindred dear,
But Spring's soft bloom has come and gone,
And yet his is not here!
But Spring's soft bloom has come and gone,
And yet he is not here!
Alas! he is not here.

2.
Yes, rip'ning Summer's with us new,
And golden its scene--
The blushing fruit is on the bough,
Low bends the heavy grain;
The melon too, with motl'd rind,
Upon the earth lies near,
The broom-corn's waving in the wind,
And yet he is not here!
The broom-corn's waving in the wind,
And yet he is not here!
Alas! he is not here.

3.
Warm rays of early Autumn shine
Far o'er the landscape wide,
And purple grapes drop from the vine
Upon the mountain side;
Oh! soon these mellow scenes depart,
For solemn Winter's near,
And fill'd with grief's my longing heart
To think he is not hear!
And fill'd with grief's my longing heart
To think he is not here!
Alas! he is not here.
