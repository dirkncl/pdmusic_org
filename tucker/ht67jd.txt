1. Oh, be joyful all ye lands!
Shout aloud for joy!
Take your harps within your hands!
Shout aloud for joy!

Serve your Lord with love and joy,
Let no wall of grief annoy,
And come before his presence with a song.

CHORUS [sung after after singing the 
first four lines of each verse again]
Oh, be joyful,
Shout aloud for joy,
Oh, be joyful, shout aloud for joy,

2. Know ye that the Lord is God!
Praise his holy name!
Know ye that the Lord is God!
Praise his holy name

For he made us and will keep
Faithful watch o’er all his sheep;
Dear Shepherd of the flock and fold above.

3. Enter in his gates with thanks!
And his courts with praise!
Enter in his gates with thanks!
And his courts with praise!

Poor return our hearts can give,
For the blessings we receive;
And ever may our voices sing his praise.

4. O how gracious is the Lord!
Ever good and kind!
Sing his praise with one accord;
Joined in heart and mind

For his mercies ever sure;
And his truth will still endure,
O shout aloud for joy of such a God.
