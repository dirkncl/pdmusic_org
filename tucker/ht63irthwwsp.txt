1. 
I remember the hour when sadly we parted,
The tears on you pale cheek glist’ning like dew,
When clasped in you arms almost broken hearted,
I swore by the bright sky I’d ever be true.
True to the love that nothing could sever,
And true to the flag of my country forever.

CHORUS 1 
Then weep not, love oh, weep not,
Think not hopes are vain,
For when this fatal war is over,
We shall surely meet again.

2. 
Oh let not, my own love, the summer winds, winging
Their sweet laden zephyrs o’er land and o’er sea,
Bring aught to your heart, with the autumn bird’s singing,
But hopes for the future, and bright dreams of me;
For while in your pure heart my mem’ry you’re keeping,
I ne’er can be lonely while waking or sleeping.

CHORUS 2 
Then, weep not, love, oh, weep not,
Think not hopes are vain,
For when this fatal war is over,
We shall surely meet again.

3. 
But if, while the loud shouts of vict’try are ringing
O’er the land that foul traitors have sought to betray,
You hear o’er the voices so joyfully singing,
That he who so loved you has fallen in the fray,
Oh, think that he’s gone where there’s dark treason never,
Where tears and sad partings are banished forever.

CHORUS 3 
Then weep, not, love, oh, weep not,
One hope is not vain,
For when the war of life is over,
We in Heav’n may meet again.
