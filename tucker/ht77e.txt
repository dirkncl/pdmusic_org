Music by H. G. Tucker [aka Henry Tucker???]

1. It came upon the midnight clear,
  That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
  To touch their hopes of gold;
Peace on earth, goodwill to men,
  From Heaven's all gracious King;
The world in solemn stillness lay,
  To hear the angels sing.

2.
Still through the sloven skies they came
  With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
  O'er all the weary world;
Above the sad and lonely plains
  They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
  The blessed and angels sing.

3.
O ye beneath life's crushing load,
  When forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
  With painful steps and slow!
Look now, for glad and golden hours
  Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road,
  And hear the angels sing.

4.
For lo, the days are hastening on
  By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever circling years
  Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shal own
  The Prince of Peace their King,
And the whole world send back the song
  Which now the angels sing.
