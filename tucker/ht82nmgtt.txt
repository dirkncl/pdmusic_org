1. Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
	Nearer to Thee, 
E’en though a cross it be, 
	That raiseth me; 
Still all my song shall be— 
Nearer, my God, to Thee! 
[Nearer, my God, to Thee!]
Nearer to Thee! 

[REPEAT each verse for
QUARTET or CHORUS]

2. Though, like the wanderer,
	The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me;
	My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
[Nearer, my God, to Thee!]
	Nearer to Thee!

3. There let the way appear,
	Steps unto Heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
	In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me—
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
[Nearer, my God, to Thee!]
	Nearer to Thee!

4. Then with my waking thoughts,
	Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs,
	Bethel I’ll raise;
So by my woes to be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
[Nearer, my God, to Thee!]
	Nearer to Thee!

5. Or if on joyful wing,
	Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot,
	Upward I fly;
Still all my song shall be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
[Nearer, my God, to Thee!]
	Nearer to Thee!
