1.
Beautiful dreams linger near me,
Visions of sweetest delight,
Coming with splendor to cheer me,
Thro' all the lone weary night;
Fairy like music is falling,
Softly and sweet on my ear,
Angelic voices are calling,
Beautiful dreams linger near.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Beautiful dreams linger
near me (Beautiful dreams linger near,)
Visions of sweetest de-
light, (Visions of sweetest delight,)
Coming with splendor to
cheer me (Coming with splendor to cheer,)
Thro all the lone weary
night. (Beautiful dreams.)

2.
Beautiful dreams never leave me,
Over my heart weave a spell,
Should you depart it would grieve me,
More than I ever could tell;
Bring to me joys long departed,
Bring to me faves so dear,
While I sleep on happy hearted,
Beautiful dreams linger near.
