1. Eastward the tempest drives scowling away,
I hear its deep growling afar;
Thro' its pall, black as night, see the fork'd lightnings play,
As God's blazing ar-rows of war!
But the bright "Bow of promise" bangs sweetly between,
And pencils the cloud with its lustre serene.
  But the bright "Bow of promise" bangs sweetly between,
  And pencils the cloud with its lustre serene.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
"Bow of promise!" Beauteous Bow, Beatiful Bow!
Lo the bight "Bow of promise" is painting the sky,
A token that peace to our terror is nigh!

2. Na-ture, with tears of the storm on her breast,
Looks smilingly up at the blue;
And a robin, as Phoebus looks forward, forth from the west,
Is bidding him sweetly adieu!
For the bright "Bow of promise" is arching o'erhead,
And emblem of peace, for the tempest has fled.
  For the bright "Bow of promise" is arching o'erhead,
  And emblem of peace, for the tempest has fled.

3. Brothers, this life is a cycle of storms;
Oft smitten are we it is true;
But aloft let us look when the sun of Hope warms,
And sing at the soul-cheering view.
For the bright "Bow of promise" is painting the sky
A token that peace to our terrow is nigh.
  For the bright "Bow of promise" is painting the sky
  A token that peace to our terrow is nigh.
