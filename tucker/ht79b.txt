"Down in Sweet Wyoming Vale" (1879)
Words by Arthur R. Lee, USA
Music by Henry Tucker
from "Clover Blossoms" [#1]

1.
Down in sweet Wyoming vale
With a maiden sad and pale
wander'd in the rosy month of June
When the clover blossoms rare
Scented all the summer air
As it floated 'tween the valley and the moon.
Down in sweet Wyoming vale
When the autumn leaves pale
And the clover blossom kiss'd the breeze no more
Where bright Susquehanna flows
There I pluck'd a faded rose
From a lowly mound that sleeps beside the shore.

2.
Down in sweet Wyoming vale
Now the wild November gale
Comes with wailing thro' the forest brown and star;
I must wander all alone
Whilst the wild wave mocks my moan
As it floats into this midnight of the year.
Down in sweet Wyoming vale
With a maiden sad and pale
The joy to walk on more to me is given
For a bridegroom from above
Came and bore away my love
And she walketh now a happy bride in heaven.
