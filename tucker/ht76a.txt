"Close Her Tender Eyes" (1876)
Ballad and Chorus
by Henry Tucker

1.
Close her eyes tenderly, thou who art wiser,
Peacefully fold the poor hands on her breast;
Do not be merciless, do not despise her,
Pity her loneliness, lay her to rest.
Homeless and penniless, he who adored her,
Stricken in youth by thy cold hand of death:--
Gone was all comfort the world could afford her,
Soon she grew weary, and sickened by death.

CHORUS
Close her eyes tenderly, thou who art wiser,
Peacefully fold the poor hands on her breast;
Do not be merciless, do not despise her,
Pity her loneliness, lay her to rest.

2.
Ah! cruel slander had filled her with sadness,
Pointed the finger of morn at her head;
She in wild agony, driven to madness,
Rushed to the river, and here she lies dead.
Close her eyes tenderly, do not despise her;
Gone is her spirit for judgement above;
O she was desolate, none to advise her,
She was so beautiful, true to her love.

(CHORUS)

CODA
Rest! Rest! weary one, rest! rest! rest!
