Saviour, like a shepherd lead us;
Much we need thy tendor care;
In thy pleasant pastures lead us;
For our use thy fields prepare;
Bless-ed Jesus, Bless-ed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, thine we are.

2.
We are thine, do thou befriend us;
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep thy flock; from sin defend us;
Seek us when we go astray;
Bless-ed Jesus, Bless-ed Jesus,
Hear, Oh hear us, when we pray.

(QUARTET)

3.
Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and power to free;
Bless-ed Jesus, Bless-ed Jesus,
We will early turn to thee.

Early let us seek thy favor;
Early let us do thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
With thy love our bosoms fill;
Bless-ed Jesus, Bless-ed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us; love us still.
