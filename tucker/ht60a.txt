"Do Not Heed Her Warning" (1860)
(Reply to the Gipsies Warning)
Words by Thomas Manahan
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Lady, do not heed her warning,
 Trust me, thou shalt find me true,
Constant in the light of morning
 I will ever be to you.
Lady, I will not deceive thee,
 Fill thy guileless heart with woe;
Trust me, Lady, and believe me,
 Sorrow thou shalt never know.

Trust me, Lady, trust me, Lady,
 Sorrow thou shalt never know.

2.
Lady, ev'ry joy would perish,
 Pleasures all would wither fast,
If no heart could love or cherish
 In this world of storm and blast;
E'en the stars that gleem above thee
 Shine the brightest in the night;
So would he who fondly loves thee
 In the darkness by thy light.

3.
Dawn beside the flowing river,
 Where the dark-green willow weeps,
Where the leafy branches quiver,
 There a gentle maiden sleeps;
In the morn a lonely stranger
 Comes and lingers many hours--
Lady, he's no heartless ranger,
 For he strewn her grave with flowers.

4.
Lady, heed thee not her warning,
 Lay thy soft white hand in mine,
For I seek no fairer laurel,
 Than the constant love of thine;
When the silver moon-light brightens
 Then shall slumber on my breast,
Tender words thy soul shall lighten,
 Lull thy spirit into rest.
