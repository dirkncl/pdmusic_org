1. Long tossed on error’s stormy tide,
No light to bless, no voice to cheer,
A stranger wand’ring far and wide,
Bereft of hope, a prey to fear;
I longed for rest, but knew no spot,
In which to moor my stormtossed bark;
No happy isle, no peaceful grot,
’Mid all the ocean wild and dark.

2. Sadly I ranged the deep unknown,
And sought my cup of joy to fill;
But, friendless, helpless, and alone,
I wandered on, an outcast still.
Anon, a star gleam’d o’er my way,
And pierced the murky gloom of night;
My darkness melted into day,
My dungeon flamed with heav’nly light.

3. I saw a pure and peaceful clime,
Where fruits and flowers perennial bloom,
Where beauty reigns undim’d by time,
Beyond the confines of the tomb;
And on that bright and radiant shore,
Where sacred pleasures ever roll,
Where pilgrims meet to part no more,
I saw the haven for my soul.

4. Eager I sought for some kind hand,
To guide me to that haven fair,
To bring my trembling bark to land,
And safely moor me ever there;
Then Christ, the star that round me shone,
Put forth his hand my soul to guide,
No longer friendless and alone,
I found a refuse by his side.
