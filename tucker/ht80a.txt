"The Lass That Lives Next Door" (1880)
Words by Jennie Nettles
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Oh, have you seen that bonnie lass
With locks of auburn hue,
With cheeks so like the roses' blush,
And eyes so bonnie blue;
A Rob Roy shawl thrown round her neck,
A jupe and coat she wore,
I wonder where on earth she's gone,
The lass that lives next door.

CHORUS
I'll seek her, and on bended knee
Her favor I'll implore,
For, Oh, she's all the world to me,
The lass that lives next door.

2.
There's lasses decked by fashion's hand
Go by so high and proud;
But, Maggie's far above them all,
With nature's charms endowed;
How oft I watched her bonnie head,
So gracefully she bore,
For, oh! she's grown so dear to me,
The lass that lives next door.

(CHORUS)

3.
No wildbird's song is half so sweet
As Maggie's voice to me;
For one glint of her sunny smile
Is worth the world to me.
No jewels can I offer her,
No wealth, or golden store;
But, oh! she'd stol'n my heart away,
The lass that lives next door.

(CHORUS)
