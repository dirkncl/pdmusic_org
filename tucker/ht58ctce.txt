1. Call the children early, mother,
  While the birds do sing,
While the dew is on the flowers
  Which by the hillside spring;
Oft repeat the waking word,
Till they rise to praise the Lord.
  Oft repeat the waking word
  Till they rise to praise the Lord.

2. Call the children early, father,
  While the dew is on,
Great the work that must be done
  Before the morning's gone;
Call them round the altar bright,
On which burns devotion's light.
  Call them round the altar bright,
  On which burns devotion's light.

3. Call the children early, teacher,
  To their wond'ring eyes,
Ev'ry sabbath day set forth
  The pearl of richest price;
Call them early to the Lord,
Thou shalt reap a rich reward.
  Call them early to the Lord,
  Thou shalt reap a rich reward.

4. Call the children early, shepherd,
  Give the lambs thy care,
See that they are folded safe
  Within the house of prayer;
Call them at the dawn of day,
Lead them in the narrow way.
  Call them at the dawn of day,
  Lead them in the narrow way.

5. Call the children, Spirit holy,
  With Thy word of power,
Call them early, call them early
  In the morning hour;
Ere their hearts in sin grow hard,
Ere the gate of heav'n is barred.
  Ere their hearts in sin grow hard,
  Ere the gate of heav'n is barred.
