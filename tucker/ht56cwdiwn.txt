1.
  Come Willie dear I'm weeping now.
The early blossoms deck the waving bough.
Gay heather-bells nod in the dells.
But winter clouds are on my lonely brow,
  Come oh! come to our highland home;
Gay heather-bells nod in the dells.
  But winter clouds are on my lonely brow.

2.
  There's greetin' here sin' ou'er the sea.
Went eauthie heart and eantie laugh wi' thee.
The birds of spring are sweetly sae sweetly sing.
Then Willie dear, oh! Willie come to me;
  Come oh! come to our highland home;
The birds of spring are sweetly sae sweetly sing.
  Then Willie dear, oh! Willie come to me.

3.
  Come Willie dear, my heart is lone;
The nightengale clings to the deserted stone;
Aboon the spring the Laverocks sing,
While I join in the mateless Cushat's moan.
  Come, oh, come to our highland home;
Aboon the spring the Laverocks sing,
  While I join the mateless Cushat's moan.

4.
  Come Willie dear our trysting tree,
Stands a' the same sin' ye stood there wi' me;
Each whisp'ring bough sighs softly now,
Come Willie dear, oh! Willie come to me.
  Come, oh! come to our highland home;
Each whisp'ring bough sighs softly now,
  Come Willie dear, oh! Willie come to me.
