"Violets Under the Snow" (1865)
Composed expressly for and sung by
Mademoiselle Parepa.
Words by C. H. H. Pannell.
Music by Henry Tucker.

1.
The April winds pip'd merry, and gay,
The April sun was burning bright,
And all the day had melted away
The snow drifts clear and white,
'Till the blue violet
In the snow set,
Was waken'd from sleep by its fiery light.

CHORUS
Oh! there's nothing so bright.
By day, or by night,
In all the season's ebb and flow,
As the clear blue eyes,
Like mimic skies,
Of violets under the snow.
As the clear blue eyes,
Like mimic skies,
Of violets under the snow.

2.
The April wasted into the May,
And still the Mayday sun was bright,
And all day long, in sun and song,
Had wasted the snowdrift white,
'Till the blue violet
In the white snow set,
Sprang up on the grave of the snowdrift white.

(CHORUS)
