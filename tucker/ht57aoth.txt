1. 
Alone on the heather a fair child was straying,
  Whose innocent features were brightened with joy,
And as mid the flowers he was carelessly playing,
  My heart yearned with love and I spoke to the boy;
"Young stanger Whence are thou?" His blue eyes upturning,
He answered, "My home is yon tent on the plain,
  And ere the eve closes, I must be returning,
Or they will not let me roam hither again."

2. 
"Do thy parents await thee?" he paused, and the gladness
  That mantled his brow was o’ershadowed with gloom;
"I saw them but once," and, he added with sadness,
  "They tell me that both are asleep in the tomb;
The gipsey is kind, but my mother was fonder;
  So sweetly she sung me to sleep in her arms;
But now she is gone and her darling must wander,
  Tho’ the soft words she whispered my bosom still warms."

3. 
"But soon will I seek where both are reposing,
  And take my best flowers to plant by their side;
That summer when all its bright tints are unclosing,
  May bless the green turf with its beauty and pride;"
He bounded away as my sad tears were falling,
  To think how the gipseys such love had beguiled;
I saw him no more, yet the sad tale recalling,
  I often remember the poor stolen child.
