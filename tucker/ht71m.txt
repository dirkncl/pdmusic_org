To Miss Sara Wilson, (Perskill, NJ)
"Under the Beautiful Blossoms" (1871)
Song & Chorus
Words by Authur W. French
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Under the beautiful blossoms,
Under the crimson and white,
Bright eyes hid from the sunshine,
Never to see see its sweet light.
Dreams of a sunnyfaced maiden,
Lying so silent asleep,
Fall on my breast in its sadness,
Sacred in mem'ry to keep.

CHORUS
Under the beautiful blossoms,
Under the crimson and white,
Never to meet or to greet me,
Sleeps my lost darling tonight.

2.
Fair was my love as the blossoms,
Pure as their raiment of white;
But like the blossoms she faded,
Faded away from my sight.
Rough was this earth for the treading
Of her fair daintywhite feet,
So, growing weary of wand'ring,
Strayed they away from life sweet.

(CHORUS)

3.
Whisper, ye beautiful blossoms,
Bend your heads ever so low,
Say in your mystical language,
To her that sleepeth below--
"Over the shadowy river,
In the bright mansions of gold,
We'll be united forever,
As in the glad days of old."

(CHORUS)
