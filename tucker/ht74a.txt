"Don't Forget the Old Folks" (1874)
Words and Music by Henry Tucker

Don't forget the old folks,
Love them more and more,
As they with unshrinking feet,
Near the shining shore.
Let your words be tender,
Loving, soft and low,
Let their last days be the best,
They have known below.

Don't forget, Dear Father,
With his failing sight,
And his locks come thick and brown,
Scanty, now and white.
Tho' he may be childish,
Still do you be kind;
Think of him as years ago,
With his "master mind."

Refrain
Don't forget the old folks,
Love them more and more,
As they with unshrinking feet,
Near the shining shore;
Let your words be tender,
Loving, soft and low,
Let their last days be the best,
They have known below.

Don't forget sweet Mother,
With her furrow'd brow,
Once as fair, and smooth and white,
As the driven snow;
Are her steps uncertain?
Is her hearing poor?
Guide her gently till she lands,
Safe at heaven's door.

{Refrain)
