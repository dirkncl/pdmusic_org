1. To and and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!
Here and there, everywhere, joyous song we’re singing;
Loud and clear, full of cheer, happy tones are ringing.
To and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!

2. To and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!
We will tell, we will tell of the wondrous story,
While we raise songs of praise to our Lord in glory.
To and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!

3. To and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!
Through the world, through the world, doing angel’s duty,
Bright and fair, bright and fair, clothed in angel beauty.
To and fro, to and fro, hear the tread of little children,
As they go, as they go; busy march of busy feet!
