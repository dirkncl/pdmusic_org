"General Grant's the Man" (1868)
Words by George Cooper
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
O! "reconstruction" is the rage
All over this fair land,
And in the game it's very clear
That all should take a hand;
We want a bran new President
And only one will answer
But sure as guns he'll take the chair,
For General Grant's our man, sir.

Chorus
Tell us, tell us! time will tell the tale.
Tell us, tell us! the cause can never fail.
Now the "cruel war" is over here,
Yet still we've work to do,
Then three time three for E. S. G.
And General Grant's our man, sir.


2.
Our candidate has never "ran"
For office, that we know,
And certainly he's never "run"
From any mortal foe!
The "boys in blue" tell the tale
Wherev'r they get the chance, sir,
They won't forget the days of old,
And General Grant's the man, sir.

(Chorus)

3.
He'll make the nation brighten up
Just like his own agar;
And all discordant elements
He'll quiet near and far;
So-- on "this line we'll fight it well"
It's sure to be our plan, sir.
Then "three times three" for E. S. G.
O! General Grant's the man, sir.

(Chorus)
