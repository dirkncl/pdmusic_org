1.
The musket hangs upon the wall, the knapsack's laid aside,
The fight is won, no more we'll wade in battle's ragind tide,
But boys we'll keep our powder dry, we know not what may come,
Though all is fair and peaceful now 'neath Freedom's lofty dome,
And if the dawn of War should come while loyal hearts remain,
"We'll take the old familiar guns and go with Grant again."

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
"We'll go with Grant again my boys,
We'll go with Grant again, Hurrah!
We'll take the old familiar guns and go with Grant again."

2.
Oh! never be our brother, boys, the foe that we must meet,
But altogether let our lips the Union song repeat;
The stars once more upon our flag are gleaming in their might;
Then let the past be buried, boys, the future now is bright,
But should "outsiders" rouse our boys, and hopes of concord wane,
"We take the old familiar guns and go with Grant again."

3.
There seems to be a little clould just rising in the sky;
Napoleon, down in Mexico, is fighting rather shy,
But Uncle Sam has let him know that he had better quit;
We're slow to take offence, my boys, but "mighty hard" to hit;
If Maximilian will not go, the way to fix him's plain,
"We'll take the old familiar guns and go with Grant again."

CODA (ad lib) after CHORUS to last verse.
"For auld lang syne" my boys, "for auld lang syne,"
We'll take the old familiar guns and go with Grant again.
