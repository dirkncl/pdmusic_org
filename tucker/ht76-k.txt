1.
Rocked in the cradle of the deep,
I lay me down in peace to sleep;
Secure I rest upon the wave,
For thee, O Lord, hast powet the save:
I know thou wilt not slight my call,
For thou dost mark the sparrow's fall:
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep,
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep.

2.
And such the trust that still were mine,
Though stormy winds swept o'er the brine;
Or though the tempest's fiery breath
Roused me from sleep to wreck and death!
In ocean cave, still safe with thee,
The gem of immortality;
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep;
And calm and peaceful is my sleep,
Rocked in the cradle of the deep.
