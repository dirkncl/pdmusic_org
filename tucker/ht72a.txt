"I Have Missed You Mollie Darling" (1872)
Words by Arthur W. French
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
I have miss'd you Mollie darling,
  from the spot we know so well,
Where I kissed you Mollie darling,
  long ago a sweet farewell.
Smiles of thine no more may great me
  While your voice I never hear,
Will you come again to greet me,
  For I miss you Mollie dear.

Chorus
Yes I've miss'd [Yes I've miss'd] you Mollie darling,
  More than words [More than words] of mine can tell,
Since I kissed you Mollie darling,
  Long ago a sweet farewell.

2.
I have miss'd you Mollie darling,
  miss'd the sunlight of your smile,
And the kisses Mollie darling,
  that you gave me by the stile,
I have listened in the gleaming
  for your footsteps drawing near,
Waiting vainly for your coming,
  for I miss you Mollie dear.

(Chorus)
