1.
There's a Harp in the dusky room Mother,
And a stirring of Golden strings,
A quiv'ring of angel tones in song,
A folding of spirit wings
Yet I hear in the busy street Mothers,
The crowd go hurrying by,
They will gather and greet and part the same,
When "_Lettie_" in death shall sleep.

2.
Oh bear to my Willie love, Mothers,
With the news of this hour to him,
Say his parting look is a treasure now;
As the light of life is dim,
That I'll come with my older smile Mother,
On the night we set to wed,
And my spirit will linger near to him,
His Bride with the vows unsaid.

3.
Oh what tho' my bosom ne'er thrill Mother,
With the tremor of Earthy bliss,
And [parting look is a treasure now,
As the light of life is dim,
That I'll] shine on his lonely way Mother,
A star on the fretted sea,
And his heart will thrill with a sudden joy
And know that its nearer me.
