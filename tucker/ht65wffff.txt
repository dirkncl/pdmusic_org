1.
Oh, I'm the boy that wears the green
In spite of England's power;
And in the future mist is seen
Sweet Erin's coming hour;
Then keep your arms prepared to strike,
Old Ireland's sure to need them;
Saint Pattrick will defend the right
When Fenians fight for Freedom.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Roll on! Roll on! time will tell the tale,
Roll on! Roll on! the cause can never fail,
Now the "cruel was is" over here,
Let Ireland strike the blow,
And we'll win the fight for "right is might,"
When Fenians fight for Freedom.

2.
Then raise the glorious flag of green,
And strike the Harp of Erin;
Your hearts are bold, your blades are keen,
Tis not the hour to fear in;
And should your children, orphans be,
Your country's love will feed them;
Awake! arise! and cross the sea
When Fenians fight for Freedom.
