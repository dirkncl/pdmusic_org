"The Silver Slipper" (1873)
Words by Samuel N. Mitchell
Music by Henry Tucker
Song with Two Posture Dances,
a Waltzing Chorus, and Jig.

1.
The moon was brightly shining, and a million little stars
Sent down their rays upon her as I saw her through the bars;
A merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the feature,
But the fairest flower is that boquet was that charming little creature.

[CHORUS]
She was dancing 'neath the arbor green,
Oh, she was just a clipper,
And every time she tossed her foot
She showed a silver slipper.

O I can't forget
The sweet and lovely pet.

The neatest ever seen,
A perfect little queen.

[Tempo di valse.]
For underneath the arbor I watched that lively clipper.
And now my thoughts are centered on her little silver slipper.

(Tempo di valse.)

2.
Her hair was all in ringlets and a wreath of roses fair
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer air;
A fascinating smile she had, her cheeks of ruby hue,
And right along a Roman nose, two eyes of violet blue.

(Chorus)
(Tempo di valse. -- twice)

3.
I watched her all the evening while my poor and wretched heart
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a part;
The fates they were against me for a fence stood just between
Me and that laughing, jolly crowd that between the bars were seen.

(Chorus)
(Tempo di valse. -- twice)
