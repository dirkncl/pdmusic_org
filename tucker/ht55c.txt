To Matt Peel, Esq.
"The Grave of Flora" (1855)
Ballad & Chorus
Written & Sung by John Farenberg
of West & Peel's Original Cambell Minstrels
Composed by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
How bright was the morning though gloomy the day,
When Flora our darling was borne far away
And the tears of the old, the young and the brave,
Were shed in deep silence round Flora's cold grave.
The mother in sorrow with accents so wild,
In prayers deepest anguish wept over the child.

CHORUS
Then sleep gentle Flora where violets wave,
Beneath the old yew tree that shelters thy grave,
Where nought save the whisper of light zephyrs breath,
Shall waft o're thy grave so silent in death.

2.
How sweet was the child as it knelt down in prayer,
It smil'd as it lisp'd for that mother was there
With uplifted hands, she sought him who could save
And whisper'd tis bright, mother, beyond the dark grave;
Oh look dearest mother, the heavens have smil'd,
I'm going, I'm going, grieve not for your child.

(CHORUS)

3.
In the old church yard near, by the brook's quiet rill,
Nought is heard but the cry of the lone whipporwill;
And violets blossom in spring near that brook,
Beneath the old yew tree that shelters the nook,
Where sleeps gentle Flora whose prayer while she smil'd,
Was "here dearest mother, lay Flora your child."

(CHORUS)
