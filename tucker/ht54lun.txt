"Leave Us Not" (1854)
Composed May _1845 for Miss Virginia E. Dickinson,
(late Mrs. Henry Murray) since deceased.
Ballad.
Composed by Henry Tucker (1826-1882)

Leave us not
Leave us not
Say not adieu.
Have we not been to thee
Tender and true?
Take not thy sunny smile
Far from our hearth,
With that sweet light will fade
Summer and mirth.

Leave us not
Leave us not
Can thy heart roam?
Wilt thou not pine to hear
Voices from home?
Too sad our loves would be
If thou art gone.
Turn to us -- leave us not --
Thou art our own.
