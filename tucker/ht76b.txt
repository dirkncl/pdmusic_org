To Mrs. John Dunbar Vincent, Brooklyn, N.Y.
"The Flowers Will Bloom in May!" (1876)
Ballad with Chorus ad lib.
Words by Arthur W. French.
Music by Henry Tucker.

1.
O, sweetheart, don't be sighing,
The winter won't be long.
Soon merry birds are coming
To cheer the earth with song;
For though it be December,
And death and drear the day,
Be cheerful, and remember
The flow'rs will bloom in May.

REFRAIN
The flow'rs will bloom in May,
Sweet flow'rs will bloom in May,
And hearts now sad will then be glad.
The flow'rs will bloom in May.
The flow'rs will bloom in May.

2.
'Tis ever thus in sorrow,
The winter of the heart;
Some golden fair tomorrow,
Will see it all depart;
And Love's own birds be singing
Their carols sweet and gay,
While wedding bells are ringing,
The flow'rs will bloom in May.
