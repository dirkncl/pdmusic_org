To Miss Anna V.H.T. Adams
"The Land Beyond the Sea" (1871)
Words by (the late) Catherine A.V.B. Adams
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Beautiful Land beyond the sea,
Angels call me now to thee.
And I hear great breakers roar
On its long and distant shore.

CHORUS
Beautifil Land (Beautifil Land)
Beautifil Land (Beautifil Land)
Beautiful Land beyond the sea...
Beautiful Land, Beautiful Land
Angels now call me to thee.

2.
There the spirits free from death
Life's renewed with ev'ry breath
For the soul shall bud and flower
To its own most perfect power.

(CHORUS)
