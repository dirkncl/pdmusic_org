1. 
Dear Scotia tho’ far from thy heath covered hills, 
Thy glens widely winding thy musical rills, 
Thy highlands where nature looks grand from her throne, 
Thy lowlands that Beauty has claim’d for her own. 

CHORUS
We see thee again ev’ry feature returns 
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS, 
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS.

2. 
Though we tread with affection fair liberty’s earth, 
How deeply we love thee thou land of our birth; 
Dear land of our birth shall we cease to retain 
Our fondness? no! never while life shall remain, 

CHORUS
But warmer each bosom with tenderness yearns, 
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS, 
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS.



3. 
Oh, Burns! Robbie Burns haughty man on thee frowned, 
Yet thy brow by man’s Maker sublimely was crowned; 
Though rank gave no gauds and keen poverty stung, 
How noble how lofty the strains from thy tongue; 

CHORUS
Enraptured each bosom false dignity spurns,
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS, 
As we sing the sweet songs of our own ROBBIE BURNS.
