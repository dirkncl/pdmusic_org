"Weeping, Sad and Lonely; or
When This Cruel War Is Over" (1863)
Lyrics: Charles Carroll Sawyer
Music: Henry Tucker, 1862

1.
Dearest love do you remember,
When we lst did meet,
How you told me that you loved me,
Kneeling at my feet?
Oh! How proud you stood before me,
In your suit of blue,
When you vow'd to me and country,
Ever to be true 

CHORUS 
Weeping, sad and lonely,
Hopes and fears, how vain,
when this cruel war is over,
Praying! That we meet again. 

2.
When the summer breeze is sighing,
Mournfully along
Or when autumn leaves are falling,
Sadly breathes the song.
Oft in dreams I see thee lying,
Oh the battle plain,
Lonely, wounded, even dying,
Calling but in vain. 

(CHORUS)

3.
If amid the din of battle,
Nobly you should fall,
Far away from those who love you,
None to hear your call.
Who would whisper words of comfort,
Who would soothe your plain?
Ah! The many cruel fancies,
Ever in my brain. 

(CHORUS)
