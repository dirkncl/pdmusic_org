A Scotch Song.
Written by James Ballentine, Edinburgh.
Composed by Henry Tucker

1.
Though cauld and drear our muirland home
Among the wreaths o' smaw,
Yet loves here lows wi' purest flame
Than lights the lordly Ha".
For [ilka] shepherds chequered plaid
Has room enough for twa,
And costly shields his mountain maid
Frae a the blasts that blow.

REFRAIN
Then hey the plaid the "Grey Hill" plaid
That haps the heart the heart so true.
Dear dear in ev-ry mountain maid
One plaid and bonnet blue.

2.
What though we're few upon this muir
We le' each other mare.
And is the weary wand'rin' pair
We've comfort aye to spare.
The heart that feels for others worn
Can ne'er keep love awa'.
And two young hearts when beatin' close
Can never long be twa.

(REFRAIN)
