1.
I kiss'd her lip and left her side,
  In spring's young balmy time,
When ev'ry blossom seems a bride,
  And waters, waters flow in rhyme:
The birds were warbling in the bowers,
  The dew slept on the spray,
And nature sought in vain with flowers,
  To rival Agnes May.

2.
When winter from his silent wing,
  Had shed the stainless snow,
And crown'd each forest tree a king,
  And seal'd, seal'd the wild brook's flow;
My footsteps sought her quiet home,
  But sadly turned away,
Alas! that I should live to come,
  And find not Agnes May.

3.
She sleeps beneath the wither'd grass,
  And knows not I am there,
To cheat the tardy hours that pass,
  And moan, and moan my sorrows prayer;
They say the spring again shall be,
  To make the mourners gay,
Alas! that were no spring to me,
  That brought not Agnes May.
