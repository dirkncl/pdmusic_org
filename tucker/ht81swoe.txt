"Sweet Wind of Eve" (1881)
A Romance.
Words from the French, by L. A. C.
[Lydia Avery Coonley?]
Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
Sweet wind of eve, around my window playing,
With blue "forget-me-nots," and roses crimson brown.
Oh! fragrant, flutt'ring breeze, perchance, amid thy straying,
Thou'lt wander where my dreams my fondest thoughts are flown.

2.
Sweet wind of eve, O! may thy soft caresses,
The purest sighs of love still breathe around her there.
On her fair neck of snow unroll her shining tresses,
And happy faint and die amid her golden hair.

3.
Sweet wind of eve, Oh, whisper to her sleeping,
In murm'ring music, low thy dreamy melody,--
While I! in tears and pray'rs my lonely vigil keeping,
In darkness kneeling, sing of her so far away!
