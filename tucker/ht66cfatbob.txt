1.
Come from afar thou birdling of beauty
Waken the woods with thy sweet notes again
Bid all the echoes from valley and mountain
Chant to thy music their softest regrain
How have I missed thee thou birdling of beauty,
Through the long season of winter and gloom,
From the dark woods comes no melody stealing,
Over the valleys no breath of perfume.

CHORUS
Come from afar, (Come from afar,)
Come from afar, (from afar,)
Birdling of beauty Oh, come from afar,
Come from afar, (Come from afar,)
Come from afar, (from afar,)
Birdling of beauty Oh, come from afar.

2.
Hushed are thy warblings thou birdling of beauty
Lonely the haunts where thy sweet voice was heard,
Leaflet and rivulet mournfully sighing
Wait but to herald thy coming sweet bird,
Linger no longer thou birdling of beauty,
Hasten, the pleasures we pine for, to bring,
Nature will charm me not if thou art absent,
Spring is returning! Oh, come with the spring.

(CHORUS)
