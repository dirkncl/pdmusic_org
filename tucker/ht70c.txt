"Meet Me, Nannie! Blue-eyed Nannie" (1870)
Poetry by William W. Long
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
When the golden sun is drinking
To his home behind the hill,
And the sephyrs softly murmur
Round the old and ruined mill,
When the birds have ceased their warbling,
And the flowers have gone to sleep,
Meet me, Nannie, blue-eyed Nannie,
When the stars their night-watch keep.

CHORUS
When the birds (when the birds) have ceased their warbling,
And the flowers have gone to sleep,
Meet me, "Nannie," (Meet me, "Nannie,") blue-eyed "Nannie,"
When the stars their night-watch keep.

2.
Come, sweet Nannie, softly whisper,
If you love me still as true
As when first our troth was plighted
On the grass all wet with dew.
I am waiting for you, Nannie,
By the tree we love so well,
And the eve-ning bells are tolling
To the summer day "farewell."

(CHORUS)
