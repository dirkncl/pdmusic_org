"Beside the Sweet Shannon" (1877)
Song and Chorus
in Response to "Eilleen Allana"
Words and Music
by Henry Tucker

1.
Beside the sweet Shannon at ev'ning I stray,
Fondly thinking, dear Dermot, of thee,
And the hour we plighted our faith 'neath the stars,
Ere you left me to cross the wide sea.
Oh! the night-bird is wailing sad notes to his mate,
While the breeze whispers low in the tree,
As I cry out aloud with my heart full of tears,
Dear Dermot, come back, love, to me.

CHORUS
Oh! the night-bird is wailing sad notes to his mate,
While the breeze whispers low in the tree,
As I cry out aloud with my heart full of tears,
Dear Dermot, come back, love, to me.

2.
As I gaze at the stars in the soft summer eve,
Sadly dreaming, dear Dermot, of thee,
Sure I pray in my heart, that, wherever thou art,
The bright stars may soon guide thee to me.
O darling, come back to your "Eilleen Asthore,"
When the spring-flow'rs are painting the lea,
With our love in a cabin, we've richess galore,
Then come back, dear Dermot, to me.

(CHORUS)
