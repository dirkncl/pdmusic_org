"The Fireman's Child" (1858)
Words by Gardiner Coyne
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
The night was dark, the tempest howled,
  Oh how my mother wept,
As mem'ry bro't the hour back
  When quietly we slept
Our dreams of bliss were broken
  By the loudly tolling bell
Sounding the dread alarmum,
  Fire echoed, echoed with the knell.

Chorus
With hand ands hearts so steady,
  As the cry of fire runs wild,
Still the motto "Ever ready"
  Is before the Fireman's Child.
The motto "Ever ready"
  Is before the Fireman's Child.

2.
My father heedless of the storm
  Quick to his duty ran;
With anxious prayer my mother cried
  "Oh Hean'n preserve each man!"
Till weary hours and tidings bro't
  Grief did her heart appal;
My father and his comrades
  Were buried, buried 'neath the wall!

(Chorus)

3.
But scarce a year had passed away
  Ere of grief my mother died,
And left in solitude alone,
  How often have I sighed.
Yet though an orphan left on earth
  To roam this world so wild,
Heav'n smiles, ne'er deserts the noble,
  The noble Fireman's Child.

(Chorus)
