To Wash. L. Lewis, New York
"Let's Go In and Take a Stew" (1870)
Song & Chorus (waltz adlib)
Sung by S. S. Purdy
Composed by Henry Tucker

1.
I wandered forth one autumn night with a fair one on my arm,
We talk'd of love and tea and toast and other things as warm,
When turning into Becker street, We'd nothing else to do,
The lady cried in accents wild "Lets go in and take a stew"
I gazed afraid upon the maid I thought her brain was turned
Yet could not still the clamor of the heart that in my burned,
I wandered at her exclamation--Wouldn't one of you?
I press'd her hand, Again she said "Let's go in and take a stew."

CHORUS (or Refrain)
Oh! do, oh! do, Oh! do, oh! do,
If it's all the same to you,
My heart is light I've an appetite
Let's go in and take a stew.

2.
Out then I spoke and pleading still recounted all my love
I called her sweet pet names, My joy, my darling and my dove;
But though she sighed, my squeeze returned, her accents still were few,
She only said, with tearful eyes "let's go in and take the stew."
Oh much I marvelled that at this strange reticence of hers,
And feared here monomania might turn to something worse;
The visions of asylums and straight jackets burst in view,
And then she said in dulcet tones "let's go in and take a stew."

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh then my fears upset me quite I shrieked and tore my hair,
When pausing in here walk, she said, "oh look just over there!"
I looked I saw a mammoth sign which she was pointing to,
And there in words of fire I read, "lets go in and take a stew"
Releived of all my wretched fears, we lingered on the spot,
The fleeting moments sped away, and still we left it not,
Till mustering all my courage while the tears fell was as dew,
I clasped her in my arms and we, went in and had a "stew."

(CHORUS)
