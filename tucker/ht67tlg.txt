1. 
[DUET]
Oh say, oh say, what shall we do, 
We restless girls and boys, 
What exercise shall we go through, 
To add to all our joys; 
We play and run, and have such fun, 
That people think we’re mad, 
And now good friends, we every one, 
Will try and make you glad. 

FULL CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We’ll rise and fall, grow short and tall, 
We’ll clap, and stamp, and whirl, 
With our pluribus unimus, how do you do, 
We’re happy boys and girls.

2. 
[DUET]
Our youthful limbs must thrive and grow, 
Perhaps you know the fact, 
That if we sit bent like a bow, 
We’'ll all have crooked backs;
Then let us rise, and exercise
Each muscle, nerve, and limb,
For every one, may if he tries,
Grow up quite straight and trim. 

3. 
[DUET]
We’ll point to this, we’ll point to that,
We’ll point above, below,
We’ll look to right, we’ll look to left,
And up and down just so;
We’ll laugh and cry, and wink one eye,
Then quickly wink the other;
And then we’ll kiss you all good bye,
And trudge off home to mother.
