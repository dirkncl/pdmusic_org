1.
Mother! Mother! in the doorway,
Waiting, waiting for a word;
Watching, watching for a message,
Tearful! trusting in the Lord.
Would our wealth of love could nerve you,
Would a people's pray'r could serve you,
And good cheer afford.

CHORUS
Mother! Mother! in the doorwar,
Waiting, waiting for a word;
Watching, watching for a message,
Tearful! trusting in the Lord.

2.
Mother! Mother! in the doorway,
Stricken with a mother's grief,
You are looking where the lonely---
We are told --- will find relief;
Looking for beyond the valley,
Toward the field where soldiers rally,
From the battle brief.

(CHORUS)

3.
Mother! Mother! in the doorwar,
Courage! in this hour of woe,
For the nation's soul is with him,
Though the waters ebb flow;
With our hist'ry his is written
And our hearts with yours are smitten,
And our heads are low.

(CHORUS)
