"Saucy 'Sue'" (11 Jan. 1882)
(VOWELS.)
>*Serio Comic Song.*<
by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
Oh, "Sue," you saucy darling,
You've charmed my heart away;
I love you in the morning,
And I love you all the day.
You're sometimes kind and gentle,
And my heart is lifted high,
But when you're cross and wayward,
Then I think I'll surely die.
(_Spoken._ That's "Yorkshire."_)

CHORUS 2 times.
Say so, "Susie," saucy "Susie,"
Never, never leave me for to sigh so, "Sue,"
If you love me, saucy "Sue,"
Why wouldn't it be better for to say so, "Sue?"

2.
Now "Sue," you know I love you,
I'm sure you love me too;
But when I thought I had you,
Like a flea, away you flew.
But "flea," or "flitch of bacon;"
Like a "magpie" of a "fly;"
Oh, Susie if you'll have me,
There'll be more so gay as I.
(_Spoken._ That's "Yorkshire."_)

(CHORUS 2 times.)
