1.
On a summer night,
By the silv’ry light, 
Of the moon in the a zure sky;
Like a dewdrop clear,
There glistened a tear
In a maiden’s thoughtful eye.

2.
The fairry like sound,
Of music around
Had broken the silence deep,
And a mellow song
Was borne along
To the half waken’d dreamer’s Sleep.

3.
A lute’s sweet chord
And the well known word
Of that song as they lingered near
Had touch’d her heart
And caus’d to start
Her eyes that trembling tear.
