1.
Gently blows the night breeze,
  On thy grassy bed,
Softly move the green trees,
  Over thy young head,
Sweetly sing the glad birds,
  Tremblingly and low
Murmur soft the bright rills
  Weeping as they go.

2.
Mournfully the tall grass,
  Nods above thy breast
Sighing may the winds pass,
  O'er thy place of rest;
Each low breath a dirge be
  For the young, the brave,
Slumbering thus quietly
  In his early grave.

3.
Spring's sweet flowers shall bloom, love,
  Modestly and fair,
O'er thy early tomb, love,
  Shedding perfume there;
One shall linger near, love,
  While the strength be given
To shed the silent tear, love,
  And dream of thee and Heav'n.
