Temperance Songs."

1.
Stay home with me tonight, Tom,
Don't put my arms away,
If they one gentle mem'ry wake,
That pleads with you to stay.
Oh think of all my love for you,
Before you quit my sight,
And change your mind for once, dear Tom,
Stay home with me tonight.

CHORUS
Oh, think of all my love for you,
Before you quit my sight,
And change your mind for once, dear Tom,
Stay home with me tonight.

2.
Stay home with me tonight, Tom,
Just as you used to do,
I will not say one single word,
You would not have me to.
Oh Tom, my love can be as sweet,
My touch can be as light,
As when you loved me first, dear Tom,
Stay home with me tonight.

(CHORUS)

3.
I think while you hear me speak, Tom,
And I believe it true,
'Tis not alone my voice your hear,
But our dead baby's too,
Oh Tom! your eyes are full of tears,
Your arms are 'round me tight,
You'll stay at home, my darling Tom,
Home, home with me tonight.

(CHORUS)
