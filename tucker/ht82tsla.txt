To Mrs. EMILY F. HENNING, Oshkosh, Wis.
"The Sweet Long Ago" (11 Jan. 1882)
Ballad.
Song and Chorus.
By Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
As we list to the praise of the "Sweet by-and-by",
With music so sweet that the tear dims the eye,
And the heart's fill'd with longing, 'tis well it is so;
But let's turn a page of the sweet long ago.
In the morning of life, when with hope in our breast,
We battled with care and we ne'er thought of rest,
Then old Father Time seemed so wofully,--
Life's pathway before us in the sweet long ago.

CHORUS
Sweet long ago, yes! the sweet long ago;
Let's turn a page of the sweet long ago,
The sweet long ago, yes! the sweet long ago;
Let's tuen a page of the sweet long ago.

2.
Ah, many the joys of the dear olden time;
The mist which surrounds it but makes it sublime;
When life's labor's done, and our heads are laid low;
Then others will sing of the sweet long ago.
The lips that are now young will soon sing the praise,
And join in the song of their own youthful days;
Then the "Sweet by-and-by," with its music so low
Will go hand in hand with the sweet long ago.

(CHORUS)
