"Oh! Let Him Rest" (1864)
Ballad and Chorus

Words by James T. Dudley
Music by Henry Tucker

Verse 1
=======
O let him rest, in the valley's breast,
Away from care and pain,
No more at home they'll bid him "come
With that sweet voice again."

Yes let him sleep while lov'd ones weep,
And whisper sad good bye's,
Their tearful grief shall find relief,
In "dear old memories."

Chorus
======
Then let him rest in the valley's breast,
On the shore of that beautiful river;
The echo's still of his harp shall thrill,
Our raptur'd ears forever.

Verse 2
=======
O let him res, in the valley's breast,
Where the bird's he lov'd so well,
Shall gladly come, from woodland home,
His praises sweet to tell.

The Bluebird's note shall softly float,
In sweetest melody,
As in days of yore it linger'd o'er,
"The grave of Eulalie"

[Repeat Chorus]

Verse 3
=======
Then let him rest, in the valley's breast,
His harp is hush'd forever,
He's gone before to the silent shore,
Where death no more can sever.

And while we weep, as he lies asleep,
And fondly breathe his praise,
We'll still rejoice as we hear the voice,
of "By gone days."

[Repeat Chorus]
