"No Night in Heaven" (10 Nov 1883)
from "Bud and Flowers.
A Choice Collection of Vocal Gems."
Sacred Song and Qartette.
by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
No night shall be in heav'n, no gath'ring gloom
Shall o'er that glorious landscape over come;
No tears shall fall in sadness, on those flowers
That breathe their fragrance through celestial bowers;

No night shall be in heav'n, forbid to weep,
These eyes no more their mournful vigils keep,
Their fountains dried, their tears all wip'd away,
They gaze, undazzled on eternal day.

CHORUS
No night shall be in heav'n above,
Now bright the radiance of His love
Our earth-born tears forever wip'd away,
We gaze, undazzled on eternal day.

2.
No night shall be in heav'n, no darken'd room,
No bed of death, no silence of the tomb;
But breezes ever fresh with love and truth,
Shall nerve the frame with ar[?] immortal youth;

No night shall be in heav'n, oh, had I faith
To rest in what the faithful Witness saith,
That faith should make these hideous phantoms flee,
And leave no night hence forth on earth, for me.

(CHORUS)
