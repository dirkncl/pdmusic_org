1. 
Sadly now I make my mourn, 
Breathing forth my life in sighs; 
Minnie to the grave is bourne, 
And my heart is where she lies.   

CHORUS
Softly, freely fall the tears, 
Sadly pass the hours away; 
Nothing now my spirit cheers, 
Since they burried Minnie Gray.

2. 
Oh the bliss almost divine, 
When her plighted love she gave; 
Ah how brief that joy was mine! 
Flow’rs now bloom upon her grave.

3. 
Now my heart with grief is riven, 
Hopeless pass life’s sands away; 
But the bliss to know in heaven, 
I shall meet sweet Minnie Gray.
