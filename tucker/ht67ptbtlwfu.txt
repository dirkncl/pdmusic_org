1.
We need not go to Fairy land,
Nor study fairy lore,
To learn what wond'rous deeds were done
By Giant men of yore,
'Tis earnest effort brings success,
Then wherefore idly stand,
When ev'ry door will open wide,
If entrance you demand.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
"Pull the bobbin the latch will fly up."
"Pull the bobbin the latch will fly up."
Don't think of the bitter that's now in you cup,
But "Pull the bobbin the latch will fly up,"

2.
The wolf who gave such shrewd advice,
To little "Riding Hood,"
Too well for honest country folks.
This maxim understand.
And we a rule to guide your life,
A mortal, too, may catch,
For sure the bobbin we must pull,
If we would raise the latch!

3.
What e'er ambition may propose,
'Tis yours, if you but seek,
To win the battle:-- life proclaims
No vict'ry to the weak.
Should any door your progress bar,
Don't think you've met your 'match,
Until the bobbin you have pull'd
For that may raise the latch!
