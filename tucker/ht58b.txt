1. Stand by the flag its folds have stream'd in Glory
To foes a fear to friends a festal robe
And spread in rhythmic lines the sacred story
Of Freedom's triumphs over all the globe
Stand by the flag on land and ocean billow
By it your father there stood unmoved and true
Living defended dying, from their pillow
with their last blessing passed it on to you.

2. Stand by the flag though death shots round it rattle
And underneath its waving folds dawn met.
In all the dread array of sanguine battle
The quiv'ring lance and glitt'ring bayonet
Stand by the flag all doubt and treason scorning
Believe with courage firm and faith sublime
That it will float until th'eternal morning
pales into glories all the lights of time.
