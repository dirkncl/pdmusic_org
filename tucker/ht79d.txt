"On the Wild, Wide Mississipi" (1879)
Words by Colonel Arthur T. Lee, USA
Music by Henry Tucker
from "Clover Blossoms" (#3)

1.
On the wild, wide Mississippi,
The moon is shining down,
And her lustre gilds the ripple,
As we float by yonder town.
I am dreaming but 'tis folly,
I am hoping but 'tis vain,
Whilst a thousand miles between us lie,
Of forest, wave, and plain,
Whilst a thousand miles between us lie,
Of forest, wave, and plain.

2.
Like the moon upon the water,
Mem'ry lights my spirit here.
Like the voice of sight, her whisper
Falls in sweetness on my ear;
But the stream is dark before me,
And I cannot cast my eyes,
On the shadow of my future,
That before me darkly lies,
On the shadow of my future,
That before me darkly lies.

3.
As o'er the stream and valley,
Floats the rosy breath of June,
Peace woos me to her bosom,
But my heart is out of tune;
For I feel beneath the starlight,
Whilst my eyes are weeping rain,
That beneath the stars of Heaven,
We shall never meet again,
That beneath the stars of Heaven,
We shall never meet again.
