"Away With Gloomy Thoughts To-day" (1867)
Words and Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

[Source: pp. 57-59 from "Nine O'Clock in the Morning"]

1. 
Away with gloomy thoughts today, the sun is shining bright, 
And in its beams, like summer birds we’ll ever take delight, 
With music and with mirthfullness we’ll pass the hours away, 
Till twilight shadows curtain in the glory of the day. 
Then spend the time to jocund song, and let our voices ring, 
For peace and love control the heart and brighten ev’ry thing.

FULL CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Away with gloomy thoughts today, 
No shadow can they fling, 
Hurrah! for peace and love control the heart 
And brightness ev’ry thing.

2. 
Our tasks are done, and we may put the signs of toil away,
We’ve studied hard, and now we mean to give ourselves to play;
For only those who labor well are worthy to enjoy
The sweet reward of diligence, the bliss without alloy.
Then let us fill the air with songs, with frolic and delight,
To join us in our revelry let all and one unite.

3. 
I hear the music in the breeze of voices low and sweet,
They bid me seek, oh! haste and seek their fairylike retreat;
My heart gives answer to the call; I long, I long, to go
Where summer-birds are singing sweet, and summer roses blow.
Then say the word, and off we go so merry and so free,
The heart is like a bird that pines without its liberty.
