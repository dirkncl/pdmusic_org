"They Say I Am Nobody's Darling" (1880)
Written and Composed by Henry Tucker

1.
They say I am "nobody's darling,"
Nobody cares for me;
While others are radiant and joyful,
I'm lonely as lonely can be;
I'm lonely, indeed, without you, dear,
But I know what I know in my heart,
Dreaming at morning and evening,
Of meeting, ah, never to part.
So though I am "nobody's darling,"
Nobody cares for me,
I know what I know is in my heart, love,
As I pray for you out on the sea.

2.
They say I am "nobody's darling,"
Nobody cares for me;
But your image lies deep in my heart, love,
As I pray for you out on the sea;
Oh, last night I stood by the gate, love,
When Charlie and Annie went by,
Looking so happy, joyful,
I turned and went in with a sigh.
So though I am "nobody's darling,"
Nobody cares for me,
I know what I said in my heart, love,
As I pray for you out on the sea.
