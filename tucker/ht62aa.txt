1.
Oh! blessings forever on Aggie Asthore,
  She's good and she's lovely, and twenty time more,
With here sparkling blue eyes and her eloquent smile;
  Oh! the hearts of the hardest, 'tis she can bequile,

REFRAIN
Aggie dear.
Oh! blessings forever on her I adore,
For she's good and she's lovely, my Aggie Asthore.

2.
Oh! the first time I saw her was at the village fair
  And the prettiest girls in the country were there,
But none did I see either then or before,
  That at all could compare with my Aggie Asthore.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Oh! she's kind and she's lovely, she's honest and true,
  And what is far better, a winning love too;
How I long for the day, with the ring on the fore--
  When forever she's mine my sweet Aggie Asthore.

(REFRAIN)
