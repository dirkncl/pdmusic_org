"Jennie is Waiting for Me" (ca.1855)
Words by George B. Pennock
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
The sun is fast hiding its beautiful face,
The moon will soon leap in the sky,
And sweet little stars will be soon peeping down,
To remind me the hour is nigh;
When I must meet Jennie that dear little maid,
In the door that looks out on the sea,
And oh I must not linger here very long,
For Jennie is waiting for me.

CHORUS
Bright little fairy, dear little Jennie,
Living alone by the sea.
I'll soon be beside you, sweet little bird,
For I know you are waiting for me.

2.
The moon is now peeping out over the hill,
To lighten the pathway for me.
Oh, I'll soon be with you my sweet little maid,
I can hear the deep roar of the sea;
Meet me to night, darling, with bright sunny smiles,
And a laugh that is joyous and free,
I see you, my own darling, there in the door,
My Jennie is waiting for me.

(CHORUS)
