1. Did you ever go in to an Irishman’s shanty?
Ah! there boys you’ll find the whiskey so plenty 
With a pipe in his mouth there sits Paddy so free.
No King in his palace is prouder than he.
Hurrah! my honey, 
[Now then boys, one for Paddy!] 
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!

2. There’s a three legged stool and a table to match,
And the door to the shanty is locked with a latch;
There’s a nice feather mattress all bursting with straw,
For the want of a Bedstool, it lies on the floor.
Hurrah! my honey.
[Now then boys, one for the mattress.]
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.

3. There’s a neat little Bureau without paint or gilt,
Made of boards that was left when the shanty was built,
And a three cornered mirror that hangs on the wall,
But divil a picture’s been in a at all.
Hurrah! my honey.
[Now then boys, one for the picture.]
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.

4. He has three rooms in one;
Kitchen, bedroom and hall,
And his chest, it is there, wooden pegs on the wall,
He’s two suits of old clothes, ’tis a wardrobe complete,
One to wear in the shanty, the same in the street.
Hurah! my honey.
[Now then boys, one for the old clothes.]
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.

5. He’s a pig in the sty, and a cow in the stable,
And feeds them on scraps, that’s left from the table,
They get sick if confined, so they roam at their ease,
And go into the shanty whenever they please.
Hurah! my honey.
[Now then boys, one for the pig.]
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.

6. There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys,
Who attends to the shanty, the girls and the boys;
The brats he thinks more of, than gold that’s refined,
But Biddy’s the jewel that’s set in his mind.
Hurah! my honey.
[Now then boys, one for Biddy.]
Whack! Paddy’s the boy.
