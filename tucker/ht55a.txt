"Come Maiden With Me" (1855)
Serenade of the Corsair.
Sung by Mr. John Farrenberg
[Written and?] Composed by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
Come maiden with me o'er the silvery sea,
My bark is impatiently waiting for thee,
The bright stars are smiling to see thee appear,
And the light waves are dancing to welcome thee here;
Cool zephyrs are wooing thy ringlets to come,
And wanton with them on our own ocean home,
Where the sea bird shall wake thee when danger is near,
And their gambols shall teach thee to laugh at thy fear.
Ah ...

REFRAIN
Come maiden with me o'er the silvery sea,
My bark is impatiently waiting for thee,
The bright stars are smiling to see thee appear,
And the light waves are dancing to welcome thee here.

2.
My bark is as swift as the wind, when the deep
And wild leaping ocean waves rock us to sleep,
And stout as the billow she stems in here pride,
To hear thee afar on its bosom my bride;
Her anchor's aweigh for the far coral groves,
Where the mermaidens sing of their sports and their loves,
Then linger not here on this dull shore alone,
For its haunts are unfit for thee beautiful one.
Ah ...

(REFRAIN)
