"The Old Folks and the Home So Dear" (1882)
Words by Francis J. Cutting
Music by Henry Tucker, 1832-1882
(His Last Composition.)

1.
There are times when mem'ry wanders far back to the days of yore,
To the Homestead and the old folks, there my thoughts so often soar,
But of all fond recollections of scenes both far and near,
They that best recall my childhood, my heart will hold most dear,
For in those days dear father would by the fire bright
Tell stories to us children the long, long winter night,
Thrilling tales of how in youth he had join'd that hero band,
Who had left their plows and peaceful homes
To fight for father Land.

CHORUS
Bright recollections of the days of old
Steal o'er me, as I wander thro' this world so drear and cold,
But brightest of them all are those, that ever bring more near
The Old Folks and the old home so dear.

2.
Mother, she would entertain a neighbor or a pleasant guest,
And would read to us the bible, ere we went to gentle rest;
But came time with many changes--they're laid beneath the soil,
Freeing them from care forever, and all their weary toil!
Oh still they come before me as in the days of old,
And in my heart their mem'ries do yet retain their hold;
As I struggle on in life, as I breast its stormy sea,
Oh, their faces shining thro' the past,
My beacon light shall be.

(CHORUS)
