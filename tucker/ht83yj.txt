1.
I met her by the trickling brook,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
As fair as morn her gentle look,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
'Twas golden bright her falling hair;
A sparkling sunbeam nestled there,
And free from sorrow, free from care
  Was young Jenny, fond Jenny.

CHORUS
Oh! her step was like a fawn, so fleet! so fleet!
And her eyes, like early dawn, so sweet! so sweet!
Oh! her step was like a fawn, so fleet! so fleet!
And her eyes, like early dawn, so sweet! so sweet!

2.
When first the sky-lark peals his song,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
Through the meadows bounds along,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
There's not a bird but knows her tread,
The linnet meek, the robin red,
Will chirp and flutter o'er the head
  Of young Jenny, fond Jenny.

(CHORUS)

3.
I met her, but I know not why,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
My foolish heart did nought but sigh,
  Young Jenny, fond Jenny;
Until at length our eyes they met,
And soft confess's without regret,
That all my hopes were fondly set
  On young Jenny, fond Jenny.

(CHORUS)
