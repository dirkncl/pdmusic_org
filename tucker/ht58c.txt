"Star of the Morning" (1858)
Poetry by F. G. Russell
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Star of the evening beautiful star,
Rest from thy journey bright world afar;
Wise men of old were guided by thee,
Herald of joy mayst thou ever be ...
Herald of joy mayst thou ever be.

CHORUS 'mp'
Beautiful star! (Beautiful star!)
Beautiful star! (Beautiful star!)
Star! star of the morning, morning!
Beautiful, beautiful star!

(CHORUS 'pp')

2.
Lone in thy glory trembling star,
Tell us thy mission what joys there are;
Something of life seems moving thee now,
Beings of glory radiant as thou ...
Beings of glory radiant as thou.

(CHORUS 'mp')
(CHOURS 'pp')

3.
Goddess of Beauty dasling star,
Tipping with silver the sky gates afar;
Like a lost diamond gleams through the blue,
Cloudlets where sunlight is glimmering too ...
Cloudlets where sunlight is glimmering too.

(CHORUS 'mp')
(CHOURS 'pp')
