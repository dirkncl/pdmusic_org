'Tis Evening Brings My Heart to Thee (1868)
====================================
Words by Miss Francis Jane Crosby
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
'Tis evening brings my heart to thee,
  When all is lovely, calm, and still;
That welcome hour, so dear to me,
  When purest thoughts my bosom fill!
The bird flies homeward to its nest,
  The zephyr woos the wand'ring bee,
The dewdrop seeks the lily's breast,
  So evening brings my heart to thee.

CODA
To thee! to thee!
'Tis evening brings my heart to thee.

2.
A truant beam returns again
  To mingle with the orb of day;
A streamlet, winding through the glen,
  Will love itself in ocean spray;
And when the sky with beauty glows,
  And stary, eyes look on the sea,
When weary nature seeks repose,
  Then evening brings my heart to thee.

[Repeat CODA]

3.
Oh! I could linger at the side,
  And dream away every care;
Or fancy life a silver tide,
  With not a wave in riple there:
Though fortune frown and coldly spurn,
  And mine a chequered path must be,
Till mem'ry's lamp shall cease to burn,
  Will evening bring my heart to thee.

[Repeat CODA]
