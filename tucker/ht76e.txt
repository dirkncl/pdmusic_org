"The Mill-Wheel Is Frozen in the Stream" (1876)
Christmas-Tide a Hundred Years Ago.
Song for Baritone or Mezzo Soprano.
Transcribed from an old English song
by Henry Tucker.

1.
The mill-wheel's frozen in the stream,
The church is decked with holly,
The mistletoe hangs on the kitchen beam,
To fright away melancholy.
Icicles chink in the millmaid's pail,
The youngsters skate on the pond below.
The blackbirds perch on the garden rail,
But hark! how the words do blow.

REFRAIN/CHORUS
The mill-wheel's frozen in the stream,
The church is decked with holly,
The mistletoe hangs on the garden wall,
To fright away melancholy.

2.
There goes the "Squire" to shoot at snipe,
"Dick" runs to fetch a log,
You'll say his breath was the smoke of a pipe,
In the early morning fog.
"Hodge" is breaking the ice for the kine,
Old and young rough as they go,
The round red man ne'er sinks or slides,
But hark! how the words do blow.

(REFRAIN/CHORUS)
