"Softly and Low" (1879)
Valedictory.
Three part Chorus for Female
VOICES.
from "Trios"[#8]
by Henry Tucker

1.
Softly and low,
As streamlets flow,
Our sad notes faintly swell;
The heaving breast, that may not rest,
Breathes forth; "Farewell, farewell!"
As o'er the deep the lone birds sweep,
And on its white foam dwell;
O'er life's dark sea, on, on, we flee;
Lov'd ones, farewell, farewell!

2.
The lonely heart
Must widely part
From those that it loves so well.
But mem-ry's gleam shall light life's dream,
Dear friends farewell, farewell!
And in you skies, where ne'er shall rise,
The fearful parting knell;
Life's fever past, we'll meet at last,
Sisters, farewell, farewell!
