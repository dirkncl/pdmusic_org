1.
I am lonely, so lonely by the sea side!
How faded the tint of the soft summer skies;
My heart too is sinking as low as the tide,
And tears, bitter tears now are blinding my eyes;
How bright the waves whisper as they kiss the shore,
Like lips full of music I'll hear nevermore,
Like lips full of music I'll hear nevermore.

CHORUS
On the soft wings of love she was borne far above,
To dwell with the angels for ever,
And the queen of my soul I shall no more behold
With these fond eyes,
While living, no, never.

2.
How beauteous the flowers that bloom by the way!
They woo me from sorrow to sweet dreams of love;
And sweet is the songbird that carols its lay,
And points my poor sad drooping spirit above;
But those blissful moments alas they have flown,
Those treasures, those pleasures I once call'd my own,
Those treasures, those pleasures I once call'd my own.

(CHORUS)
