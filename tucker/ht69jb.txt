1. Joy-bells ringing,
Children singing,
Fill the air with music sweet;
Jocund measure,
Guileless pleasure,
Make the chain of song complete. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Joy-bells! Joy-bells!
Never, never cease your ringing;
List, list, the song that swells,
Joy-bells! Joy-bells!
Children! children!
Never, never cease your singing;

2. Joy-bells ringing,
Children singing,
Hark! their voices, loud and clear;
Breaking o’er us,
Like a chorus,
From a purer, happier sphere.

3. Earth seems briighter,
Hearts grow lighter,
As the jocund melody
Charms our sadness
Into gladness,
Pealing, pealing, joyfully.

4. Joy-bells nearer
Sound, and clearer,
When the heart is free from care;
Skies are cheering,
And we’re hearing
Joy-bells ringing everywhere.
