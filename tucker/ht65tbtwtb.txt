1. 
The warlike clouds are rolled away
And peace with angel hand
Has opened while the prison door
Throughout the Southern land,
Our noble vet’rans, scarred and brown,
Have fought their battles thro’,
And now we meet on ev’ry street
The “boys that wear the blue.”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then let a glorious shout go up
For gallant hearts and true,
For lads we meet on ev’ry street
“The boys that wear the blue,”
For lads we meet on ev’ry street
“The boys that wear the blue.”

2. 
Whene’er we see a soldier brave,
We long his hand to grasp,
And hold it till we make him feel
Our heart thrill with the clasp,
To let him know a nation’s pride
In all the gallant crew,
That manned our good old ship of state,
The boys that wear the blue!

3. 
Thus shall it be in years to come,
When age comes on apace,
The heroes of our battle fields
Shall have the foremost place;
The stars and stripes shall shelter those,
Who brought it nobly through;
And all their scars a glory be,
The boys that wear the blue!
