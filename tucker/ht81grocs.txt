"God Reigns! Our Country's Safe" (30 Sep. 1881)
Song
Words and Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

On receiving news of the death, by assignation, of President
Lincoln, (April 15, 1865), Mr Garfield, then a Congressman,
said: "God reigns, and the Government of Washington still lives."

1.
When cruel war swept o'er the land,
And filed our hearts and homes with woe;
When treason with a ruthless hand
Had laid our Lincoln low;
In prayer and tears we sought the throne
Of Him who answered to our faith,
Each loyal heart was moved to own;
"God reigns! Our blessed country's safe!"
  Each loyal heart was moved to own;
  "God reigns! Our blessed country's safe!"


2.
"God reigns! the government is safe!"
So said the stricken, suff'ring one;
A man! the people's chosen chief,
(The mur-derous work was done.)
But strong in goodness, truth and right;
The pat-riot statesman's christian faith,
Cried out, triumphant! in its might:
"God reigns! the government is safe!"
  Cried out, triumphant! in its might:
  "God reigns! the government is safe!"


3.
When doubt or danger weighing down
Our hearts, and courage growing dim;
When frightened hope has well nigh flown,
Then all eyes turn to Him
Who rules all things on sea and land.
In love and mercy for man's faith,
He holds the nations in His hand;
"God reigns! the government is safe!"
  He holds the nations in His hand;
  "God reigns! the government is safe!"
