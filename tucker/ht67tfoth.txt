When the village bells are pealing,
Thro' the fragrance of the moon,
I walk across the meadows
By the waving fields of corn,
There beside the sparkling river dancing onward to the see,
The Fairy of the Hudson, Darling Fairy comes to me.

CHORUS
Oh, my fairy, bright eyed fairy,
My heart beats alone for thee, love,
And I know no other music half so sweet as can be,
Dear fairy of the Hudson, Darling one, I love but thee.
