To Miss Mina C. Richie, Brooklyn, N.Y.
"Adah Moline" (18 April 1881)
Song and Chorus
by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
O, have you seen Adah, sweet Adah Moline?
Her step as light as the fawn,
Her eyes were as bright as the moonbeams at night,
That creep o'er the em'rald lawn.
Have you heard the song of her guileless heart
Floating out on the morning air?
Or listen'd entranc'd to the innocent words
Low breath'd in her evening prayer?
And oh, have you smil'd at her winning ways,
As you held, with a strange delight,
Her fairylike form and her dainty hand,
Like a snowdrop round and white.

CHORUS
Sweet Adah Moline! (Sweet Adah Moline!)
Dear Adah Moline! (Dear Adah Moline!)
The sweetest and fairest ever was seen!
Sweet Adah, dear Adah Moline.

2.
She lieth alone in her chamber now,
The neighbors all say "she is dead;"
And dear little ones have been bringing all day,
Fresh flow'rs to garland her bed;
But it's ah! ah! me, for the folded hands,
And the poor little pale little breast,
For of all bright blossoms in all bright lands,
Oh! she was the brightest and best.
And my heart is hungry, that knows too well
What mournfullest miseries mean,
Is hungry and hopeless and heavy with sighs,
For the little lost Aday Moline.

(CHORUS)
