1.
I am not angry with you, dearest,
The passing cloud of care is gone;
The smiles you love will beam more brightly,
Since ev'ry pang of grief has flown!
I thought of days and hopes departed,
That know me in their youthful glow;--
When round my played the gentle-hearted,
Whose songs were like the brooklet's flow!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I am not angry with you, dearest,
Your love is still the same to me!
My words of joy shall fall around you,
In love's delightful melody (-lightful melody).

2.
I am not angry with you, dearest,
My heart still throbs the same for you;
O, every tender word I utter,
Shall speak my love as fond and true!
The summer birds may leave the meadow,
The summer flow'rs may fade and die;
But O, my heart, in sun and shadow,
Will breathe for you its latest sign.
