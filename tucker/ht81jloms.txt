Solo--with Quartet ad lib.
Sacred Music
By Henry Tucker, 1826-1882
[Words? adapted from Charles Wesley, 1707-1788]

1.
Jesus, Lover of my soul!
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the billows near me roll
And the tempest still is nigh;
Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh, receive my soul at last.

QUARTET
Jesus, Lover of my soul!
Let me to thy bosom fly
While the billows near me roll
And the tempest still is nigh;
Hide me, O my Saviour hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh, receive my soul at last.

2.
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on thee;
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me;
All my trust on thee is stayed,
All my help thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of thy wing.

(QUARTET)
