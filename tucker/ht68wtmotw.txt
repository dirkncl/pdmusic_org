1.
Write to me over the water,
Write a few lines to me,
Open thy heart's deep casket,
Where only I shall see;
And show me the lights and the shadows,
The joys and the hopes and fears,
Which have lain hid from the sunlight
Many and many long years.

CHORUS
Write to me over the water,
(Write to me over the water,)
Over the water to me,
Open the heart's deep casket,
Where only I shall see.

2.
Write me over the water;
Write me over the sea.
Whether 'tis sad or joyous,
Write very soon to me;
But oh, do not close the fond pages,
And this little thing forget,
For all my waiting and longing:
Write that you love me yet.

(CHORUS)
