"There Are No Stars Burning" (1879)
Words by Arthur T. Lee, USA
Music by Henry Tucker
from "Clover Blossoms" (#2)

1.
There are no stars burning,
There are no stars burning,
There are no stars burning
As the night creeps on;
Will there be a light returning,
Will there be a light returning,
Will there be a light returning,
When the night has gone?

REFRAIN
There are no stars burning,
There are no stars burning,
There are no stars burning
As the night creeps on.

2.
God help me in my sorrow
Give me light of joy tomorrow
Bring me hope I cannot borrow
Whilst the night creeps on.
In the grave my heart is lying
Icy winds o'er it sighing
Wailing dying dying dying
And there comes no dawn.

(REFRAIN)

3.
I am weary, I am weary,
Gone the days that once were cheery
All is dreary, dreary, dreary
As the night creeps on;
Will my heart never cease its aching
Will there come no glad awaking
Will there come no daylight breaking
Will there come no dawn?
