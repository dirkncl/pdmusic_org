Words and Melody by James M. Sayles.
[DUETT from "The Dulciana. A Collection of Favorite Duetts." 1883]
Harmonized and arranged by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
Beautiful star in Heaven so bright,
Softly falls thy silv'ry light,
As thou movest from earth afar,
Star of the evening, Beautiful star.
Star of the evening, Beautiful star.

CHORUS
Beautiful star, (Beautiful star,)
Beautiful star, (beautiful star,)
Star of the eve-ning
Beautiful, beautiful star.

2.
In fancy eye's thou seem'st to say,
Come, come with me from earth away,
Upwards thy spirit's pinions try,
To realms of peace beyond the sky,
To realms of peace beyond the sky.

3.
Shine on oh! star of love divine,
May our soul's affections twine A
Around thee, as thou mov'st afar,
Star of the twilight, Beautiful star,
Star of the twilight, Beautiful star.
