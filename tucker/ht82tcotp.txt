"The Children of the Poor" (20 March 1882)
Words by Francis S. Smith
Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
We see them all around us as we go upon the street,
The pangs of cold and hunger they endure
Their clothes are all in tatters, and all bare their little feet;
Oh, who will help the children of the poor?
With no one to advise them, and not a friend to guide,
Temptations without number to allure,
With crime and vice familiar thus they float upon the tide;
Oh, who will help the children of the poor?

CHORUS
Our Master loved the children, and claimed them for His own;
And would you drive the lost ones from your door?
How can you, when you meet Him, such a grievous fault atone?
Then help the suff'ring children of the poor.

2.
Remember, you rich darlings, while you rest in slumber sweet,
From ev'ry ill and ev'ry want secure
A thousand and tiny sufferers are freezing in the street;
Oh, help the dying children of the poor?
You'll never miss the giving, and when you're called away
The Lover of these little ones to see,
How great will be your rapture when you hear him sweetly say,
"Well done, thou good and faithful! come to me."

(CHORUS)
