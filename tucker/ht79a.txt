1.
Bright be our parting, where brightly we've met;
Voices of music are echoing yet;
Tones that we love to hear,
Swell on the list'ning ear,
Hark! now in accents clear,
Singing, good night.
Good night, good night, and joy surround you,
Good night, good night.
The ling'ring tone that mem'ry loves,
Thro' your dreams in peace be stealing,
All its joys in light revealing.
Thro' each field where fancy roves,
Good night, a warm good night.
Thro' each field where fancy roves,
Good night, a warm good night.

CHORUS
Good night, good night, and joy surround you.
Good night, good night,
The ling'ring tone that mem'ry loves,
Good night, good night.

2.
Bright speed the moments of parting with you,
Hours that enjoyment has tinged as they flew;
Bright as still waters lie,
When each fair star on high,
Bends from the quiet sky,
Looking, good night.
Good night, good night, brief be our parting,
Good night, good night.
The ech-oing fall of music's strains,
Breath around her sweetest numbers,
Thro' your soft and gentle slumbers;
Till in peace we meet again,
Good night, once more, good night.
Till in peach we meet again,
Good night, once more, good night.

CODA
Good night, good night, good night.
