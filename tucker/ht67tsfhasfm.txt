1.
That sweet face has a smile for me,
The dearest treasure I possess;
For well I know that heart will be
The boon my brightest hopes to bless,
In all my checker'd pathway here,
That smile will beam for me alone,
Like lovelight, shining bright and clear,
From one I fondly call my own,
  Like lovelight, shining bright and clear,
  From one I fondly call my own.

2.
That sweet face has a smile for me,
In happiness and love it glows,
Like stars of hope upon the sea,
The sea of life's serene repose,
The storm may toss my fragile barque,
And clouds obscure the tranquil air,
Yet, thro' the storm and clouds so dark,
That sweet face still a smile will wear,
  Yet, thro' the storm and clouds so dark,
  That sweet face still a smile will wear.

3.
That sweet face has a smile for me,
Reflected from a loving heart;
A spirit happy, light, and free;
A soul of purity apart,
And, as my heart's affections twine,
More close for thee each passing year,
May that mild, beaming face of thine,
Ne'er know a shadow or a tear,
  May that mild, beaming face of thine,
  Ne'er know a shadow or a tear.
