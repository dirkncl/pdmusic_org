1.
O! it’s once more I meet you, my darling,
And I press the dear lips that I love,
And your voice sweeter far than the starling
Whispers fondly “O nevermore rove.”
I have sighed for you days, love, and days, love,
But O! sweet is the bliss that I feel,
While I look in the fair sunny rays, love,
Of your eyes darling Nora O’Neal!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! no more you’ll be lonely without me,
For I’ve answered your sad heart’s appeal;
Never more, never more need you doubt me,
You’re my own darling Nora O’Neal.

2.
O! my heart has been ever your own, love,
And it’s lonely I’ve been o’er the sea;
But my dreams they were of you alone, love,
And your face was a bright star to me.
O! it’s oft when I’ve wandered sadhearted,
A tear down my cheek, love, would steal,
As I thought of the day when I parted
From my own darling Nora O’Neal!

3.
But “goodbye” to the Past and its sorrow,
For the future I never shall fear;
O! there’s gladness in store for the morrow,
While I know that my Nora is near.
At the neat little chapel they’ll name us,
O! speak what your dear eyes reveal!
For there’s none loves you better than Shamus,
You’re my own darling Nora O’Neal!
