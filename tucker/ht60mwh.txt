1.
My Mary comes it is the hour
She promised to be here.
Taught by love's strange mysterious power
I know that she is near.
I hear the melody she sings
Beneath our happy dome
And now the woodland clearly rings
With Mary's "welcome home"
  And now the woodland clearly rings
  With Mary's "welcome home."

2.
Mary's voice I hear it thrill
In raptures on the gale
As she comes tripping down the hill
To meet me in the vale.
In all the world on land or sea
Where e'er I chance to roam
No music is so sweet to me
As Mary's "welcome home"
  No music is so sweet to me
  As Mary's "wecome home."
