To Mrs. Frank L. Swan,
Syracuse, New York.
"Thy Gentle Eyes" (1871)
Song and Chorus
Words by Miss Emily Pitt,
Music by Henry Tucker.

1.
O turn on my thy gentle eyes,
No treasure half so rare
Could all the space of jewelled mine
Or ocean's cavern hear;
Thy soul shines from their liquid deep
Like stars of summer night,
That on the heav'nly ramparts keep
Their watching fires burning bright.

CHORUS
Thy gentle eyes, thy gentle eyes
More blue than southern skies
Or flow'rs that mock the violet rare,
Oh! turn on me those eyes!

2.
Oh! orbs that mock the violets blue,
What wealth of love is thine!
What love can read thy story true
Or make thy passion mine,
Then turn on me one tender glance,
'Tis all I dare to crave,
And though another claim thy heart,
My own shall be thy slave.

(CHORUS)
