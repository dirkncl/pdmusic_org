To R. M. Hooley Esq.
"Our Color Guard" (1864)
Battle Song & Chorus
Words by Thomas J. Diehl Esq.
Composed for Mr. C. G. Lockwood
By Henry Tucker

I.
Now onward! onward! let it wave,
  Amid the cannon't roar,
Home by the noble and the brave,
  Thro' streams of crimson goar;
Amid the battle's fiercest strife,
  There ever let it be,
And guard it with devoted life,
  That standard of the free!

CHORUS
(Hip, hip!) Hurrah boys! (Hip hip!) Hurrah boys!
Hurrah! (Hurrah!) Hurrah! (Hurrah!) Hurrah!!
Onward! onward ever be --
"Our color guard"! supplied.

II.
"Stand by those colors!" many an eye
  Is looking up today,
To see that glorious emblems fly
  Where danger checks the way.
"Stand by those colors!" many a soul
  Will gain new strength to die,
If in the red tides fiercest roll
  Those colors proudly fly.

(CHORUS)

III.
Oh! color guard! Oh, noble, brave,
  How one by one they fall,
But not their fate! nor yet the grave
  Our brave lads can appal.
Now from the ranks leap eagerly,
  Like groom to meet his bride
A score of volunteers -- and see!!
  "Our color guard" supplied.

(CHORUS)
