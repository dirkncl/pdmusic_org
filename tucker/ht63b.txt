"Dear Mother, I've Come Home to Die" (1863)
Words by E. Bowers
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Dear Mother, I remember well
  The parting kiss you gave to me,
When merry rang the village bell --
  My heart was full of joy and glee;
I did not dream that one short year
  Would crash the hopes that soar'd on high!
Oh, Mother, dear, draw near to me,
  Dear Mother, I've come home to die.

Chorus
Call Sister -- Brother -- to my side,
And take your soldier's last goodbye;
Oh, Mother, dear, draw near to me,
Dear Mother, I've come home to die.

2.
Hark! Mother, 'tis the village bell,
  I can no longer with thee stay;
My Country calls to Arms, to Arms!
  The foe advance in fierce array!
The vision's past -- I feel that now
  For Country I can only sigh,
Oh, Mother dear, draw near to me,
  Dear Mother, I've come home to die.

Repeat Chorus

3.
Dear Mother, Sister, Brother, all
  One parting kiss, -- to all good bye;
Weep not, but clasp your hand in mine,
  And let me like a soldier die!
I've met the foe upon the field
  Where kindred fiercely did defy,
I fought for Right -- God bless the Flag!
  Dear Mother, I've come home to die.

Repeat Chorus
