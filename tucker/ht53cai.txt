"Cleon and I" (1853)
Words from the New York Observer
Music by Henry Tucker, 1826-1882

1.
Cleon hath a million acres,
  Ne'er a one have I --
Cleon dwelleth in a palace,
  In a cottage I --
Cleon hath a dozen fortunes --
  Not a penny I --
But the poorer of the twain
  Is Cleon, and not I.

2.
Cleon, true possesseth acres,
  But the landscape I;
Half the charms to me it yieldeth
  Money cannot buy.
Cleon harbors sloth and dullness,
  Fresh'ning vigor I,
He in velvet, I in fustian,
  Richer man am I.

3.
Cleon is a slave to grandeur,
  Free as thought am I;
Cleon fees a score of doctors
  Need of none have I.
Wealth surrounded -- care environed --
  Cleon fears to die,
Death may come, he'll find me ready,
  Happier man am I.

4.
Cleon sees no charm in nature,
  In a daisy I;
Cleon hears no anthem ringing
  In the sea and sky:
Nature sings to me forever!
  Earnest list'ner I --
State for state -- with all attendance,
  Who would change? Not I.
