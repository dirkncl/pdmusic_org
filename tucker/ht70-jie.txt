[PAGE 1]
[Israelitish:]
[Religioso Moderato]
["Prayer". Unison.]
Lord at thy feet we kneel
Hear thou each heart's appeal
Thy love to all reveal
Grant us my blessing

Bless Thou our lands increase
Give us thy Heav'nly peace
All earthly pain will cease
Thy love possessing.

[PAGE 2]
["Morning Chorus"]
[Allegretto Moderato]
In the land of our fathers our tents are upreared,
By the faith of our fathers our homes are endeared.
Oh! how sweet to each heart are the plains we have trod
They are blessed by the smile and the promise of God.
Lo! the sun in its [PAGE 3] glory has brought us the day
And it calls us to labor away, lets away
And it calls us to labor away, lets away, lets away.
Lets away. Let's away, away.

[Note: They are supposed to separate while singing,
going in different directions.]

[PAGE 4]
[A Father's love.]
[Moderato e Cantabile]
[Cantabile]
A Father's love so holy
How dear unto the heart while life shall lost
its mem'ry will never more depart,
'Twil blossom through thy future years
where-ever thou shalt go
'Twill make thy pathway
[PAGE 5] bright and fair
A Heav'n on earth below.
[Repeat {sung at presentation of coat of many colors}]

[Joseph's Dream "Flushed in Sleep"]
[Moderato e tempre legato.]
[Coro]
Flushed in sleep the dreamer see
Lo! the sheaves on dewey lea
Waving in the golden morn.
Visions [PAGE 6] fair to him are borne,
Wrapp'd in slumbers calm and deep.
How the future wakes in sleep
Painting all the hopes to be,
Youths delightful prophecy;
Sleep on, Sleep on, Sleep on.
[Tableau]

[PAGE 7]
["Behold the dreamer cometh"]
[Solo]
[Moderato]
[Vigoroso]
Behold the dreamer cometh now
Our brother let us slay
Some evil beast hath him devoured
This can we tell straightway
Thrown in the dark and [PAGE 8] noi'some pit,
where fall no cheerful gleams,
Then shall we see what will become
Of all his wondrous dream.

[PAGE 9]
[He is sold to the Ishmaelites.]
["Peace to the sad heart"]
[Duo & Chorus for Tenors & Altos]
[Moderato sempre legato]
[Duo con expressione]
Far from the home and the land of his birth
[PAGE 10] Far from the Father mourns him in vain
Wandring a stranger an outcast on earth
Peace to the sad heart o'er whelmed with its pain.
[Coda Piano - Peace -- pp. -- Peace]
[Tableau "And all his sons and daughters
rose up to comfort him."]

[PAGE 11]
[Chorus. Tenors & Altos]
Far from the home and the land of his birth.
Far from the Father who mourns him in vain,
Wandring a stranger an outcast on earth
Peace to the sad heart o'er whelmed with its pain
[Coda] Peace, Peace.

[PAGE 11 1/2]
[Shemar Yisrael]
["Dinah's Song"]
How shall I comfort Thee
Oh! my Father
How shall I comfort Thee.
Lo! at my feet behold thy daughter kneeling
How shall I comfort thee.
The stars above will shine
The sun arise tomorrow
Alas there is no joy for thee
no comfort in thy sorrow.

[Thy sons and daughters, thy children's children
How shall they comfort thee,
Joseph, Alas! is not. Heaven hath bereft thee
How shall we comfort thee.
                  Shemar Yisrael.]

[PAGE 12]
["Egyptian"]
[Scene: Egyptian Prison.]
[Sentence -- Interpretation of Dream.]
[Jospeh:] Wherefore look ye so sad today?

["Chief Rutler's Dream"]]
[Moderato.]
In my dream behold a vine
Three brnaches budded there.
On these [PAGE 13] branches there were
grapes that clustered ripe and fair.
Pharoh's cup was in my hand
I pressed the golden grapes there in
and the cup to him I [PAGE 14] gave
His Kingly grace to win.

----
["Joseph's Interpretation]
[Solo: Jospeh.]
(Joseph.) "Three days are the branches
Three, And ere three days shall [PAGE 15] wane
Pharaoh shall give unto thee
thy former place thy place again.
[PAGE 14]
[simultaneous with Solo]
(Semi-chorus. Female voices.)
With tinkling bells and cymbals bright
we praise our King we chant his might
ye people all his triumph sing
Thrice honored be our [PAGE 15] mighty King
Thrice honored be our mighty King
Thrice honored be our mighty King.
----

[Solo -- Chief Raker]
In my dream three baskets were
With baked meats filled was one,
And the birds did eat there--
of beneath the golden sun.
[PAGE 16]
Round the basket on my head
they gai'ly flattered till I woke
And I wondered at my dream
while morning o're us broke.

[Note: if desired the words of the above Solo, as well
as the interpretation following may be
printed directly over the music of the
Chief Rutler's Dream and its interpretation
on pages 11, 12 & part of 13.]

[Joseph (accompaniment by semi-chorus same as
in former interpretation)]
[Interpretation of Dream of Chief Raker]
Three days are the basquets three
And are three days thou hast
Pharoah will demand Thy

[PAGE 17]
head and birds on thee on thee repast.

[Note: In accompanying these two "Interpretations"
the _semi-chorus_ _must_ be kept to _piano_ that it not
only does not interfere with Joesph's Solo, but shall seem
as it were passing the Prison, or in some way _afar_ _off_ --
Let none but Trebles and Altos sing in it, in this place;
_Solo, bold and vigorous like a Prophet_.]
[Tableau]

[Full Chorus -- "Hail to our King."]
Hail to our King
With voices gladly blending
Our grateful tributes a-
[PAGE 18]
-gain we bring His Name,
his Name in triumph now we sound
His praise be heard the world around.

[Semi-Chorus]
With tinkling bells and cymbals bright
we praise our Kingwe chant his might
ye people all his triumph sing
Thrice honored be our mighty King
Thrice honored be our mighty King
Thrice honored be our mighty [PAGE 19] King.

[Pharoa's Dream]
[Moderato]
[Solo]
[Solo]
I stood by the river in my dream
The light of the morning shining [PAGE 20] fair
The waves in their pure and silv'ry gleam
Made music unto the golden air
And Lo! came a vision to mine eyes
And twice are the morning light it fell
now troubles from slumber I arise
Oh! who may my interpret well.

[PAGE 21]
["Interpretation of Pharoah's Dream"]
[Joseph]
[Grazia]
Lo o're the land shall plenty shine,
And harests ripen in thy fields
Thy peasants dance beneath the laden vine
And bless the land that increase [PAGE 22] yields
Then Famine like a giant bold
shall stalk above each blighted plain
And misery with grief untold
shall fall till seven years shall wane.

[PAGE 23]
[Recitiation]
[Pharoah]
Thou shall be ruler over my house.

["Proudly Arrayed"]
[Semi-Chorus]
[Allegretto]
Proudly arrayed as a King in the land
a peer of the wise and the great.
Lifted in joy from his lowly estate
A ruler exalted and grand

[PAGE 24]
[Full Chorus]
Behold him all gleaming in purple and gold
E'n so shall the lowly arise
All honor unto him and praises untold
Re-echo his name to the skies.
Re-echo his name to the skies.

[Repeat "Hail to our King"]

[Recitative]
[Joseph]
Whence come ye? ye are spies,
to see the nakedness,
to see the nakedness of the land ye come.

From Canaan's land we came,
No, spies are we believe us [-]
[PAGE 26]

our land is dead with famine
each field's a dreary waste
we would back to our Father
and younger brother haste.

[PAGE 25]
[2nd.] Oh bid us not to bring him
Our Father's joy and pride
With tears we now beseech thee [-]
[PAGE 26]
let him home abide,
our Father's heart with sorrow
Would bow if he were gone.
Oh tear not from his bosom
This precious one his own.

[PAGE 27]
[Chorus in men's voices]
We come for food believe us,
oh turn us not away,
We pray thee not unburdened
Send us from home today
We pray thee not unburdened
Send us from home today.

[Recitative ad libit.]
By the life of Pharoah
Ye shall not go forth hence
Untill your younger brother come hither.

[PAGE 28]
[Tableau]
[Behold the Cup]
[Chorus for Tenors & Altos]
Behold the cup of silver bright
what means its presence here,
Once to the heart it brought delight
now brings it wond'ring fear
Our father's blessing and his pride
must stay in Egypts land
And severed now we must abide
The King's supreme command
Once to the heart it brought delight
Behold the [PAGE 29] cup of silver bright.

[Jacob & sons come to Jospeh in Egypt --
Here repeat chorus "Hail to our King"
& "with tinkling bells."]

[Egytian Chorus of Welcome.]
[Joyously.]
With welcome songs rejoice, rejoice glad welcomes
Echo ev'ry voice
The stranger guest within our gates
For ev'ry joy upon him waits
The son unto his [PAGE 30] own restore glad welcomes
Sing forevermore glad welcomes
Sing forevermore, glad welcomes
Sing forevermore.

[Finale]
["Jehovah reigns."]
[Israelitsh Chorus]
[Da Capo] Jehovah reigns all Kings above
Jehovah's praise we sing with love

||: Jehovah reigneth o'er his people
Still he reigneth o'er his people
Still he reigneth, still he reigneth
Lord for ever more.
