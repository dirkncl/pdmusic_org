1. What battle’s music greets our ear,
Our guns are sighted on the foe;
Then serve the arm and banish fear,
And comrades, touch the elbow.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Touch the elbow now my boys,
Lively comrades, touch the elbow,
Nerve the arm and banish fear,
And comrades touch the elbow.

2. For Home and Country, Patriots fire,
Kindle our hearts with fervid glow,
And every foeman must retire,
When Freemen touch the elbow.

3. Tho’ many brave men bite the sod,
And crimson hearts blood freely flow;
Shout, as our spirit soars above;—
On, comrades! touch the elbow.

4. Though cannon ball may plow the rank,
And through it cast a deadly glow;
Fill up the space the ball made blank,
And comrades, touch the elbow!

5. Now show the stuff of which you’re made,
The general signal, “March,” Hallo!
Double the Quickstep, Third Brigade,—
Charge! comrades, touch the elbow!
