CHORUS1
We praise thee, we bless thee! 
Thou who only art divine; 
No name is worthy such homage as thine; 
Our heart's adoration forever we will gladly bring 
To thee, our Redeemer, Creator and King. 
SEMI-CHORUS
1. 
To meet the glad echoes our voices will roll; 
The song of the lip is the praise of the soul; 
CHORUS2
We praise thee, we bless thee! 
Thou who only are divine, 
For no name is worthy such homage as thine.

O God, in thy power  er, 
Control us this hour 
And  fill all our heart's with love, 
Singing praises to thee. 

[CHORUS1]
SEMI-CHORUS
2. 
For mercies unnumber'd, for tenderest care, 
For blessings thy children so bounteously share;

Thy care is abiding, 
And in thee confiding, 
We know thou wilt gently lead 
To our dear home above.

[CHORUS1]
SEMI-CHORUS

For all the sweet promises faithfully given, 
For all the bright hopes that look forward to heaven;

O Thou watching o'er us, 
Renew and restore us, 
And raise us above despair, 
Fill us ever with joy.

[CHORUS1]
SEMI-CHORUS
4. 
Our voices, in chorus, exultingly rise, 
To join with the angels whose songs fill the skies. 
[CHORUS2]
SOLO
O list to our singing, 
Our voices are ringing, 
In tones that are sweeter far 
Than the angels above.

CODA
We praise thee, we bless thee, 
Thou who only art divine, 
No name is worthy such homage as thine; 
Our heart's adoration for ever we will gladly bring 
To thee, our Redeemer, Creator, and King. 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen. 
Hallelujah, Amen, Amen.
