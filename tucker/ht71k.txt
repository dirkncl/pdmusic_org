"The Little Old Woman" (1871)
(Comic Song for 2 Part Chorus for Female Voices)
Words by George Cooper
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
I've just had a talk with my "dolly"
She's only one year and I'm ten;
I told her 'twas quite melancholy
Those ways of the rising young men!
They seem to care only for "Fashion,"
No matter wherever they go;
And all of them have quite a passion
To put on the airs of a "beau!"

REFRAIN
Ah! really this world is so funny!
The fact I am sure none denies;
But young people will be young people!
I wonder when they will grow wise!

2.
The girls are of course no exception,
'Tis shameful the way they go on!
I'm in quite a state of dejection
To hear of their follies alone!
It's nothing but "parties" and "candies"
And other extravagant ways!
And everything gay in demand is,
They never consider who pays!

(REFRAIN)

3.
Ah! wait till they get little older,
And here you'll allow me to state,
That young folk have grown so much bolder,
And "children" are quite out of date!
Their "fashions" and "di-does" amuse me,
They soon will be turning my head;
But there's "dolly" crying! excuse me,
I'll just go and put her to bed!

(REFRAIN)
