1. Our Uncle Sam has acres broad for every man to till,
Or work enough for all to do, who labor with a will;
Though people crowd and jostle him, and rudely push and jam,
“The more that comes the merrier,” says good old Unlce Sam.

FULL CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Our Uncle Sam, has sent a telegram
To every land and state;
For all the world to emigrate,
Hurrah! for Uncle Sam.

2. Mynheer may come and bring his frow, and all his children too,
And Uncle Sam will make his bow, and give him work to do;
He will even taste his saurkrout, and over look his flaws,
Till Hans shall think this happy land the best that “never war.”

3. And Pat may come, and Bridget too, and all their little brood,
And join with ready hand and heart, our union brotherhood;
The Englishman, the Hollaner, the Frenchman and the Scot,
“Come all the world,” says Uncle Sam, “and earn a house and lot.”

4. The boys and girls are growing up, and all the world may see,
Beneath the glorious shadow of the tree of Liberty;
When quietly reposing, rests the Lion and the Lamb,
And all the peace and harmony is due to Uncle Sam.
