"When Starry Eyes Look on the Sea" (1877)
Song
Written and Composed
by
Henry Tucker

1.
When starry eyes look on the sea,
My weary spirit longs for thee;
Alas, that I afar must rove
From thee, my queen, my life, my love.
Alas, that I afar must rove
From thee, my queen, my life, my love.

When wild winds howling, wake the deep,
Or when old ocean's lulled in sleep,
Thy spirit lingers ever near,
To soothe and bless and calm each fear.

REFRAIN
Oh! queen, my love!
Oh! love, my queen!
When starry eyes look on the sea,
My weary spirit longs for thee,
Alas, that I afar must rove,
From thee, my queen, my life, my love.
Alas, that I afar must rove,
From thee, my queen, my life, my love.

2.
O loyal heart, to love so true,
O spirit pure as Heaven's own blue,
Live till I meet thee on the shore
Where pain and parting are no more.
Live till I meet thee on the shore
Where pain and parting are no more.

Though storms of sorrow o'er thee roll,
In peace possess thy gentle soul,
Secure that One, all light and love,
Is guiding true hearts from above.

(REFRAIN)
