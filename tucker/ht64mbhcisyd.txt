1. 
My darling boy I little thought
When last I heard your merry tone
And fondly kissed your noble brow
That death would claim you as his own
With breaking heart I bade you go my boy
And weeping breathed a sad goodbye
You told me that you’d soon return
You have but Oh! you’ve come to die
Home to die! Home to die?
My boy! how can I see you die?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O tell me not your life is short my boy
I cannot cannot say Goodbye
Alas! why must I give you up?
My Boy! how can I see you die?

2. 
When fiercely raged the deadly strife
Throughout our fair, once peaceful land
Responding to our Country’s call
You joined a loyal gallant band
With joy and pride I gazed upon you boy
Your noble form and flashing eye
For Freedom’s cause I gave you up
But Oh! how can I see you die?
Home to die! Home to die?
My boy! How can I see you die?

3. 
You bid me now no longer weep
You say you’ll like a soldier die
How can I stay the falling tear!
Alas! How can I say Good bye?
But I will try to do the will my Boy!
Of Him who dwells above the sky
And strive to say Thy will be done
But oh! T’is hard to see you die.
Home to die! Home to die?
My boy! How can I see you die?

CODA
Home to die! Home to die!
My Boy! how can I see you die?
