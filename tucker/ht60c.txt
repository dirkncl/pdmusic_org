1.
Come hither little Fairy May,
My bride if you will be,
I'll give you silks and satins bright
Most beautiful to see;
I'll bring you to my castle hall,
'Mid lords and ladies gay;
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May.
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May!

CHORUS
Fairy May,
Quoth little Fairy May,
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May!


2.
Says mother, He's a proper youth;
Say yes, girl there's a dearie;
Say no, Miss Pride! her father cried,
I'd only like to hear ye!
But still for all that they could do,
And all that they could say
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May.
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May!

(CHORUS)

3.
Come Fairy May your words unsay,
You silly little goosie!
You know within you heart of hearts,
You wouldn't like to loose me;
You'll never see me here again,
If once I go away;
"Well sir! and much I care for that,"
Quoth little Fairy May.
"Well sir, and much I care for that,"
Quoth little Fairy May!

(CHORUS)

4.
Love such a prize! her father cries,
Say yes - or else I'll make ye!
Her mother scolds - a willful chit!
I've half a mind to shake ye!
But still for all that they could do,
And all that they could say
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May.
"No thank you sir, I'd rather not,"
Quoth little Fairy May!

(CHORUS)
