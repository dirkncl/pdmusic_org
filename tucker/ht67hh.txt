1. Happy hours too swiftly going,
Fain would we your joys prolong;
Join we then with hearts o’erflowing
In our evening parting song.
Saviour grant to us a meeting,
On the bright celestial shore,
At Thy feet each other greeting,
May we meet to part no more.

2. Saviour to our homes attend us,
Guiding us in all our ways;
From the ills of life defend us,
Help us, Lord, to show Thy praise.
Ever more Thy name adoring,
Babe of Bethlehem, Prince of Peace,
We shall join the saints triumphant,
Swell the song that ne’er will cease.
