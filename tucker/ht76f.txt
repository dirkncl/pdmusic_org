"Why Linger at the Style?" (1876)
Ballad
by Henry Tucker

1.
The keaves are growing reddy, as the sun begins to dip,
The birds are twitt'ring forth their evening song,
Little Lucy sits, expectantly with her finger at her lip,
What makes her sister Alice day so long?
What makes her sister Alice day so long?
There are butterflies and dragonflies all ready to be chased,
There are daisy chains to weave, there are blackberries to taste;
Why not play about the meadows for awhile?
Why linger, linger, linger at the stile?
Why linger, linger, linger at the stile?

2.
Impatient little Lucy is a simple witted mite,
Her sweatheart days are future joys, 'tis clear!
Why should Harry keep his are around her sister's waist so tight?
Why makes her blush by whisp'ring in her ear?
Why makes her blush by whisp'ring in her ear?
The sun will soon be setting, Lucy does not love the dark,
She does not love the silent bats, that flit across the park;
Since he met her, Alice might have walked a mile;
Why then linger, linger, linger at the stile?
Why then linger, linger, linger at the stile?

3.
This dialogue, small Lucy, which seems tedious as you tarry,
To Alice is a rather serious thing,
For it means that she and Harry have this evening vowed to marry;
It means a cake, lace veil, and wedding ring.
It means a cake, lace veil, and wedding ring;
And when a little bridesmaiden uncommonly like you,
Comes into church so trippingly, all dressed in white and blue,
You'll discover as you reach the middle aisle,
Why they linger, linger, linger at the stile?
Why they linger, linger, linger at the stile?
