1.
I am lone-ly, so lone-ly, down by the sea-side!
How fad-ed the tint of the soft sum-mer skies;
My heart, too, is sink-ing as low as the tide,
And tears, bit-ter tears now are blind-ing my eyes;
How bright the waves whis-per as they kiss the shore,
Like lips full of mu-sic I'll hear nev-er-more,
Like lips full of mu-sic, I'll hear nev-er-more. 

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
On the soft wings of love she was borne far a-bove,
To dwell with the an-gels for-ev-er,
And the queen of my soul I shall no more be-hold,
With these fond eyes, while liv-ing, no, nev-er.

2.
How beau-teous the flow-ers that bloom by the way!
They woo me from sor-row to sweet dreams of love;
And sweet is the song-bird that car-ols its lay,
And points my poor sad droop-ing spir-it a-bove;
But those bliss-ful mo-ments, a-las! they have flown,
Those treasures, those pleas-sures I once call'd my own,
Those treasures, those pleasures I once call'd my own.
