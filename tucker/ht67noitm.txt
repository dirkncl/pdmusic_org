1. 
A voice is whisp’ring unto me,
It comes with the early day;
And its tones I cannot refuse to hear,
That urge me to school away.
The golden glory that wakes the world,
With beauty the east adorning;
Has said— “why linger so long?— you know
’Tis nine o’clock in the morning!”
Has said— “why linger so long?— you know
’Tis nine o’clock in the morning.”

2. 
And out from the gardens merrily troop
The maidens so loving and fair,
And on to the trystingplace they go,
And I must be with them there.
Then hold me not with magic spell,
My better impulse scorning;
For I must be ready to join the ranks,
At nineo’clock in the morning,
For I must be ready to join the ranks,
At nineo’clock in the morning.

3. 
But why do I linger yet, loth to go,
While still on my list’ning ear,
Sweet sounds arise, and out on the air,
Ring voices, loud and clear?
And list! the belfry sends a note,
It is the final warning;
One kiss— and then I must say “goodbye,”
’Tis nineo’clock in the morning!
One kiss— and then I must say “goodbye,”
’Tis nineo’clock in the morning!
