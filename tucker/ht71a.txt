"All in the Mist of the Morning" (1871)
Ballad

Words by George Cooper
Music by Henry Tucker

1.
Blossoms and lilacs were pearly,
And sweet was the bird's early song;
Why did she wander so early,
And why did she linger so long?
Somebody came at the dawning;
The roses were sparkling with due;
All in the mist of the morning,
Bright eyes were tender and true!
All in the mist of the morning,
Bright eyes were tender and true!

2.
Sweet lips in rapture were meeting,
But no one was with them to see;
What they were softly repeating,
Is nothing to you or to me.
Eyes that were bright as the dawning,
Were drooping at love's gentle prayer;
All in the mist of the morning,
Love is abroad in the air!
All in the mist of the morning,
Love is abroad in the air!

3.
Bells o're the meadow were sounding,
And sweet were the echoes that rang;
Hearts in their joy were rebounding,
For love was the message they sang.
Cupid's awake at the dawning;
To loiter in love is a sin;
Never be "missed" in the morning,
If a sweetheart you would win!
Never be "missed" in the morning,
If a sweetheart you would win!
