1.
The wind is a bachelor merry and free,
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho ...
He roves at his pleasure o'er land and o'er sea
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho...
He ruffles the lake and he kisses the flower,
And he sleeps when he likes in a jassamine bower.
He ruffles the lake and he kisses the flower,

Oh! the wind is a bachelor merry and free
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho ...
He roves at her pleasure o'er land and o'er sea
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho ....

2.
He give to the cheek of a maiden its bloom,
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho ...
He tastes her warm kisses enjoys their perfume
Yeo ho ... Yeo ho ...
But truant-like often the sweets that he sips
Are lavished next moment on lovelier lips.
But truant-like often the sweets that he sips
Are lavished next moment on lovelier lips.
