1.
My country! 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing;
Land where my father's died,
Land of the pilgrim's pride,
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring.

CHORUS
Land where my father's died,
Land of the Pilgrim's pride,
From every mountain side
Let Freedom ring.

2.
My native country! thee,
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love;
I love the rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills:
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.

CHORUS
I love the rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills:
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.

3.
Let music swell the breeze,
And sing from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song;
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence brake,
The sound prolong.

CHORUS
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence brake,
The sound prolong.

4.
Our father's God! to thee,
Author of Liberty!
To thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by thy might,
Great God, our King!

CHORUS
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by thy might,
Great God, our King!
