1. A thousand tapers shed there light 
Through St. Mary’s holy sisters, 
And many a white rose garland blooms 
Where the Virgin Mother smiles. 

2. And there before her silver shrine 
Kneels Count Vatembra’s child, 
Her veil thrown back her blue eyes raised to that brow so fair and mild 
To that brow so fair and mild.

3. The orange wreath is round her head,
A jewelled robe she wears;
But no ring is yet on that fairy hand,
And with tears she brathes her prayers.

4. One hour more, and the perfumed air
Will be filled with bridal strain.
And her young Knight, mid the proud and brave,
Be the noblest of all their train.


5. Thay will stand where Mother’s dust lies low,
And she weeps for the love that is gone;
Oh! would she might beneath her Mother’s breast,
And hear but her faintest tone.

6. There’s a sound through the chapel, the flame
Is bent, as though a light wind passed near,
And the lady locks on her snowy arm
With a hope and a thrilling fear;

7. And her cheek turns pale, though her eye is bright,
For she sees the dark kisses there,
Of her who in life had loved her best,
And whose spirit has heard her prayer.
