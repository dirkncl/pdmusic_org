1. 
A Nigger in Alabama lived, 
	Dey used to call him Joe; 
Dis nigger lived to be so old, 
	His head was white as snow. 
Dis nigger he was very rich, 
	The poor ones liked him well, 
Dey used to go to de old man’s house 
	Some stories for to tell.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den strike de toe and heel my lass, 
Den strike de heel and toe, 
Miss Philis am a walking 
for your Alabama Joe. 

2.
This old Nigger built a church,
	A minister he hired,
Who staid with them about four years,
	Then quit ’cause he was tired;
This minister a good salarygot,
	As all these niggers know:
De money it was paid to him
	By Alabama Joe.

3.
Dis made these niggers all feel bad
	To think he served them so,
But the one the shock fell worse upon
	Was Alabama Joe.
In a few years after dis,
	De good old nigger died:
He left these niggers all he had
	And Miss Phillisy his bride.

4.
His money he did will away
	To Phillisy his spouse;
Which caused a great disturbance
	At did old nigger’s hoiuse.
Miss Phillisy had him buried
	All under an old tree;
And after dey had buried him
	Dese niggers had a spree.

5.
A Nigger in Virginny lived
	Who heard of old Joe’s death,
And straight for Alabama steered,
	And never stopped for breath;
He quick made love to Phillisy,
	Who was a charming fair;
Her eyes was bright as diamonds,
	And curly was her hair.

6.
Dis nigger he was a Fisherman,
	A Fisherman so old;
A fishing he did go one night,
	And caught a dre’full cold;
Dis nigger lived in great harmony,
	Old age did make him pine;
For she was only twenty three,
	And he was sixty nine.

7.
Dis story that I now relate,
	As a good old nigger said,
He was one morning to their house,
	And found ’dis couple dead.
Now Miss Phillisy she is dead.
	Old Joe he went before,
Dat old nigger has gone too.
	We shall see them no more.
