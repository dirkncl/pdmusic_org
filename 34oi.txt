1. Once more afloat, our gallant gallant 
Ship sweeps proudly, proudly o’er the heaving, sea 
With canvass swelling, swelling to the breeze, 
And pennons waving waving high and free 
The sparking, sparkling waves salute salute her course, 
As round her sides they briskly brickly play; 
And graceful bending, bending to the foam 
She onward, onward breasts her steady steady way, 
The sparkling waves salute salute her course 
As round her sides they briskly briskly play 
And graceful bending bending to the foam 
She onward breasts her steady steady way 
She onward breasts here steady way 
She onward breasts her steady way. 

2. Speed on! Speed on! thou noble, noble, 
Hark O’er rolling rolling billows gaily ride; 
Let cannon notes, let cancon notes proclaim, 
That thou wilt never, never be defied 
Thou oft, thou oft hast brav’d, hast brav’d the storm and battle 
And never yet hast either brav’d in vain 
And should thy foes, thy foes still dare assail thee 
We’ll show thine “Ironsides” thine “Ironsides” again 
Thou oft hast brav’d, hast brav’d the storm and battle 
And never never yet hast brav’d in vain; 
And should thy foes still dare still dare assail thee 
We’ll show, we’ll show thine Iron sides again 
We’ll show thine “Iron sides” again 
We’ll show thine “Iron sides” again.
