1. O would that she were here,
These hills and dales among,
Where vocal groves are gaily mock’d
by Echo’s airy tongue:
Where jocund Nature smiles,
In all her gay attire,
Amid deeptangled wiles
Of hawthorn and sweet brier,
[CHORUS]
O would that she were here,
That fair and gentle thing,
Whose words are musical as strains
Breath’d by the windharp’s string.
O would that she were here!
O would that she were here!

2. O would that she were here,
Where the free waters leap,
Shouting in their joyousness
Adown the rocky steep:
Where rosy zephyr lingers
All the live long day,
With health upon his pinions,
And gladness on his way.
[CHORUS]
O would that she were here,
Sure Eden’s garden plot
Did not embrace more varied charms
Than this romantic spot.
O would that she were here!
O would that she were here!

3. O would that she were here,
Where glide the pleasant hours,
Rife with the song of bee and bird,
The perfume of the flowr’s:
Where beams of peace and love,
And radiant beauty’s glow,
Are picture’d in the sky above,
And in the lake below,
[CHORUS]
O would that she were here—
The nymph of this bright scene,
With song and dance and revelry,
Would hail Bianca queen.
O would that she were here!
O would that she were here!
