1. Here upon this mountain side, 
Till now we met together; 
Here I won my woodland bride, 
In flush of summer weather; 
Green was then each friendly bough, 
This dear retreat that shaded; 
Autumn winds are round me now, 
And the leaves are faded, 
and the leaves are faded. 

2. She, whose heart was all my own, 
In this summer bower, 
With all pleasant things has flown 
Sunbeam, bird, Land flower! 
But her memory will stay, 
With me though we’re parted. 
From the scene I turn away, 
Almost broken hearted, 
almost broken hearted.
