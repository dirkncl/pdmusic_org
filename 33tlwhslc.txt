1. I own I'm in love with a spark
Who aims my fond fancy to charm
We take a sweet walk when tis dark
And tell me pray where is the harm
He dresses so neatly and smart,
As if in gay fashion he whirld,
That the hope and the pride of my heart,
Is the lad with his side locks curld
 He dresses so neatly and smart,
 As if in gay fashion he whirld,
 That the hope and the pride of my heart,
 Is the lad with his side locks curld.
 Is the lad with his side locks curld.

2. Some fix on a youth that sedate,
Who is cautious and looks so demure,
But girls ne[']er trust a trim pate,
Or he of his prudence too sure,
He will win an odd trick on the sly,
Tho by folly he never seems hurld,
So like me I'd advise you to try,
Some gay lad with his side locks curl'd,
 He will win an odd trick on the sly,
 Tho by folly he never seems hurld,
 So like me I'd advise you to try,
 Some gay lad with his side locks curl'd,
 Some gay lad with his side locks curl'd,

3. If you go to the castle to[-]night,
I'm sure you wont fail to git beaus,
For there still is frolick delight,
The ladies may find them in rows,
And a youth I observe sitting there,
Who sigh'd as his fingers he twirl'd,
But sir I'm engaged I declare,
To the lad with his side locks curl'd.
 And a youth I observe sitting there,
 Who sigh'd as his fingers he twirl'd,
 But sir I'm engaged I declare,
 To the lad with his side locks curl'd.
 To the lad with his side locks curl'd.
