The following festive song was written in 1800 at the beautiful
village of Harborn near Birmingham where the Author was on a
visit, & requested to compose some Music, to celebrate happy
May-day, ushered in with ringing bells, singing and sports,
round a May pole, with a maiden Queen chosen to preside over
the happy day.

1. On the first day of May when the village bells are ringing,
And the sound wakes a thrill of delight thro' the grove
How enchanting each scene when the birds are sweetly singing,
And the woods and groves echo their fond notes of love.
 Then let us join the vocal lay
And welcome in the festive day;
While village bells are ringing,
And all natures choir are singing,
Their fond chorus so gay
In the sweet month of May.
In life's cup of pleasure,
We'll fill up the measure,
While health crowns the banquet and sweetens the glass,
With bacchus vine,
Loves roses entwine
And impart to the seasons new charms as they pass.
Then let us join the vocal lay,
And welcome in the festive day,
While village bells are ringing,
And all nature's choir are singing
Their fond chorus so gay,
In the sweet month of May.

2. In rural delights every sportive scene enjoying
No canker of care shall our pleasures control
While health casts oblivion o'er old time as he's flying
Or freshens his wings in the mantling bowl,
When social delights makes the fireside look gay,
While music and wine
New pleasures combine
And give joys to December as cheerful as May.
Then let us join the vocal lay,
And welcome in the festive day,
While village bells are ringing
And all nature's choir are singing
Their fond chorus so gay
In the sweet month of May.
