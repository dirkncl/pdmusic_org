1. The bright flag of America,
How gallantly it waves,
Above the freeman’s dwelling  place,
Above the foeman’s graves, the foeman’s graves;
By stately streams, and forests deep,
By stately streams and forests deep
And on the bounding sea
And on the bounding sea.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
A thousand hearts are welcoming,
The banner of the free.

2. Where’er a peaceful hamlet lies,
Its sheltering hills between,
The starry beacon floats above,
As guardian of the scene,
Where the north pine forests bind, to
The tempest’s sweeping blast,
And every stone a record keeps
Of struggles of the past.

3. Where the prairies plain is spreading,
And wild warwhoops ring by,
Or by the distant water course,
Beneath a southern sky,
The stars, and stripes wave proudly out,
And from farwood to sea,
From heart, and voice, breaks forth the shout,
The banner of the free.
And from farwood to sea.
