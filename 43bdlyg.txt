1. Oh bless dat lubly yaller gal,
Dat some folks call "Miss Dinah;"
Oh pity me ye niggas all
And tell where I can find her;
Oh now she's gone and left you
For fear dat you might harm her.
Today after tomorrow,
She's gone to Alabama.

2. Her hair is like de shining silk,
She's fat and round as rorus,
She feed upon good mush and milk
And morus multirorus.
Oh now she's gone and left me,
My heart is fill'd wid sorrow.
I'll find some oder yaller gal,
An I'll marry her tomorrow.
