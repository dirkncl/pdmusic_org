1.
The moon’s bright beams illume the bow’rs 
Awake there’s no one near love 
The breeze breathes softly o’er the flow’rs 
Arise my lay to hear love 
I touch the trembling strings with joy 
Then listen to thy minstrel boy 
Come list to thy minstrel boy 
Come list to thy minstrel boy.

2.
I sing of happier hours to come
When I am blest with the love
In some sequestered rural home
Thou wilt be all to me love
I touch the trembling strings with joy
Then listen to thy minstrel boy,
Come list to thy minstrel boy
Come list to thy minstrel boy.
