([sung by] DOT)
Always it seemed the dreams I dreamed
Were in vain, in vain,
I prayed that they might come true,
Yet I knew that dreams seldom do.
Long were the hours, and writher'd the flow'rs untill
Today;
I have found somebody, somebody who will make my life blossom anew.
My day has come
My hour begun
Gone are the moments of sorrow,
Sunshine shall greet my tomorrow.
All waiting's ended,
Fate has befriended
Two hearts that true love has blended as one,
And at last my day has come!
