"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life" (21 Nov. 1910)
(The Dream Melody)
Lyric by Rida Johnson Young, 1869-1926
Music by Victor August Herbert, 1859-1924
from the operetta "Naughty Marietta"

Ah! sweet mystery of life, at last I've found thee,
Ah! I know at last the secret of it all;
All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning,
The burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall!
For 'tis love, and love alone, the world is seeking;
And 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
'Tis the answer, 'tis the end and all of living,
For it is love alone that rules for aye!
For 'tis love, and love alone, the world is seeking;
And 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
'Tis the answer, 'tis the end and all of living,
For it is love alone that rules for aye!
