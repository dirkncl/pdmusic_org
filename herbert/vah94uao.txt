Under an oak one fine June morn,
Unostentatiously was born
A babe, ordained for fickly fate,
To play with far from lightly,
To play with far from lightly.
Now thrived and grew this bane apace,
In stature high with added grace
The forest broad for his estate,
As manhood bound him tightly.

By law amontlaw termed,
The epithet I've earned,
For all who stray through paths my way must pay the toll I claim,
For all who stray through paths my way must pay the toll,
the toll I claim,
Who dares my might and power disdain?

A noble lord was asked for toll,
Who in fin equipage did roll,

Whith daughter fair as summer skies,

I kissed her hand I kissed hand politely
O tiny hand, O! cruel theft,
Of much this outlaw she befeft,
of much this outlaw she bereft.
Though untold wealth lay in her eyes,
She stole my heart, she stole my heart completely,
Ah! Ah! into a palmer[?] turned, for love this outlaw yearned,
Her heart I'll win and count no sin to worship at her shrine,
Her heart I'll win and count no sin to worship at her shrine;
And dare, and dare to call her mine.
