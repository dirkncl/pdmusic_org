1. You know the yarn of Puss-in-Boots,
Of Jack who climbed the beanstalk shoots,
Of Orpheus, who charmes the brutes,
All popular fairy tales.
There are Bopeep and Red Riding Hood,
Likewise the Babies of the Wood,
And Jack who 'gainst the giant stood,
All favorite fairy tales.

Fairy tales, fairy tales, we hear them ev'ry day,
List! for a while, with pitying smile,
Then wink, and walk away.

Pharoah's fair daughter said she found
Moses in the pond half-drowned.

Fairy tales, fairy tales
'Tis only a fairy tale.

2. A girl's complexion fair, you guess,
Is all her own. Well, more or less,
It "comes and goes"? In hoxes, yes.
'Tis only a fairy tale.
A dark girl says she will be fair
If you hint "bleached"-- she says "You dare!"
She'll fib, and "never turn a hair,"
It's only a fairy tale.

Fairy tales, fairy tales, we hear them ev'ry day,
List! for a while, with pitying smile,
Then wink, and walk away.

Whene'er a lady, fair and fat,
Says "Peroxide! what is that?"

Fairy tales, fairy tales
'Tis only a fairy tale.
