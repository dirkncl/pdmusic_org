"Gypsy Love Song" (1898)
(Slumber on, my little gypsy sweetheart.)
Words by Harry B. Smith, 1860-1936
Music by Victor August Herbert, 1859-1924
from "The Fortune Teller", Comic Opera in 3 Acts

1.
The birds of the forest are calling for thee
And the shades and the glades are lonely;
Summer is there with her blossoms fair,
And you are absent only.
No bird that nests in the greenwood tree
But sighs to greet you and kiss you,
All the violets yearn, yearn for your safe return,
But most of all I miss you.

CHORUS
Slumber on my little gypsy sweetheart,
Dream of the field and the grove,
Can you hear me, hear me in that dreamland
Where your fancies rove?
Slumber on, my little gypsy sweetheart,
Wild little woodland dove,
Can you hear the song that tells you
All my heart's true love?

2.
The fawn that you tamed has a look in its eyes
That doth say "We are too long parted;"
Songs that are trolled by our comrades old
Are not now as they were light hearted.
The wild rose fades in the leafy shades
Its ghost will find you and haunt,
All the friends say come, come to your woodland home,
And most of all I want you.

(CHORUS)
