1.
From his lair in the mountains at night
When the moon's behind a cloud,
The bandit comes and raids the town,
And ev'ry peasant is cowed.
He carries off girls and he steals the sheep,
And naught but the devil can match you.
And the crone that hushes the child to sleep,
Says "Hush or the Bandit will catch you.
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
The terrible bandit will catch you.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
But we'll catch you at last, Tivolini,
We'll soon have you fast, Tinolini,
We'll hang you, don't fear,
We'll end your career.
Your doom you shall hear, Tivolini.
We'll catch you at last, Tivolini.
We'll soon have you fast, Tinolini,
We'll hang you, don't fear.
We'll end your career.
Your doom you shall hear, Tivolini.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Soon you'll be fast.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Tivolini.

2.
He is King of the mountains at night
And he lurks in lair all day,
And woe to him who on yon heights
Must travel his dang'rous way.
All's quiet he thinks as he rides along,
But soon he discovers his error,
When a knife or bullet ends life of song,
'Tis he, Tivolini, the terror.
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
'Tis he Tivolini the terror.
