"Toyland" (1903)
Words by Glen MacDonough, 1870-1924
Music by Victor August Herbert 1859-1924
(from "Babes in Toyland")

1.
When you've grown up dears
And are as old as I,
You'll often ponder on the years
That roll on swiftly by
My dears, that roll so swiftly by
And of the many lands
You will have journeyed through
You'll oft recall
The best of all
The land your childhood knew!
Your childhood knew.

CHORUS
Toyland! Toyland!
Litle girl and boyland,
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy then
Childhood's Joyland
Mystic merry Toyland!
Once you pass its borders
you can ne'er return again.

2.
When you've grown up dears
There comes a dreary day
When 'mid the locks of black appears
The first pale gleam of gray
My dears, the first pale gleam of gray,
Then of the past you'll dream
As grey haired grown ups do
And seek once more
It's phantom shore
The land your childhood knew!
Your childhood knew.

(CHORUS)
