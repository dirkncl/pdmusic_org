"A Kiss in the Dark" (1922)
Words by B. G. DeSylva
Music by Victor August Herbert, 1859-1924
from the operetta "Orange Blossoms"

I recall the mad delight
Of a lovely dance,
And a stroll into a night,
Trembling with romance.
There he told me of my charms,
How could I resist?
Suddenly within his arms
I was held and kissed!

REFRAIN [sung twice]
Oh, that Kiss in the dark
Was to him just a lark,
But to me ’twas a thrill supreme!
Just a kiss in the dark
But it kindled the spark,
The awak’ning of love’s young dream!
