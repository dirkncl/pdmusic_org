[1.] Beware of the hawk, my baby,
Beware of the hawk, my child!
It flies in wide, wide circles
And turns upon the wing,
Too quick for the eye to follow;
Beware! Beware! Beware!

[2.] Lie down in the nest, my baby,
Lie down in the nect, my child;
The willowbough will hide you
And rock you in its arms;
So sleep until tomorrow:
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
