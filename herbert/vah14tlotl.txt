[Philip]
My fair bride that is to be
Is perfection, I agree,
Cold perfection, chisled marble, nothing more.
[Elaine]
What do I hear?
[Philip]
And her heart is like a pearl,
She's a goddess, not a girl,
Well, the polar regions others may explore!
[Elaine]
Is he sincere?
[Philip]
If you clasped her frigid charms
For a moment in you arms,
You would find the artic angel would not thaw.
[Elaine]
Indeed, indeed!
[Philip]
Just imagine now your feelings
When she answers your appealings
With an epigram from Chesterton or Shaw!
[Elaine]
I understand.
[Philip] (with enthusiasm)
Give me the girl of temp'rament,
Not one of snow and ice!
[Larry]
The sort of girl whose heart's for rent
To one who pays the price!
[Philip]
'Tis plain that you have ne'er loved one,
So cannot understand.
[Larry]
Perhaps you're right, I've just begun,
You must take me in hand
Just girls, I see, will never, never do.
[Philip]
That's very, very true!
[Elaine]
We'll never, never do!
[Larry]
For they are very much too slow.
[Philip]
Well, I think so!
[Elaine]
And you should know!
[Philip]
Give me the love of the Lorelei,
Love that none can deny.
Inconstant though as the moon above,

[overlapping voices]
[Philip]
Still while it lasts, it's love, true love!
[Elaine]
And so you call that love!

[Philip]
Give me the eyes where enchantment

[overlapping voices]
[Philip]
lies,
Tempting smiles, longing sighs!
The fond caress
Of a lingering glance,
There you will find romance.
[Elaine]
Lies and lies!
Lies and lies!
In the fond, the fond caress
Of a lingering glance,
You find romance.
