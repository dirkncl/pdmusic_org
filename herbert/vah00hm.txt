1.
In thy garden fair, with blossoms blooming,
Roses fill the air with their perfuming.
By the trysting tree,
You know it well, dear,
Lone I wait for thee, my love to tell, dear.
Hear me.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Hear me, Madonna mia.
In my singing
All my soul to thee is upward winging,
Thou art my one idea
And by night and day my dream alway.

2.
Ah, it cannot be thou art forgetting,
Drifting far from me, with me regretting.
Is it in thy mind
That we must part, love?
Nay, thou are too kind to break my heart, love.
Hear me.

3.
If it is your care we drift away so,
It is only fair that you should say so.
Therefore, speak thy mind,
If we must part, dear,
So that I may find a new sweetheart, dear.
Hear me.
