1.
I seem to have known you my whole life long.
Yet only today I found you --
Your were the soul in ev'ry song,
All beauty has gather'd around you,
You have been to the worship of distant days,
As a star in the dusk above you,
And I knew when we met in the worlds high ways,
At last that I shoul love you

CHORUS
In dreamland, dreamland I've look'd into your eyes,
And felt this unknown love
To be a far off paradise.
In dreamland my darling, your voice was low and sweet.
Ere years were past I knew at last,
That you and I should meet.

2.
For you I have waited thro all the years
That linger'd our lives to sever,
Waited for you in hopes and fears,
But now you are mine, dear, forever.
Now the world is to me as a Summer day
And the skies are more fair above me.
All my life is a song to the words you say,
When you tell me you love me - you love me

(CHORUS)
