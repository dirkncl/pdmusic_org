1.
He's a lad from County Claze,
'Tis the wild ones comes from there;
An' be sure 'tis in his coat a rogue you'll see.
O'er the girls he casts a spell,
Oh, I know that very well,
(For bechune us from that spell I am not free?)
There's no colleen in the land
Could his iliquince withstand,
Should he spake to her as he has spoke to me!

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
"Me heart have ye stole, yuze the theif of the soul,
Me sinses y have taken too.
Both fair Trojan Helen an' Vayous excellin'
They'd ne'er bold a rush light to you.
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
Sure one kiss would be no sin,
For I love you, Alanna,
Your slave is poor Barney O' Flynn?"

2.
'Tis no rest or peace I know,
An' I often bid him go,
For to one I'm sure he never could be true.
But he answers "Ah, mavrone
Faith 'tis you I love alone,
Wid your tresses all of gold and eyes so blue!"
Thin before he laves me door
I've forgiven him once more,
For wid blarney such as his what can I do!
