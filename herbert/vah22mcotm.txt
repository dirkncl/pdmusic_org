1.
The picture of Mary was in my heart
When I sailed over the sea.
It filled me with sorrow that we should part'
For she was Ireland to me.
Sure I know what it is to be lonesome,
No sweetheart and far from home.

Refrain [sung after each verse]
I dreamed of Mary and Ireland,
And in my fond dreams, I could see
Her eyes like the blue skies of old Country Clare,
With her cheeks like the roses that bloom in Kildare.
Sad were the days of my yearning,
Today though, my heart's full of glee;
My dreams of old Ireland, at last, have come true,
For Mary came over to me.

2.
The lark and the mavis forgot their song
When Mary bid them goodbye;
Each lad and colleen wept the whole night long
And stars grew dim in the sky.
Ev'ry true Irish heart loves my Mary,
But none love her more than I.
