1. Do you remember, Angeline,
That heartless "Human Snake"
Who won my heart in an other part
And gave that heart a break?
I'll sing you now of my sweet revenge,
'Twas retributiojn stern;
She fell in love with a tattooed man
Who broke her heart in turn. Ah!

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
He was a human picture gallery
Such a spectatular gent;
He won her heart, and drew her salary,
He never gave her a cent;
Till one good day with her season's pay
And the Fat Lady off he ran,
Oh, 'tis perfectly true
You can beat a tattoo,
But you can't beat a tattooed man!

2. He had designs upon himself,
She had designs on him;
She loved to look at the picture-book
He had on ev'ry limb
"Oh, why should I go abroad? she said,
To Germany, France, or Rome;
With a lovel collection awaiting inspection
In my happy, little home. Ah!

3. He'd Raphael's Cherubs on his brow,
The Angelus on his chest,
While on his back was a lib'ral stack
Of "old Maters" of the best
"Oh, picture yourself, she said,
A lovelorn maiden's doom;
"I cannot picture to myself,"
He said-- for there's no more room." Ah!
