[Fanchette, Nanette, Mde. Cecile]
There's a proverb that is triute, but true,
[Fanchette]
It describes it neatly,
[Nanette]
fully and completely.
[Fanchette, Nanette, Mde. Cecile]
Tells us what a lot of girls will do
When the one in charge of them is not in view.
[Fanchette]
Now we'll tell you that the wise men say,
[Nanette]
When the cat's away, then the mice will play.
[Fanchette and Nanette]
We don't like to think of mice like that,
[Mde. Cecile]
I don't like to think that I'm the cat.
[Fanchette, Nanette, Mde. Cecile]
But though there are a few perhaps, who doubt it, flout it,
Others find it true from day to day.
[Mde. Cecile]
from day to day
[Fanchette, Nanette, Mde. Cecile]
And often those who do not bear in mind that, find that
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
  When the cat's away, the mice will play.
