1.
Once more I crave to let me tell thee
How precious dear, thou art to me,
This life would seem to me so lovely
If thou should'st ne'er remember me,
if thou should'st ne'er remember me.

CHORUS (repeat twice after each verse)
Ah! love me
Ah! love me
World's a dreary place
without this blessing of thy grace.

2.
Should'st thou refuse the hand I offer
The love I've borne thee strong and true,
Ah! if thy heart could never love me
Then mine would die, but still I woo,
Then mine would die but still I woo.

3.
Into thy hands my fate I've given
My sorrow and my happiness
O grant me bliss! on earth a heaven
Give me thy love my life to bless!
Give me thy love my life to bless!
