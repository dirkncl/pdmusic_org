(THE GONDOLIER)
When the twinkling stars are coming
in the purple afterglow,
And the soft guitars are strumming
Gondoliers are humming low
I am longing and I'm yearning,
For a boat that's out to sea.
Fondest memories are burning
And I'm calling tenderly.

Bring back my beautiful love boat
That drifts on the blue lagoon,
Like clouds in heaven above float
And kissed by the silvery moon
My boat with beauty is laden
One only one love I see,
Bring back my beautiful maiden,
My love boat come back to me.
