1.
I've often heard it said ob late,
Dat Souf Ca'lina was de state,
Whar handsome nigga's bound to shine,
Like Dandy Jim of Caroline,

CHORUS
For my ole massa tole me,
I'm de best looking nigga in de county oh,
I look in de glass, as I found it so,
Just as massa tell me, oh.

2.
I drest myself from top to toe,
And down to Dinah I did go,
Wid pantaloons strapped down behind,
Like Dandy Jim of Caroline,

(CHORUS)

3.
De bull dog cleared me out ob de yard,
I taught I'd better leabe my card,
I tied it fast to a piece ob twine,
Signed "Dandy Jim of Caroline."

(CHORUS)

4.
She got my card, an wrote me a letter,
And ebery word she spelt de better,
For ebery word and ebery line,
Was Dandy Jim of Caroline.

(CHORUS)

5.
Oh, beauty is but skin deep,
But wid Miss Dinah none compete;
She changed her name from lubly Dine,
To Mrs. Dandy Jim of Caroline.

(CHORUS)

6.
An ebery little nig she had,
Was de berry image ob de dad,
Dar heels stick out three feet behind,
Like Dandy Jim of Caroline.

(CHORUS)

7.
I took dem all to church one day,
An hab dem christen'd widout delay,
De preacher christen'd eight or nine,
Young Dandy Jims of Caroline.

(CHORUS)

8.
An when de preacher took his text,
He seemed to be berry much perplexed,
For nothing cum across his mind,
But Dandy Jim of Caroline.

(CHORUS)
