1. A jolly old sow once liv’d in a sty, 
And three little piggies has she, 
And she waddled about saying “Umph! umph! umph!” 
While the little ones said “Wee! wee!” 
	And she waddled about, saying “Umph! umph! umph!” 
	While the little ones said “Wee! wee!”

2. “My dear little brothers,” said one of the brats, 
“My dear little piggies,” said he; 
“Let us all for the future say Umph! umph! umph! 
’Tis so childish to say Wee! wee!” 
	“Let us all for the future say Umph! umph! umph! 
	’Tis so childish to say Wee! wee!”

3. The three little pigs grew skinny and lean, 
And lean they might very well be; 
For somehow they couldn’t say “Umph! umph! umph!” 
And they wouldn’t say “Wee! wee! wee!” 
	For somehow they couldn’t say “Umph! umph! umph!” 
	And they wouldn’t say “Wee! wee! wee!”

4. So after a time these little pigs died,
They all died of felo de se;
From trying too hard to say “Umph! umph! umph!”
When they only could say “Wee! wee!”
	From trying too hard to say “Umph! umph! umph!”
	When they only could say “Wee! wee!”

5. A moral there is to this little song,
A moral that’s easy to see;
Don’t try when you’re young to say “Umph! umph! umph!¨
For you only can say “Wee! wee!”
	Don’t try when you’re young to say “Umph! umph! umph!¨
	For you only can say “Wee! wee!”
