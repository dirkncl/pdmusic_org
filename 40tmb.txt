1. “Look here” said Rose “with laughing eyes”
Within this box, by magic hid,
A tuneful Sprite imprison’d lies
Who sings to me whene’er he’s bid.
Though roving once his voice and wing,
He’ll now lie still the whole day long;
Till thus I touch the magic spring
Then hark, how sweet and blithe his song,
Then hark, how sweet and blithe his song.

2. “Ah Rose,” I cried, “the Poet’s lay
Must ne’er ev’n beauty’s slave become;
Through earth and air his song may stray,
If all the while his heart’s at home.
And though in freedom’s air he dwell,
Nor bond nor chain his spirit knows,
Touch but the spring thou know’st so well.
And hark how sweet the love song flows,
And hark how sweet the love song flows."

3. Thus pleaded I for freedom’s right;
But, ah, when Beauty takes the field,
And wise men seek defence in flight,
The doom of poets is to yield
No more my heart th’enchantress braves,
I’m now in Beauty’s prison hid;
The Sprite and I are fellow slaves,
And I, too, sing whene’er I’m bid,
And I, too sing whene’er I’m bid.
