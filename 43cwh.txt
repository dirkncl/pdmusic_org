1.
From yonder dark Cabin what niggers advance,
De fust one de tambourine pounding;
De moon bright shinning de niggers all dance,
And loud de shrill banjo is sounding,
And loud de shrill banjo is sounding,
(And if you as what you dar behole)
Who dar!

[CHORUS]
It am de hunt ob Cudjo dat nigger so bold,
It am de hunt ob Cudjo dat nigger so bold.

2.
Dum niggeres for sartain art gwan for [de?] fight
See dar! dat big nigger dere frashing,
Dey squash his big head, and dey serve him right,
And Cudjo his Banjo is smashing,
And Cudjo his Banjo is smashing.
(And if you are as what you dar behole)
Who dar!

(CHORUS)
