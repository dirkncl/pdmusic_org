"Katy Bell" (1863)
Song & Chorus
Written by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Going down the shady dell
  Where the honeysuckles grow
I met lovely Katy Bell
  With her dimpled cheeks aglow
Oh! the beauties of her face,
  As she flitted by apace,
With a step of fairy grace,
  My poor words can never tell.

CHORUS
Katy Bell lives in the dell,
How I love her none can tell.

2.
All the flowers in the dell
  Seem'd to own her for their queen
Bright and peerless Katy Bell
  Fairer flow'r was never seen
How I loved the very ground,
  Over which she'd lightly bound,
With her sunny ringlets crown'd,
  I can never never tell.

(CHORUS)

3.
Long I waited in the dell,
  Where the honeysuckles grow,
Waited for sweet Katy Bell,
  Till the sun was sinking low.
And before I left her side,
  In the quiet eventide
I had won her for my bride,
  Won my bonny Katy Bell.

(CHORUS)
