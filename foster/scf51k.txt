"My Hopes Have Departed Forever" (1851)
Words by James Gates Percival
Music by Stephen Collins Foster

1.
My hopes have departed forever,
My vision of true love is o'er;
My heart shall awaken, ah! never;
There's joy for my bosom no more.
The roses that crowned me are blighted,
The garland I cherished is dead,
The faith once confidingly plighted
Is broke, and my loved one has fled.
The faith once confidingly plighted
Is broke, and my loved one has fled.

2.
They saw that my life was decaying,
They know that my stay would be brief;
And still, though my spirit was straying,
I told not a word of my grief.
No whisper revealed my deceiver,
No one heard my sigh or complain;
My heart still adored its bereaver,
And longed but to meet him again.
My heart still adored its bereaver,
And longed but to meet him again.
