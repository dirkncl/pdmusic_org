"Poor Drooping Maiden" (1860)
Song
Poetry & Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Poor drooping maiden maiden sighing on a bright bright summer's day
Alone in sorrow all day long,
Thine eyes from light, thine ears from song;
Why are thy frail hands toiling the hours away?
Found in a dreary home,
Round to a weary doom
Why are thy frail hands toiling the hours away?

CHORUS
Poor drooping maiden sighing on a bright summer's day,
Poor drooping maided sighing on a bright summer's day.

2.
Poor drooping maided sighing on a bright summer's day
The birds are out with songs and glee
And gladness lurks in bush and tree
Where is thy pure voice that once was so light and gay?
Come roam the laughing hills!
Come see the dancing rills!
Where is thy pure voice that once was so light and gay?

(CHORUS)

3.
Poor drooping maided sighing on a bright summer's day
The flowers are out upon the lea
And balmy winds are on the sea
Come let thy sad heart warm in the sun's kind ray!
See how the reapers toil,
Gaily they've tiller the soil,
Come let thy sad heart warm in the sun's kind ray!
