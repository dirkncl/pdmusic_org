To Mrs. A. L. Robinson
"Willie My Brave" (1851)
Ballad
Written and Composed
(Poetry and Music)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
On the lonely sea-beat shore
A maiden fair was weeping,
Calling one who far away
Beneath the wave was sleeping.
Thus her sad unchanging strain
Floated ever on the main --
Come o'er the billow,
Ride on the wave,
Come while the wind bloweth,
Willie my brave!

2.
He said his bark would soon return,
And with a kiss they parted;
But when a year had passed away,
She then grew weary hearted
Oh! 'twas sad, from day to day,
To hear the maiden's plaintive lay --
Come o'er the billow,
Ride on the wave,
Come while the wind bloweth,
Willie my brave!

3.
Nome who knew the maiden's grief,
And saw her heart's devotion
Would tell her of the fragil bark
That sank beneath the ocean;
But when all hope had passed away,
Her life breathed forth its parting lay --
Come o'er the billow,
Ride on the wave,
Come while the wind bloweth,
Willie my brave!
