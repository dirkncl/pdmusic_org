"My Angel Boy" (1858)
Words by H. Brougham
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
My angel boy, thou'rt nearing fast
  The end of thy brief race;
Already death's dark wing hath cast
  Its shadow o'er thy face.
Must thy ethereal spirit seek
  So soon its native sky?
Still paler grows thy beauteous cheek--
  I cannot se thee die,
My angel boy, my angel boy,
  I cannot see thee die.

2.
Thou, only tie that binds my soul
  To earth and bids me live,
Thou, only thought that comfort now
  Or furture hope can give,
Thou, sole pride of my widowed heart,
  Thou joy-beam to mine eye,
Ah' must thou from thy mother part?
  I cannot see thee die,
My angel boy, my angel boy,
  I cannot see thee die.

3.
I meekly bow before thy throne,
  Oh! God, nor dare repine;
For thou has but recalled thine own,
  He is no longer mine.
Oh! if it be thy gracious will,
  We soon shall meet on high,
For me there's hope, there's comfort still: --
  Thy spirit cannot die,
My angel boy, my angel boy,
  Thy spirit cannot die.
