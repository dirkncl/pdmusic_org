1. I will extol thee, Lord on high;
At thy command diseases fly;
Who, but a God, can speak and save
From the dark borders of the grave.

2. Sing to the Lord, ye saints, and prove
How large his grace, how kind his love;
Let all your powers rejoice, and trace
The wondrous records of his grace.

3. His anger but a moment stays;
His love is life and length of days;
Tho’ grief and tears the night employ,
The morning star restores the joy.
