"Oh! Susanna" (1848)
as sung by McTichner of the Sable Harmonists.
Written and Composed
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I come from Alabama
  With my Banjo on my knee--
I's g'wine to Lou'siana,
  My true lub for to see,
It rain'd all night de day I left,
  De wedder it was dry;
The sun so hot I froze to def--
  Susanna, dont you cry.

CHORUS
Oh! Susanna, do not cry for me,
I come from Alabama,
Wid my Banjo on my knee.

2.
I jumped aboard the telegraph
  And trabbled down de ribber,
De lectrick fluid magnified,
  And kill'd five hundred Nigga.
De bulgine bust and de hoss ran off,
  I really thought I'd die;
I shut my eyes to hold my bref--
  Susanna, dont you cry.

(CHORUS)

3.
I had a dream de udder night,
  When ebry ting was still;
I thought I saw Susanna dear,
  A coming down de hill;
De buckwheat cake was in her mouf,
  De tear was in her eye,
I says, I'se coming from de souf,--
  Susanna, dont you cry.

(CHORUS)

[This verse was omitted in the _original_ version.]
4.
Oh! when I gets to New Orleans
  I'll look all round and round,
And when I find Susanna
  I'll fall right on de ground;
But if I do not find her,
  Dis darkey'l surely die,
And when I'm dead and buried,
  Susanna, don't you cry.
