"There Is a Land of Love" (1863)
Words by Mrs. Mary Ann Kidder
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864
Arranged by Professor Cull

1.
There is a land of love,
  Where the pure and the holy rest,
Far in the realms above,
  In joy and gladness ever drest;
A land of beauty and delight,
  Where the streets are paved with gold;
Where celestial flow'rs are blooming fair and bright,
  And all is glorious to behold.

CHORUS
There is a land of love,
  Over on Canaan's shore;
There the soul in Christ may sweetly rest,
  And never, never leave it more.

2.
There is a land of love,
  On the shores of the cystal sea;
There may the spirit rove,
  From earthly trials ever free;
A land where tears are wiped away;
  Where the blind their God behold,
Where the lame may walk along the heavenly way,
  And the bondman ne'er again be sold!

3.
There is a land of love
  Where the soul of the ransomed sings;
There may the weary dove
  From earthly wanderings fold her wings;
A land of truth and glory bright,
  Where the pangs of death ne'er come;
Where Christ himself will be the only light!
  Oh! may I call that land my home!
