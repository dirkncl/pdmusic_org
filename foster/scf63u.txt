"Kissing in the Dark" (1863)
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Sitting in the cosy parlor
  When the lights are long,
While the cricket 'neath the window
  Sings his daily song;
With the one we love beside us
  And no eyes to mark,
Oh how gaily glide the hours
  Kissing in the dark
    Oh how gaily glide the hours
      Kissing in the dark.

2.
Softly then the vows we murmur
  Fall upon the air,
Little hands in ours are folded,
  Gently nestling there.
Not a sweeter note of music
  Sings the morning lark,
Then is heard when lips are meeting
  Kissing in the dark
    This is heard when lips are meeting
      Kissing in the dark.

3.
Surely then we grow much bolder
  For we know this well,
That we whisper 'neath the shadows
  All love bids us tell.
Let us bless the golden hours
  With no eyes to mark,
That we pass among the maidens
  Kissing in the dark!
    That we pass among the maidens
      Kissing in the dark!
