Written and Composed at the request of a friend

1.
Bend o'er my pillow my mother dear
Life's chiling close is now drawing near
Drive about me these clouds of fear
Breath o'er my brow a parting sigh.

I have been wayward unto thee
Now I can feel it painfully
Patient and kind wert thou to me
Kiss me dear mother ere I die.

2.
Tell me of angels that dwell above
Then from my heart will the tear drops move
Whisper to me gentle words of love
While I in gloom and suff'ring lie.

I have been wayward unto thee
Now I can feel it painfully
Patient and kind wert thou to me
Kiss me dear mother ere I die.
