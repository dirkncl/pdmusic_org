"We'll All Meet Our Saviour" (1863)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We'll all meet our Saviour, if we keep His sacred word,
'Tis the promise of the Lord, the promise of the Lord,
We'll all meet our Saviour, if we keep His sacred word,
  'Tis the promise of the Lord. Amen.

2.
Then we'll live with the angels where no sin can ever come,
In a fair and happy home, a fair and happy home;
And we'll sing heav'nly praises where no sin can ever come,
  In a fair and happy home. Amen.

3.
He has gone from among us with a halo round Him bright,
To a land of love and light, a land of love and light,
He has gone and He calls us with a halo round Him bright.
  To a land of love and light. Amen.

4.
He is called our Redeemer for He suffered for us all,
That no penitent should fall, no penitent should fall;
He is called our Redeemer for He suffered for us all,
  And we harken to His call. Amen.
