"The Angels Are Singing Unto Me" (1863)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
When my mother's hands are o'er me spread,
  As I kneel, humbly praying by her knee;
When her gentle voice is round me shed,
  Then the angels are singing unto me.

CHORUS
Music from above!
Strains of joy and love!
When my soul is fill'd with melody,
Then the angels are singing unto me.

2.
When I hear the silv'ry notes of love
  From the birds gaily singing in the tree,
Then I feel that God still reigns above,
  And the angels are singing unto me.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the stars are in the placid sky,
  And soft winds are blowing o'er the lea,
Then I feel that God still dwells on high,
  And the angels are singing unto me.

(CHORUS)

4.
When I hear the laughing, gurgling stream,
  Or the waves of the deep and plunging sea,
Then I'm lull'd into a pleasant dream,
  And the angels are singing unto me.

(CHORUS)
