"We Still Keep Marching" (1863)
Words by Mrs. Mary Ann Kidder
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
No matter what temptations
  Assail us on our way,
We'll still keep trav'ling onward
  Along the heav'nly way;
We'll practice good to others
  While living here below,
And daily pray to God each day,
  As marching on we go.

CHORUS
We'll still keep marching on,
  marching on, marching on,
We'll still keep marching on,
  marching on to the end.

2.
If enemies revile us,
  We'll not revile again;
For Jesus, our example,
  Once dwelt with sinful men;
He patient was and lowly,
  To friend as well as foe;
Then let us strive like Him to live,
  As marching on we go!

(CHORUS)

3.
We'll study well the Bible
  The holy word of God,
'Twill prove a lamp to guide us
  Along the toilsome road.
We'll sing the songs of Zion
  When in the valleys low;
Bethlehem's star will shine afar,
  As marching on we go!

(CHORUS)
