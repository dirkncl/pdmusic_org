Written and Composed for Master Wood, of Wood's Minstrels.
Words by Francis D. Murtha
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Oh! why am I so happy,
  Why these feelings of delight?
And why does gladness cheer me?
  Why every thing so bright?
'Tis my father's voice and brother's smile,
  My sister's fond caress,
My mother's gentle pleading prayer,
  Her little boy to bless.

REFRAIN
Why, ah why am I so happy,
  Why these feelings of delight?
Oh, why does gladness beam around?
  Why every thing so bright?

2.
I see the angels smiling
  When at my father's side,
And glowing scenes of pleasure
  Before my vision glide.
O, how pleasant to the quiet eve
  I feel so full of joy
Whene'er he breathes the gentle prayer
  To guide his little boy.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Sometimes, when bending o'er me,
  I've heard my mother sigh,
And then I've seen the tear-drop
  Stand trembling in her eye
While she said she dreamed of future days
  Of bliss without alloy.
And prayed that heaven would shower down
  Rich blessings on her boy.

(REFRAIN)
