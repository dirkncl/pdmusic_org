1. In vain my roving tho’ts would find 
A portion worthy of the mind; 
On earth my soul can never rest, 
For earth can never make me blest, 
For earth can never make me blest.

2. Can lasting happiness be found 
Where seasons roll their hasty round, 
And days and hours, with rapid flight, 
Sweep cares and pleasures out of sight, 
Sweep cares and pleasures out of sight.

3. Arise, my tho’ts; my heart arise; 
Leave this vain world and seek the skies; 
There purest joys for ever last, 
When seasons, days, and hours are past, 
When seasons, days, and hours are past.
