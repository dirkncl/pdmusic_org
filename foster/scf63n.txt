"There Are Fishing Plenty of Fish in the Sea" (1863)
Words by George Cooper, 1836-1927
Music by Stephen Collings Foster, 1826-1864

1.
A lady tossed her curls
  At all who came to woo;
She laughed to scorn the vows,
  From hearts though false or true,
While merrily she sang,
  And cared all day for naught,
There are plenty of fish in the sea,
  As good as ever were caught.

[REFRAIN]
There are plenty of fish in the sea,
  As good as ever were caught.

2.
Upon their lightning wings
  The merry years did glide,
A careless life she led,
  And was not yet a bride;
Still as of old she sang
  Though few to win her sought.
There are plenty of fish in the sea
  As good as ever were caught.

(REFRAIN)

3.
At lengthy the lady grew
  Exceedingly alarmed,
For beaux had grown quite shy,
  Her face no longer charmed.
And now she sadly sings
  The lesson time has taught,
There are plenty of fish in the sea,
  But, oh, they're hard to be caught.

(REFRAIN)
