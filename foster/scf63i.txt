"Oh! There's No Such Girl As Mine" (1863)
Words by Samuel Lover
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Oh, there's no such girl as mine,
  In all this wide world 'round,
With her hair of gold so fine,
  And her voice of silver sound;
Her eyes are as black as the sloe,
  Her lips in a smile combine,
Her breath us as pure as the snow:
  There's no such girl as mine.

CHORUS
There's no such girl as mine,
In all this wide world 'round,
With her hair of gold so fine,
And her voice of silver sound.

2.
Oh, her soul in sweetness flows,
  She's gainer of all hearts,
There's a smile where'er she goes,
  And a sigh when she departs;
She's loved by the rich and the poor,
  She is free from all dark design,
She's welcome at every door,--
  There's no such girl as mine.

(CHORUS)

3.
She is light to the banquet ball,
  She's balm to the couch of care,
When around us troubles fall,
  She calmly takes here share;
At home or when far away,
  Her virtues will ever shine,
Her heart is as open as day,--
  There's no such girl as mine.
