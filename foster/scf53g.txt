"Foster's Melodies No. 23
"Little Ella"
Song
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Little Ella, fairest, dearest
Unto me and unto mine,
Earthly cherub coming nearest
To my dreams of forms divine;
Her brief absence frets and pains me,
Her bright presence so lace brings,
Her spontaneous love restrains me
From a thousand and selfish things.

2.
Little Ella moveth lightly
Like a graceful fawn at play,
Like a brooklet running brightly
In the genial smile of May,
Like a breeze upon the meadows
All be-sprent with early flowers.
Like a bird mid sylvan shadows
In the golden summer hours.

3.
Little Ella brings a blessing
With her bright and winning smile,
With her frank and fond caressing
And her prattle free from guile.
When I hear her footsteps bonding,
In the hall or through the grove,
And her voice with joy resounding,
'Tis the music that I love.
