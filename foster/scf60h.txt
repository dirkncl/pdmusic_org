1.
Come, I am longing to hear thee,
Beautiful child of song,
Come though the hearts that are near thee,
Around thee devotedly throng.

Come, I am longing to hear thee,
Beautiful child of song.

Beautiful child of song,
I'm longing to hear thee carol thy lay,
sweet child of song.

2.
Come, for the spell of a fairy
Dwells in thy magical voice,
And at thy step, light and airy,
E'en cold hearts enraptured rejoice.

Come, I am longing to hear thee,
Beautiful child of song.

Beautiful child of song,
I'm longing to hear thee carol thy lay,
sweet child of song.
