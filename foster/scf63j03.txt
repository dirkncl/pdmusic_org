"Tears Bring Thoughts of Heaven" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Blame not those who weep and sigh
  When to saddness given;
Kindly view the tearful eye,
  Tears bring thoughts of Heaven.

2.
When in death our friends depart,
  When are hopes are riven;
Tears brings comfort to the heart,
  Tears bring thoughts of Heaven.

3.
To the suffering child of earth
  Unto madness driven,
Hallowed hours when tears have birth,
  Tears bring thoughts of Heaven.
