"Under the Willow She's Sleeping" (1860)
Song
Written and Composed
(Poetry and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Under the willow she's laid with care --
(Sang a lone mother while weeping,)
Under the willow, with golden hair,
My little one's quietly sleeping.

CHORUS
Fair, fair, and golden hair,
(Sang a lone mother while weeping,)
Fair, fair, and golden hair,
Under the willow she's sleeping.

2.
Under the willow no songs are heard,
Near where my darling lies dreaming;
Nought but the voice of some far off bird
Where life and its pleasures are beaming.

(CHORUS)

3.
Under the willow by night and day
Sorrowing ever I ponder;
Free from its shadowy, gloomy rar
Ah! never again can she wander.

(CHORUS)

4.
Under the willow I breathe a prayer
Longing to linger forever
Near to my angel with golden hair
In lands where there's sorrowing never.

(CHORUS)
