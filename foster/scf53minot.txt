1. Triumphant Zion! lift thy head
From dust, and darkness, and the dead! 
Tho’ humbled long, awake at length.
And gird thee with the Savior’s strength!

2. Put all thy beauteous garments on.
And let thy excellence be known!
Decked in the robes of righteousness.
Thy glories shall the world confess.

3. No more shall foes unclean invade.
And fill thy hallowed walls with dread;
No more shall hell’s insulting host
Their vic’try and thy sorrows boast.

4. God from on high has heard thy prayer;
His hand they ruin shall repair.
Nor will thy watchful monarch cease
To guard thee to eternal peace.
