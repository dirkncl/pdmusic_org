"Don't Bet You Money on the Shanghai" (1861)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
De Shanghai chicken, when you put him in de pit,
He'll eat a loaf of bread up, but he can't fight a bit;
De Shaghai fiddle is a funny little thing,
And ebry time you tune him up he goes ching, ching.

CHORUS
Oh! de Shaghai!
Don't bet your money on de Shanghai,
Take de little chicken in de middle ob de ring,
But don't bet you money on de Shanghai.

2.
I go to de fair for to see de funny fowls,
De double-headed pigion and de one-eyed owls;
De old lame goose wid no web between his toes,
He kills himself a laughing when de Shaghai crows.

(CHORUS)

3.
De Shanghai's tall but his appetite is small,
He'll only swallow ebry thing that he can overhaul;
Four bags of wheat just as certain as you're born,
A bushel of potatoes and a tub full of corn.

(CHORUS)
