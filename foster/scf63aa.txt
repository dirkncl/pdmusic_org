"We Will Keep a Bright Lookout" (1863)
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We will keep a bright lookout,
  That we do not go astray;
We will keep a bright lookout,
    Night and day;
Tho' we are a youthful band,
We will work with heart and hand,
Till we gain the starry land,
    Fay away.

CHORUS
We'll all be happy,
All be happy,
Happy in the land far away.

2.
We will keep a bright lookout,
  While upon the earth we stay,
We will keep a bright lookout
    Night and day;
O! our hearts are stout and strong,
And we'll seek to conquer wrong,
Till we sing the victor's song,
    Far away.

(CHORUS)

3.
We will keep a bright lookout,
  Jesus will our care repay;
We will keep a bright lookout
    Night and day;
We will steadily push on,
Till our labor here is done,
And heavenly crown is won,
    Far away.

(CHORUS)

4.
We will keep a bright lookout
  And our Saviour's word obey,
We will keep a bright lookout,
    Night and day.
If we strive to do our best,
God will take us to his brest,
And his peaceful home of rest,
    Far away.

(CHORUS)
