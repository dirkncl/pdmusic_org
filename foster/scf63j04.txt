"Leave Me With My Mother" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Leave me with my mother, for her voice is sweet,
  Sweeter, sweetest melody.
Leave me with my mother, for she clings to me,
  Fondly, fondly clings to me!

2.
Leave me with my mother, for I love her more,
  Far more than you know,
Leave me with my mother, for her heart is pure,
  Purer, purer than the snow.

3.
Leave me with my mother and prayers of love,
  Fervent, fervent prayers of love.
Leave me with my mother, she is heard above,
  Kindly, kindly heard above.
