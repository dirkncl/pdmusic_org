1. Blest are the men whose hearts do more
And melt with sympathy and love;
From Christ, the Lord, shall they obtain
Like sympathy and love again,
Like sympathy and love again.

2. Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean
From the defilling power of sin;
With endless pleasure, they shall see 
A God of spotless purity,
A God of spotless purity.

3. Blest are the men of peaceful life,
Who quence the coals of growing strife;
They shall be called the heirs of bliss,—
The sons of God, the God of peace,
The sons of God, the God of peace.
