1.
[MRS. BROWN]
So Mister Brown you've come at last,
I'm sure it's after two.
[MR. BROWN]
Dear Mistress Brown, you clock is fast,
I know as well as you.
[MRS. BROWN]
Oh! Sir, it's shameful so it is,
Don't come sir in my sight!
[MR. BROWN]
Now give me one good kiss to night,
You see that I am right.

[BOTH]
[MRS. BROWN]
I cannot talk to you to night, 
I see that you're not right.
Oh! Harry Brown! O! Harry Brown!
You're any thing but right.
[MR. BROWN]
Now give me one good kiss to night,
You see that I'm all right.
Oh! Mary Brown! O! Mary Brown!
You know that I am right.

2.
She.  All right! you good for nothing you,
        Have I not eyes to see?
He.   No, Madam, what I say is true.
        I'm only on a spree!
She.  Don't make me angry, Mr. Brown.
        For if you do I'll cry!
He.   I'll not stay to see you frown,
        So, Mrs. Brown, good bye.
   He.  {I shall not stay to see you frown,
Both.   {  So, Mrs. Brown, good bye.
   She. {I'll make you stay to see my frown,
        {  You shall not say good bye.
   He.  {O! Mary Brown, O! Mary Brown,
Both.   {  I'll have to say good bye.
   She. {O! Harry Brown, O! Harry Brown,
        { You see you've made me cry.

3.  She. _Furiously._
Hard hearted man, I tell you what,
  I must know where you've been;
I am not jealous, O! no! no!
  But it's a shame and sin!
Your bosom friend, young Jones, just left,
  He calls here every night,
I'm sure if it were not for him
  I'd really die with fright.
   She.  {I'm sure if it were not for him
Both.   {  I'd really die with fright.
   He.  {What Ma'am, if it were not for him
        {  You say you'd die with fright!
   He.  {O! Mary Brown, O! Mary Brown,
Both.   {  I'll call him out to fight!
   She. {O! Harry Brown, O! Harry Brown,
        { He's far above your height.

4. He. _Indignantly_
So, Mr. Jones was here, you say
  While I have been away!
Now Madam you will drive me mad,
  We part this very day.
You know it is my business ma'am
  That keeps me at the store,
And if I could have sooner come (_hic_)
  I'd been here (_hic_) long before.
   He.  {You know it is my business ma'am
Both.   {  That keeps me at the store.
   She. {You know it's not your business sire
        {  That keeps you at the store.
   He.  {O! Mary Brown, O! Mary Brown,
Both.   {  It's business at the store.
   She. {O! Harry Brown, O! Harry Brown,
        { You've told me that before.

5.  She. _Coaxingly._
There don't be angry, husband, don't!
  I'm sure I love you dear,
I was joking when I said
  That odious Jones was here.
But promise me, now won't you love,
  That when the night has come
You'll never stay away so late,
  And leave your wife at home.
   She.  {Now promise me when night has come,
Both.   {  You'll always stay at home.
   He.  {I promise you when night has come,
        {  I'll always stay at home.
   He.  {O! Mary Brown, O! Mary Brown,
Both.   {  I'll always stay at home.
   She. {O! Harry Brown, O! Harry Brown,
        { Now won't you stay at home.

6.  He. _Lovingly._
You were but joking, dearest wife?
  Now come and kiss me, do,
Jones is a bosom friend to me (_seriously_)
  But needn't be to you.
My little wife! my joy and life!
  My gentle pretty elf,
If any one sits up with you
  Hereafter, it's myself.
   He.  {If any one sits up with you
Both.   {  Hereafter, it's myself.
   She. {If any one sits up with me
        {  O, let it be yourself.
   He.  {O! Mary Brown, O! Mary Brown,
Both.   {  Our quarrels they are o'er.
   She. {O! Harry Brown, O! Harry Brown,
        { We'll never quarrel more.
