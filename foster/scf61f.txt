Ballad
Music and Poetry
(Poetry and Music by)
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I remember the days of our your and love,
When we sat neath the green oak tree;
When thy smiles were bright as the skies above,
And the voice made music unto me.

CHORUS
Never more will come those happy, happy hours,
Whiled away in life's young dawn;
Never more we'll roam through pleasure's sunny bowers,
For our bright, bright summer days are gone.

2.
I remember the flowers that we cull'd by day,
And the vows that we made at night;
I remember the brook where we love to stray
In the by gone days of our delight.

(CHORUS)

3.
How we joyed when we met, and grieved to part,
How we sighed when the night came on;
How I longed for thee in my dreaming heart,
Till the first fair coming of the dawn.

(CHORUS)
