Quartette
Written and Composed by

1.
Come where my lies dreaming,
Dreaming the happy hours away,
In visions bright redeeming
The fleeting joys of day;
Dreaming the happy hours away, (Dreaming,)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Dreaming the happy hours away.
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Come with a lute toned lay; (Her beauty beaming;)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Dreaming the happy hours away.
Come with a lute, come with a lay,
My own love is sweetly dreaming,
(Come, come, come, come, come, come,)
Her beauty beaming; (come, come, come, come, come;)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Dreaming the happy hours away.

Soft in her slumber;
Thoughts bright and free
Dance through her dreams
Like gushing melody;
Light is her young heart,
Light may it be;
Come where my love lies dreaming.
Dreaming the happy hours, (Come where my love lies dreaming,)
Dreaming the happy hours away; (Dreaming,)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Come with a lute toned lay; (Her beauty beaming;)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Dreaming the happy hours away.
Come with a lute, come with a lay,
My own love is sweetly dreaming,
(Come, come, come, come, come, come,)
Her beauty beaming; (come, come, come, come, come;)
Come where my lies dreaming, (My own love is sweetly)
Dreaming the happy hours away.

Dreaming the happy hours away.
