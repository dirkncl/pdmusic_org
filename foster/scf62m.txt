"I'll Be Home To-Morrow" (1862)
Ballad
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I've wander'd far from those I love, and many years have pass'd,
Since in my dear old cheris'd home I saw their faces last;
But now I am returning and my journey soon will end,
I'll join the throng where happy smiles and gentle voices blend.

CHORUS
Farewell, farewell!
Ev'ry cloud of sorrow,
All my heart is fill'd with joy
For I'll be home to-morrow!

2.
How dear the hearts that dwell within that sweet domestic realm!
I know that they have long'd for me as I have long'd for them;
The thought that I am near them, makes my lonely spirit yearn
To hear the burst of gladness that welcome my return!

(CHORUS)
