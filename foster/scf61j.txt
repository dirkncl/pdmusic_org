"Farewell Mother Dear" (1861)
Ballad
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Farewell! mother dear; I go
Wher loved ones never can be parted.
We will meet again I know;
Be not weeping and down hearted.
Last night I dreamed of thee
Saying pleasant things to me;
Still again those vigils keep
While I lay me gently down to sleep.
  Oh! Farewell, mother dear, I go
  Where loved ones can never be parted.
  We will meet again I know;
  Be not weeping and down hearted/

2.
Weep not mother dear for me
When I'm laid underneath the willow;
I'll keep guard upon thy soul;
Thou hast guarded o'er my pillow.
Far in a radiant land
I will join a suster band
They are singing a sweet refrain
I am called: Farewell! we meet again.
  Oh! Farewell, mother dear, I go
  Where loved ones can never be parted.
  We will meet again I know;
  Be not weeping and down hearted/
