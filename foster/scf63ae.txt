"My Boy Is Coming from the War" (1863)
Written by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
My boy is coming from the war,
  He's coming home to me,
O! how I long to see his face,
  And hear his voice of glee.
Of all the days that ever dawned
  This is the brightest day,
For sad and lonely was my heart
  When Harry went away.

CHORUS
My boy is coming from the war
  He's coming home to me,
O! how I long to see his face,
  And hear his voice of glee.

2.
My boy is coming from the war,
  I've waited for him long,
I miss the music of his laugh,
  His light and happy song;
But now I'll clasp him in my arms
  And ever by my side,
He'll linger while my life glides on
  To quiet eventide.

(CHORUS)

3.
My boy is coming from the war
  The mother fondly said,
While on the gory battle plain
  Her boy was lying dead!
His comrades came with lightsome steps
  And sound of martial drums,
But now that Mother sadly waits
  For one who'll never come!

CHORUS
My boy is coming from the war
  The mother fondly said,
While on the gory battle plain
  Her boy was lying dead!
