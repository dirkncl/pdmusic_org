"Willie's Gone to Heaven" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Little Willie's gone to heaven,
  Praise the Lord!
All his sins are forgiven,
  Praise the Lord!

CHORUS
Joyful let your voices rise,
Do not come with tearful eyes,
Willie's dwelling in the skies,
  Willie's gone to heaven.

2.
Little Willie murmured never,
  Praise the Lord!
Willie's soul will live forever,
  Praise the Lord!

(CHORUS)

3.
In departing he was cheerful,
  Praise the Lord!
He was hopeful, never fearful,
  Praise the Lord!

(CHORUS)

4.
All the light on him has broken,
  Praise the Lord!
That from Christ was kindly spoken,
  Praise the Lord!

(CHORUS)
