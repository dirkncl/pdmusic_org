Foster's Melodies, No. 26
"Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair" (1854)
Written and Composed
(Poetry and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I dream of Jeanie with the light hair,
Borne, like a vapor on the summer air,
I see her tripping where the bright streams play,
Happy as the  daisies that dance on her way.
Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour.
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er:
Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

2.
I long for Jeanie with the day-dawn smile,
Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile;
I hear her melodies, like joys gone by,
Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die:--
Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,--
Waiting for the lost one that comes not again:
Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low,
Never more to find her where the bright waters flow.

3.
I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed
Far from the fond hearts round her native glade;
Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown,
Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.
Now the nodding wild flowers may whither on the shore
While her gentle fingers will cull them no more:
Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair.
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.
