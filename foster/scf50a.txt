1.
Oh! Lemuel my lark,
Oh Lemuel my beau,
I's guine to gib a ball to night,
I'd hab you for to know;
But if you want to dance,
Just dance outside de door;
Becayse your feet so berry large
Dey'll cover all de floor.
Oh! Lem! Lem! Lem!
Lemuel I say!
Go down to de cotten field,
And bring de boys away.

CHORUS (2 times)
Go down to de cotten field!
Go down, I say!
Go down and call de Nigga boys all,
We'll work no more* to day

2.
Oh! Lemuel my hope,
Oh! Lemuel my joy
I'll tell you who'll be at de ball
My woolly headed boy.
Dere's Nelly Bly, you know,
And Juliana Snow,
Dere's cane-brake Kitty likes de boys,
Ans she'll be sure to go.
Oh! Lem! Lem! Lemuel I say!
Go down to de cotten field and bring de boys away.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Oh! Lemuel is tall,
Oh! Lemuel is fair,
Oh! Lemuel has gone to day
To take de morning air.
He makes de fiddle hum,
He makes de banjo tum,
He rattles on de old jaw bone,
And beats upon de drum.
Oh! Lem! Lem! Lemuel I say!
Go down to de cotten field and bring de boys away.

(CHORUS 2 times)

*The pause over the word _more_ to be used in the
