"Little Belle Blair" (1861)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We have made a grave for little Belle Blair,
  In the fields beyond the town,
In the world she lived without a passing care,
  And her brow was ever from a frown.

CHORUS
Happy as the live long day she,
  And flowing was her dark glossy hair,
We will hear no more her winning melody,
  For we've parted with our little Belle Blair.

2.
In the balmy spring we wandered side by side,
  Through the hours of health and glee,
And our joys flowed on with ever gushing tide,
  Like the bubbles of the wide blue sea.

(CHORUS)

3.
In the bloom of youth and all her childish mirth,
  In the May day of her life,
She has left the cares and busy broils of earth,
  For a better world beyond all strife.

(CHORUS)
