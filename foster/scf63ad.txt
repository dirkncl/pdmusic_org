  "DEARER THAN LIFE."--As there have been numerous songs
published since the death of the lamented Composer, Stephen
Collins Foster, as posthumous compositions, which were not
genuine, but frauds upon a credulous public, I deem it
necessary, and desire, to state the manner in which the
melody of "Dearer than Life" came into my possession.
Some three weeks before his death, Mr. Foster called
upon me, and as was usual with him, commenced improvising
on the Piano, during a social chat, and, dotting down this
melody, presented it to me as a memento of our friendship.
I have treasured it as such; but, feeling that the public
had a right to _any_ composition of their favorite song-writer,
I have endeavored to express the sentiment of the melody in
the words thereto, and present it to the readers of Demorest's
Magazine.

"Dearer Than Life!" (Meet Me Tonight Dearest)
[melody composed December 1863; published 6 March 1869]
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Sweet is the breath of the fair, dewy morn,
Sweet is the Spring when the Roses are born,
Dear is the light of the eyes that we love,
Dear is our welcome when homeward we rove;

(REFRAIN)
Dearer, still dearer, in you or in strife,
Dearer that all art thou, dearer than life!

2.
Tell me you love me again and again!
Parted from thee, oh! wearisome pain!
Morn has no beauty to equal thy face,
Spring has no lillies to equal thy grace!

(REFRAIN)
Dear to me ever, in joy or in strife,
Dearer than all art thou, dearer than life!
