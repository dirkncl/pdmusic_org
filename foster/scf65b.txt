"Our Darling Kate" (1865)
Words and Melody by John Mahon
Music arranged by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
There's a bright-eyesd maid comes thro' the garden gate,
Light as the wild [one?] bounding
O! well I know she is our darling Kate,
For her voice in my heart is pounding;
And her ligh merry laugh, as mellow, soft, and clear,
On summer breezes ringing,
Like a silver bell strikes on the ravished ear,
And flow'rs 'neath her feet are springing.

CHORUS
Darling, darling, darling little Kate,
Fair as the star of morning,
Thine this heart, whatever be my fate,
Till the lamp of life cearse burning.

2.
Her radiant face is seen amid the trees,
Bright as the sunlight beaming,
Her fragrant breath gives oder tp the breeze,
And her eyes like twin stars are burning;
And bright normal forms upon her [?] await
On [?] bright pinions soaring,
They come to greet our darling little Kate,
Her angel form adoring.

(CHORUS)

3.
Her raven curls hung o'er a neck of snow,
Bath'd in the sunbeams brightness,
Her peachlike cheek with modest blushes glow,
And her brow [shames?] the lily's whiteness;
O! were I posses'd of India's vast entals,
Or the fabled wealth of story,
I'd give tham all for darling little Kate,
Our own bright Morning-glory.

(CHORUS)
