"A Thousand Miles from Home" (1861)
Ballad
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Far from my childhood's scenes, with weary steps I roam;
Laden with weight of care, a thousand miles from home;
Old them return to me,
Days of pleasure[,] nights of glee;
While I'm beyond the sea a thousand miles from home.

A thousand miles from home.
Oh! how the heart will droop, a thousand miles from home.

2.
Where are those early hopes, that made my footsteps stray;
Faded while summer bowers are blooming on my way;
Sweet song of birds I hear,
Childhood's voices bright and clear;
All fail my soul to cheer a thousand miles from home.

A thousand miles from home.
Oh! how the heart will droop, a thousand miles from home.
