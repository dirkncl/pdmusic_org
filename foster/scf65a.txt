"The Voices That Are Gone" (1865)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
When the twilight shades fall o'er me
  And the evening star appears
Memory brings the past before me
  Joys and sorrows, smiles and tears.
Then again bright eyes are gleaming
  With the love once in them shone
Then like music music heard when dreaming
  Come the voices that are gone.

CHORUS
Once again bright eyes are gleaming
  with the light that in them shone
Then like music heard when dreaming
  Come the voices that are gone.

2.
Sweet as wood dove's note when calling
  To her mate as night draws on,
Soft as snow flake lightly falling
  Come the voices that are gone.
Voices heard in days of childhood
  Softly at the hour of prayer,
Or loud ringing through the wildwood
  When the young heart knew no care.

(CHORUS)

3.
So when life's bright sun is setting
  And its day is well nigh done,
May there be no vain regretting
  Over memories I would shun;
But when death is o'er, to meet me
  May some much-lov'd forms come on,
And the first sounds that shall greet me
  Be the voices that were gone!

(CHORUS)
