Foster's Melodies, No. 28
"Hard Times Come Again No More" (1854)
Written and Composed
(Poetry and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
  While we all sup sorrow with the poor;
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears;--
  Oh! Hard Timesm come again no more.

CHORUS
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;--
  Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
  Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

2.
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
  There are frail forms fainting at the door;
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say--
  Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

(CHORUS)

3.
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
  With a worn heart whose better days are o'er;
Though her voice would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day--
  Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

(CHORUS)

4.
'Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
  'Tis a wail that is hear upon the shore,
'Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave,--
  Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

(CHORUS)
