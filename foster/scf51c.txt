[JULIET]
Wilt thou be gone, wilt thou be gone, love,
gone, love, from me?
Stay! 'tis the Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.
Deem not 'tis the Lark, love;
day is not yet near --
Believe me, 'tis the Nightingale whose song hath
pierced thine ear.
Wilt thou be gone,
wilt thou be gone,([ROMEO] I must be gone,)

[Overlapped voices]
[JULIET] love, wilt thou be gone from thee?
[ROMEO]  love, I must be gone from thee.

[JULIET] Stay 'tis the Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.
[ROMEO]  'Tis not the Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.

[ROMEO]  'Tis the Lark, 'tis the Lark,
[JULIET] Love, 'tis the Nightingale, love,

[JULIET] 'tis the Nightingale, love, 'tis the
[ROMEO]  'tis the Lark, 'tis the

[JULIET] Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.
[ROMEO]  Lark, love, that sings in yonder tree.

[JULIET] Wilt thou be gone, wilt thou be gone, love,
[ROMEO]  I must be gone, I must be gone, love,

[JULIET] gone, love, from me -- gone, love, from me?
[ROMEO]  gone, love, from thee -- gone, love, from thee.

[ROMEO]
It is Lark, the herald of the morn, love; no Nightingale.
See! the clouds are bright'ning, the stars are growing pale --
Day is on yon mountain top that veils the eastern sky --
I must be gone and live, love, or stay with thee and die
I must be gone,

[Overlapped voices]
[JULIET] love, wilt thou be gone from thee?
[ROMEO]  love, I must be gone from thee.

[JULIET] Stay 'tis the Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.
[ROMEO]  'Tis not the Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.

[ROMEO]  'Tis the Lark, 'tis the Lark,
[JULIET] Love, 'tis the Nightingale, love,

[JULIET] 'tis the Nightingale, love, 'tis the
[ROMEO]  'tis the Lark, 'tis the

[JULIET] Nightingale that sings in yonder tree.
[ROMEO]  Lark, love, that sings in yonder tree.

[JULIET] Wilt thou be gone, wilt thou be gone, love,
[ROMEO]  I must be gone, I must be gone, love,

[JULIET] gone, love, from me -- gone, love, from me?
[ROMEO]  gone, love, from thee -- gone, love, from thee.
