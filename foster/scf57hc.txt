1. Behold th’expected time draw near, 
The shades disperse, the dawn appear. 
Behold the wilderness assume 
The beauteous tints of Eden’s bloom, 
The beauteous tints of Eden’s bloom.

2. Events with prophecies conspire
To raise our faith, our zeal to fire,
The ripening fields, already white,
Present a harvest to the sight, 
Present a harvest to the sight.

3. The untaught heathen waits to know
The joy the gospel will bestow;
The exiled captive, to receive
The freedom Jesus has to give,
The freedom Jesus has to give.
