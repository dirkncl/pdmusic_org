To Miss Mary D. Keller, of Pittsburg, PA.
"There's a Good Time Coming" (1846)
Song.
Lines from the London Daily News.
[Words by Charles Mackay]

1.
There'a a good time coming, boy's,
A good time coming;
We may not live to see the day,
But earth shall glisten to the ray.
Of the good time coming,
Cannon balls may aid the truthm
But thought's a weapon stronger;
We'll win our battle by its aid;--
Wait a little longer.

2.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming:
The pen shall supersede the sword,
And right, not might, shall be the lord,
In the good time coming;
Worth, not birth, shall rule mankind,
And be acknowledg'd stronger;
The proper impulse has been giv'n;
Wait a little longer.

3.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
War in all mens eyes shall be
A monster of iniquity.
In the good time coming,
Nations shall not quarrel then,
To prove which is the stronger;
Nor slaughter men for glory's sake;--
Wait a little longer.

4.
There's a good time coming, boy's,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
Shameful rivalries of creed
Shall not make the martyr bleed.
In the good time coming,
Religion shall be shorn of pride,
And flourish all the longer;
And Charity shall trim her lamp;--
Wait a little longer.

5.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
And a poor mans family,
Shall not be his misery,
In the good time coming;
Ev'ry child shall be a help,
To make his right arm stronger;
The happier he, the more he has;
Wait a little longer.

6.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
Little children shall not toil
Under, or above the soil.
In the good time coming,
But shall play in healthful fields,
Till limbs and minds grow stronger;
And ev'ry one shall read and write;--
Wait a little longer.

7.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
The people shall be temperate,
And shall love instead of hate,
In the good time coming.
They shall use, and not abuse,
And make all virtue stronger;
The reformation has begun;--
Wait a little longer.

8.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming,
A good time coming;
Let us aid it all we can,
Ev'ry woman ev'ry man,
The good time coming.
Smallest helps, if rightly giv'n,
Make the impulse stronger;
'Twill be strong enough one day;--
Wait a little longer.
