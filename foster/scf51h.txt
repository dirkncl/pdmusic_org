"Ring, Ring de Banjo!" (1851)
New Ethiopian Melody
Words and Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
De time is nebber dreary
  If de darkey nebber groans;
De ladies nebber weary
  Wid de rattle ob de bones:
Den come again Susanna
  By de gaslight ob de moon;
We'll tum de old Piano
  When de banjo's out ob tune.

CHORUS 2 times
Ring, ring de banjo!
  I like dat good old song,
Come again my true lub,
  Oh! wha you been so long.

2.
Oh! nebber count de bubles
  While der's water in de spring:
De darkey hab no troubles
  While he's got his song to sing.
De beauties of creation
 Will neb ber lose der charm
While I roam de old plantation
  Wid my true lub on my arm.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Once I was so lucky,
  My massa set me free,
I went to old Kentucky
  To see what I could see;
I could not go no farder,
  I turn to massa's door,
I lub him all de harder,
  I'll go away no more.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
Early in de morning
  Ob a lubbly summer day,
My massa send me warning
  He'd like to hear me play.
On de banjo tapping,
  I come wid dulcem strain;
Massa fall a napping --
  He'll nebber wake again.

(CHORUS 2 times)

5.
My lub, I'll hab to leabe you
  While de ribber's running high;
But I nebber can deceibe you --
  So dont you wipe your eye.
I's guine to make some money;
  But I'll come anodder day --
I'll come again my honey,
  If I hab to work my way.

(CHORUS 2 times)
