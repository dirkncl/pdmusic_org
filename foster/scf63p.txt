"Lena Our Loved One Is Gone" (1863)
Ballad
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Lena, the pride of our home,
Gone from the earth -- Oh! where does she roam?
Fond hearts still sigh o'er her tomb,
Lena, our loved one is gone.

Lena the gentle and fair
Happy by day and night free from care,
Lena, with light waving hair,
Lena, our loved one is gone.

2.
Lena, with youn tender eyes,
Lending to earth the light of the skies
Lena's dear mem'ry ne'er dies,
Lena our loved one is gone.

Pure as the dew drop was she
Smiling on earth ever joyous and free,
Dear, dear to sad memory --
Lena our loved on is gone.
