"The Merry, Merry Month of May" (1862)
Written and Composed espressly
for Clark's School Visitor,
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We roamed the fields and river sides,
When we were young and gay;
We chased the bees and plucked the flowers,
In the merry, merry month of May.
  Oh, yes, with ever changing sports,
  We whiled the hours away;
  The skies were bright,
  Our hearts were light,
  In the merry, merry month of May.

2.
Our voices echo'd through the glen,
With blithe and joyful ring;
We built our huts of mossey stones,
And we dabbled in the hillside spring.
  Oh, yes, with ever changing sports,
  We whiled the hours away;
  The skies were bright,
  Our hearts were light,
  In the merry, merry month of May.

3.
We joyed to meet and griev'd to part,
We sigh'd when night came on;
We wnt to rest with longing heart,
For the coming of the brightday dawn.
  Oh, yes, with ever changing sports,
  We whiled the hours away;
  The skies were bright,
  Our hearts were light,
  In the merry, merry month of May.
