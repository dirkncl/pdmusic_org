"I See Her Still My Dreams" (1857)
Ballad
Poetry and Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
While the flow'rs bloom in gladness and spring birds rejoice
There's a void in our household of one gentle voice.
The form of a loved one hath passed from the light,
But the sound of her footfall returns with the nigh;
For I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams,

Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams.
I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams,
Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams.

2.
Though her voice once familiar hath gone from the day
And her smiles from the sunlight have faded away,
Though I wake to a scene now deserted and bleak,
In my visions I find the lost form I seek;
For I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams,

Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams.
I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams,
Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams.
