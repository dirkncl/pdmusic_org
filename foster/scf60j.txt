"Down Among the Cane-Brakes" (1860)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Once I could laugh and play,
When in life's early day,
Then I was far away--
  down among the cane-brakes.

CHORUS
Down among the cane-brakes on the Mississippi shore;
Oh! those happy days, those happy days are o'er!
Oh! those happy days will come back no more!

2.
Yes, I was free from care;
All the bright summer there;
Dark days to me were fair--
  Down among the cane-brakes.

(CHORUS)

3.
There lived my mother dear,
(Gone from this world I fear),
There rang our voices clear,
  Down among the cane-brakes.

(CHORUS)

4.
There lived a lovely one,
Who like the rest has gone, --
She might have been my own,
  Down among the cane-brakes.

(CHORUS)

5.
Long years have glided by,
Since then I breathed each sigh, --
May I return to die;
  Down among the cane-brakes.

(CHORUS)
