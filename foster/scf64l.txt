"Little Mac! Little Mac! You're the Very Man" (1864)
Campaign Song
Words by [???] Henrietta Foster Thornton
Music by [???] Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Little Mac, little Mac, you're the very man,
Go down to Washington as soon as you can --
Lincoln's got to get away and make room for you,
We must be Lincoln and Johnson too.

CHORUS
Hurrah, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Sound the rally tho' the whole United States
Little Mac and Pendleton are our candidates.
Sound the rally tho' the whole United States
Little Mac and Pendleton are our candidates.

2.
Democrats, Democrats, do it up brown
Lincoln and his Niggerheads won't go down.
Greeley and Summerland all that crew,
We must beat Lincoln and Johnson too.

(CHORUS)

3.
Abraham the Joker soon will discover
We'll send him on a gun boat up Salk River,
Scotch caps and military cloak's wont do,
We must beat Lincoln and Johnson too.

(CHORUS)

4.
Southern men come again, Little Mac's a trump,
He'll restore teh Union with a hop, skip and jump,
With nigger proclamations full in view,
We must beat Lincoln and Johnson too.

(CHORUS)
