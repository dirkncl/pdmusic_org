1.
[SOPRANO]
Thou hast roam'd under summer skies whilst I have weather'd the storm,
[TENOR]
I have pray'd that the angels fair would shield thy pillow from harm.
[SOPRANO]
But thou wert gone and none this soul from sadness could awaken.

[REFRAIN]
[SOPRANO]
Mine is the mourning heart!
[TENOR]
Mine is the mourning heart!
[SOPRANO]
Mine is the mourning heart!
[BOTH]
Mine (,mine) is the mourning heart!
By thee, by thee forsaken.

2.
[SOPRANO]
Thou hast whisper'd in words of love to other ears than mine,
[TENOR]
I have yielded to others charms but worship'd only thine.
[SOPRANO]
But ah! dost thou remember, love, those sacred vows we've taken.

(REFRAIN)
