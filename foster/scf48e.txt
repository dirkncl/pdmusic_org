"Away Down Souf" (1848)
[from Songs of the Sable Harmonists]
Written and Composed
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We'll put for de souf
Ah! dat's the place,
For the steeple chase and de bully hoss race --
Poker, brag, eucher, seven up and loo,
Den chime in Niggas, wont you come along too.

CHORUS
No use talkin when de Nigga wants to go,
Whar de corntop blossom and de canebrake grow;
Den come along to Cuba, and we'll dance de polka-juba,
Way down souf, whar de corn grow.

2.
My lub she hab a very large mouf,
One corner in de norf, tudder corner in de souf;
It am so long, it reach so far --
Trabble all around it on a railroad car.

(CHORUS)

3.
I went last night to see my Sally --
Two story house in Pigtail ally,
Whar de skeeters buz, fleas dey bite,
And de bull dogs howl and de tom cats fight.

(CHORUS)
