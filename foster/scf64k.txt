1.
All day long I've mourn'd thine absence.
All day long I've watched in vain,
Sadly gazing down the hillside,
Through my frosted window pane;
Now the herds are homeward straying,
One by one a-down the vale.
And my eyes are dim with watching,
And my cheeks with fear are pale,
And my eyes are dim with watching,
And my cheeks with fear are pale.

2.
In the west by yon blue mountain,
Sinks the glowing sun to rest,
And the clouds in arches looming,
Shine like pathways of the blest;
Wherefore lingers my beloved:
Tell me O ye stars of eve.
Tell me, tell me why he comes not,
Comfort to my lone heart give,
Tell me, tell me why he comes not,
Comfort to my lone heart give.
