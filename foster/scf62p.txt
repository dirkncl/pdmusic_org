"We've a Million in the Field" (1862)
1,000,000
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
    The flags are flying,
    And brave men dying,
The din of the battle is revealed;
    The Union's quaking,
    The land is shaking
Whith the tramp of a million in the field.

CHORUS
We've a million in the field,
A million in the field,
  While our flag is sighted,
  With hearts united,
We can bring a million to the field.

2.
    We were peacefull hearted
    In days departed,
While foes kept their blighting concealed,
    But they now must weather
    The storms they gather,
For they must meet a million in the field.

(CHORUS)

3.
    Down in old Kentucky,
    They're true and plucky;
They know that the Union is their shield.
    And they'll do their duty,
    In all its beauty,
When they find we've a million in the field.

(CHORUS)
