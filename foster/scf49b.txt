"My Brudder Gum" (1849)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
White folks, I'll sing for you,
  Nuffin else to do,
Spend my time a pickin' on de banjo! Hey!
  Brudder Gum.

CHORUS
My Brudder Gum,
  My Brudder Gum so fair,
All da yaller galls runin' round,
  Try to get a lock ob his hair.

2.
Hard work all de day,
  Hab no time to play,
Berry fine time a diggin' in the cornfield, Hay!
  Brudder Gum.

(CHORUS)

3.
Tudder afternoon,
  I thought I saw de moon,
Saw my true lub comin' through de cane-brake, Hay!
  Brudder Gum.

(CHORUS)

4.
Went one berry fine day,
  To ride in a one-horse sleigh,
Hollow'd to de old hoss, comin' through de toll-gate, Hay!
  Brudder Gum.

(CHORUS)
