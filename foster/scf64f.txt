Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Through varied scenes of ease and strife,
I've roam'd the whole world o'er,
But now I calmly glide through life,
While I'm sitting by my own cabin door.
I feel as happy as a king;
And free as the birds that soar,
No sounds of battle round me sing,
While I'm sitting by my own cabin door.

Sitting by my own cabin door,
Sitting by my own cabin door.

2.
My time of life is waning fast
Upon this troubles shore,
But still I smile on days gone past,
While I'm sitting by my own cabin door;
The waves of trouble on the sea,
The whirlwinds on the moor,
Can bring no sorrow now to me,
For I'm sitting by my own cabin door.

Sitting by my own cabin door,
Sitting by my own cabin door.
