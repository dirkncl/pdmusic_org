1. Oh God! my trust, preserve, defend,
My Saviour, all divine;
With saints I love my good may blend,
But cannot add to thine.
The men who other gods will seek,
In many sorrows sink;
The names they use I will not speak,
Nor their oblations drink.

2. The Lord is my allotted cup,
My heritage, my all;
The line for me by him filled up,
In pleasant places fall.
His counsel cheers my heart by night,
His name be ever blest;
Because he is upon my right,
My flesh in hope shall rest.
