"Sweet Little Maid of the Mountain" (1861)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Roaming with thee I am happy and free,
Dreaming of thee fills my heart full of glee,
Longing for thee brings a sad memory,
Sweet little maid of the mountain.
Why do I grieve when I'm left alone?
Why do I sigh when thou art gone?
We will meet when the night comes on,
Sweet little maid of the mountain!

CHORUS
We'll meet when the night comes on,
Down the glade on the leafy lawn,
We'll roam till the break of dawn,
Sweet little maid of the mountain!

2.
Over the waters we'll gracefully glide,
I've got a bark that can weather the tide,
Out on the sea I will sit by thy side,
Sweet little maid of the mountain.
Meet me at eve in the shady glen,
There I will sing a gentle strain,
You must come to that soft refrain,
Sweet little maid of the mountain!

(CHORUS)
