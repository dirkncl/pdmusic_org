from "Foster's Melodies, No. 12"
"The Love I Bear to Thee" (1863)
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
At a midnight hour when all alone,
I often sit and think of thee,
And wish that like a star I shone,
With brightness in thy memory;
That while thy form lies calm in sleep,
From every care and sorrow free,
  Thy guardian angel then would speak,
  And tell the love I bear for thee,
  The love I bear for thee.

2.
I wander where we've often stayed,
In childhood's hours now passed and gone,
I view the scenes where we have played,
And mourn the joys forever flown;
And yet I know if then would seek,
To drive me from thy memory,
  Thy guardian angel that would speak,
  And tell the love I bear for thee,
  The love I bear for thee.
