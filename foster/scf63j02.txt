"Oh! 'Tis Glorious!" (1863)
Words by Edward Nevin
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
When our earthly sun is setting,
  And its glory fading fast;
When our life's long looked for evening
  With its shadows comes at last--

CHORUS
Oh! 'tis glorious, Oh! 'tis glorious,
  To enter in the sweet refrain,
Oh! 'tis glorious, Oh! 'tis glorious,
  To know we'll meet again.

2.
When the cold sweat of the dying
  Hangs in drops upon our face;
And a secret voice assures us
  We have almost run our race.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the friends we love are standing
  Round our lonely, dying bed,
And we take our farewell parting
  Ere the spark of life has fled.

(CHORUS)
