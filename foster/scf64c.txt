"Wilt Thou Be True?" (1864)
Words by George Cooper, 1840-1827
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Wilt thou be true, dearest to me,
Though I may wander far off from thee?
Over my heart, 
  no gloom will come,
If thou art faithful
  where-e'er I roam.
Still in my dreams, 
  Thy angel face
Smiling through tear-drops
  Fondly I'll trace
Thy voice will cheer 
  Life's journey through.
Wilt thou be true, love?
  Wilt thou be true?

2.
Wilt thou be true though fate shall bring
Tempest and sorrows, clouding not spring?
Life's roses fair, 
  Now gem our way,
Wilt thou be constant
  Should these decay?
Hope's gentle star
  Beaming so bright,
Though fondly trusted
  May take its flight.
Should want and woe
  Our steps pursue,
Wilt thou be true, love?
  Wilt thou be true?

3.
Wilt thou be true though lips of scorn,
Seek to revile me when I am gone?
Say, wilt thou weep,
  When evening falls,
As busy mem'ry
  My form recalls?
Wilt thou be true?
  Doubt swiftly flies
While I am gazing
  Into thine eyes.
Through tearful gleams--
  Through tender blue
Sweetly they whisper
  Thou wilt be true!
