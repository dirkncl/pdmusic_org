"Gentle Lena Clare" (1862)
Words & Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I'm thinking of sweet Lena Clare,
With deep blue eyes and waving hair,
Her voice is soft, her face is fair
  My gentle Lena Clare.

CHORUS
Gentle Lena Clare
My dear lov'd Lena Clare
Her heart is light, her eyes are bright,
My gentle Lena Clare.

2.
I love her careless winning ways,
I love her wild and birdlike lays,
I love the grass whereon she strays
  My gentle Lena Clare.

(CHORUS)

3.
Her home is in the shady glen,
When summer comes I'll seek again,
On mountain height and lowland plain;
  My gentle Lena Clare.

(CHORUS)
