[In den Augen liegt das Herz]
Words by Franz von Kobell

Music by Franz Wilhelm Abt, 1819-1885 from Op. 54, no. 1 
Arranged by Henry Kleber

1.
In the eye abides the heart,
Every pure and tender feeling,
All emotions worth revealing,
Through the eyes their charm impart.
Words are often clothed in guile;
For the lips with fear may falter;
E'en confiding smiles may alter--
Oh! believe not in a smile!

[REFRAIN]
'Tis the eye unveils the heart.
Every pure and tender feeling,
All emotions worth revealing,
To the eyes their glow impart.

2.
If thy bosom heaves a sigh
For a fair and cherished maiden,
Though her voice with love be laden,
Mark the language of her eye
There each impulse of her soul
Beams for thee in truth and candor;
There her secret passions wander
There remain beyond control.

(REFRAIN)
