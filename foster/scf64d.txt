"When Old Friends Were Here" (1864)
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
When old friends were here,
  In days that are flown,
How fond were the hands
  Which oft clasp'd my own,
The pathways of life
  Were pleasures sunny hue,
And voices were near,
  With tones warm and true.
    All are gone!
    No loved one's near!
    I weep for the happy days
    When old friends were here,
    When old friends were here,
    Those gentle friends so dear!
    I weep for the happy days
    When old friends were here,

2.
When old friends were here
  We roamed o'er the hills,
We sang merry songs,
  As free as the rills,
But Time on its wave
  Has rudely borne away
The fair dewy flowers
  Of life's early day.
    All are gone!
    No loved one's near!
    I weep for the happy days
    When old friends were here,
    When old friends were here,
    Those gentle friends so dear!
    I weep for the happy days
    When old friends were here,
