"There Was a Time" (1863)
Written by James D. Byrne Esq.
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
There was a time, there was a time,
  When I was young and free.
And every day the village chime
  Brought music sweet to me,
The memory of some olden song,
  Some scene or flow'r or tree,
Still brings to mind the merry throng,
  That sported there with me.

Still brings to mind the merry throng,
  That sported there with me.

2.
There was a time, there was a time,
  That told us we must part.
And then the once loved village chime,
  Fell sadly on my heart.
I bade farewell to the old gray tower,
  And on the village green.
No more at evening's peaceful hour,
  My merry friends were seen.

No more at evening's peaceful hour,
  My merry friends were seen.

3.
But one again, oh! once again,
  Those joyous days appear,
Again the bells sound o'er the plain,
  And good old friends are near.
Again I hear the merry song,
  Beneath the old oak tree,
And see around the happy throng
  That sported there with me.

And see around the happy throng
  That sported there with me.
