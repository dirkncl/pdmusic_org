"Farewell Sweet Mother" (1861)
Ballad
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Farewell sweet mother,
Weep not, weep not now for me,
Though my soul must wander hither,
Weep not mother now for me.
Soon with an angel hand,
I will wander hand in hand,
To a fair and radiant land
where I will wait for thee --
  Farewell sweet mother,
  Weep not, weep not now for me,
  Though my soul must wander hither,
  Weep not mother now for me.

2.
Farewell sweet mother,
Ev'ry night I've dreamed of thee,
And thy voice was soft and gentle,
Saying pleasant things to me
While you these vigils keep,
Now I lay me down to sleep,
Mother tell me why you weep,
Oh! weep not now for me --
  Farewell sweet mother,
  Weep not, weep not now for me,
  Though my soul must wander hither,
  Weep not mother now for me.
