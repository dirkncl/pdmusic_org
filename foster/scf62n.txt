"Happy Hours at Home" (1862)
Song & Chorus
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I sit me down by my own fireside
When the winter nights come on,
And I calmly dream as the dim hours glide,
Of many pleasant scenes now gone;
Of our healthful plays in my schoolboy days,
That can never come again;
Of our summer joys and our Christmas toys,
And rambles o'er the streamlet and plain.

CHORUS
Happy hours at home! (Happy hours at home!)
Happy hours at home! (at home!)
How the momements glide by the bright fireside,
In the happy hours at home.

2.
I sit me down by my own fireside
Where the children sport in glee,
While the clear young voice of our homesheld pride
Makes melody that's dear to me.
And by every art that can charm the heart,
They alure cares away,
To prepare my soul as the swift hours rail,
For the duties of the bright sunning day.

(CHORUS)
