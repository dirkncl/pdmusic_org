"Somebody's Coming to See Me Tonight" (1864)
Ballad.
Words by Geprge Cooper, 1838-1927.
By the late
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864.

1.
Somebody's coming to see me tonight;
Somebody's fair and his eyes they are bright,
Softly he speaks and his words they are dear;
Soon as the stars are out he will be here.

CHORUS
Somebody's coming to see me tonight,
Somebody'll meet him with joy and delight.

2.
Somebody's coming to see me tonight,
Somebody's presence is dear to my sight.
Somebody's cheeks are as red as the rose,
Somebody's sorry when somebody goes.

(CHORUS)

3.
Somebody's oftentimes given me a kiss;
Somebody'll meet me enraptured with bliss,
Somebody says I'm the joy of his life
And soon I'm to be that somebody's wife.

(CHORUS)
