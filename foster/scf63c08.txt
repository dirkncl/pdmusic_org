"While We Work for the Lord" (1863)
Written and composed
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
All around is bright and fair
  While we work for the Lord;
Joy and peace are ev'ry where
  While we work for the Lord;
Over the mountains and the vales,
Softly sigh the pleasant gales,
Breathing nature's hymns of gladness
  While we work for the Lord.

CHORUS
All around is bright and fair,
Joy and peace are every where;
Let our heart be free from care
  While we work for the Lord.

2.
Every face with pleasure beams
  While we work for the Lord;
Every heart with rapture teems
  While we work for the Lord;
All the shades of sorrow fly,
Years will never dim the sky,
Light and gladness shine around us
  While we work for the Lord.

(CHORUS)

3.
Nearer seem those realms above
  While we work for the Lord;
Dearer seems our Saviour's love
  While we work for the Lord;
Let us raise a grateful voice,
And with earnest hearts rejoice,
For the happiness around us,
  While we work for the Lord.

(CHORUS)
