Foster's Melodies, No. 29
"Some Folks" (1855)
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Some folks like to sigh,
Some folks do, some folks do;
Some folks long to die,--
But that's not me nor you.

CHORUS
Long live the merry merry heart
  That laughs by night and day,
Like the Queen of Mirth, --
  No matter what some folks say.

2.
Some folks fear to smile,
  Some folks do, some folks do;
Others laugh through guile,--
  But that's not me nor you.

(CHORUS)

3.
Some folks fret and scold,
  Some folks do, some folks do;
They'll soon be dead and colk,--
  But that's not me nor you.

(CHORUS)

4.
Some folks get grey hairs,
  Some folks do, some folks do,
Brooding o'er their cares,--
  But that's not me nor you.

(CHORUS)

5.
Some folks toil and save,
  Some folks do, some folks do,
To buy themselves a grave,--
  But that's not me nor you.

(CHORUS)
