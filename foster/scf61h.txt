"Why Have My Loved Ones Gone?"
Ballad
Words and Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Why have my loved ones gone,
Like the dew 'neath the early sun?
Why am I left alone,
While all their troubles here are done?
My days of youth have passed away
And the shades of life are near,
But I still remain to mourn the happy days
When departed friends were here.

CHORUS
Why have my lov'd ones gone,
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a Summer sea
Whiltst I'm left plodding on the shore?

2.
Why have my lov'd ones gone,
From the joys and the pains of life?
Why do I still live on,
Alone to battle in the strife?
Alone to struggle in the fray,
Till my earthly cares are done;
While the young, the fair have vanish'd from the day,
Before their sorrows had begun.

(CHORUS)

3.
Why have my lov'd ones gone,
While the Springtime is on the breeze?
Gilding the hill side farm,
And breathing music thro' the trees!
The birds are singing in the air,
And the flow'rs are in bloom;
All the things around are beautified fair,
But still my spirit lies in gloom.

(CHORUS)
