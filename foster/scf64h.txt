"When Dear Friends Are Gone" (1864)
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Happy hearts may feel no gloom,
Though the night comes on;
But our brightest joys are clouded,
When dear friends are gone;
The fairest hopes may live,
And around the spirit play;
Though dark low'ring vapors throw,
A shadow o'er the day;

But our joys are quickly flow'n,
And the heart droops alone,
All our hopes are drap'd in sadness,
When dear friends are gone.


2.
Let us turn from grief to mirth,
Brighter days will come;
We can make each other happy,
With sweet smiles at home;
This life is all a change,
Like a fickle April day;
'Tis sunshine then shower
Now we grieve and then we're gay

Yet our joys are quickly flow'n
And the heart droops alone,
All our hopes are drap'd in sadness,
When dear friends are gone.
