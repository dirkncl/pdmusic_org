1.
Sweetly she sleeps, my Alice fair,
Her cheek on the pillow pressed,
Sweetly she sleeps, while her Saxon hair,
Like sunlight, streams o'er her breast.
Hush! let her sleep! I pray, sweet breeze, --
Breathe low on the maple bough!
Hush! bright bird, on her window-trees!
For sweetly she sleepeth now.
Sweetly she sleeps, my Alice fair,
Her cheek on the pillow pressed,
Sweetly she sleeps, while her Saxon hair,
Like sunlight, streams o'er her breast.

2.
Sweetly she sleeps, my Alice fair,
Her cheek like the first May rose,
Sweetly she sleeps, and all her care
Is forgotten in soft repose.
Hush! though the earliest beams of light
Their wings in the blue sea dip,
Let her sleep, I pray, while her dreams are bright,
And a smile is about her lip.
Sweetly she sleeps, my Alice fair,
Her cheek on the pillow pressed,
Sweetly she sleeps, while her Saxon hair,
Like sunlight, streams o'er her breast.
