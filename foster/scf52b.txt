"The Hour for Thee & [and] Me" (1852)
Duet
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
When day breaks forth on the dewy lawn,
And all seems mirth and glee,
When birds their sweetest songs awake
Is the hour for thee and me --
The hour for thee and me --
The hour for thee and me,
The hour for thee and me --
When birds their sweetest songs awake
Is the hour for thee and me.

2.
When perfumes from the closing flowers
Are wafted o'er the lea,
And vespers float upon the gale,
Is the hour for thee and me,
The hour for thee and me,
The hour for thee and me,
When verspers float upon the gale
Is the hour for thee and me.

3.
When night beholds her starry realm
Reflected, on the sea,
When moon-beams dance upon the rill,
Is the hour for thee and me,
Is the hour for thee and me,
Is the hour for thee and me,
When moon-beams dance upon the rill
Is the hour for thee and me.
