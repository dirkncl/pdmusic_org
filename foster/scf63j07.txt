"Seek and Ye Shall Find" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Who had our Redeemer heard,
  Whose voice was good and kind?
Thus He spoke in holy word:
  Seek and ye shall find.

CHORUS
Ask and it shall be given,
  Seek and ye shall find,
Ev'ry pray'r is heard in heaven
  That is breathed from a truthful mind.

2.
Come with gentle, contrite heart,
  And seek the Saviour's grace,
Come, that when from earth we part,
  We'll meet Him face to face.

(CHORUS)

3.
Every prayer is heard above
  That we sincerely feel,
Every sigh received with love,
  When we repenting kneel.

(CHORUS)

4.
Life to all our Lord has shown,
  Then be to hope resigned,
When around you doubts are thrown,
  "Seek and ye shall find."
