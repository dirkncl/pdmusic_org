Song & Chorus
Words by
George Cooper, Esq., 1838-1927
Music Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
The blue bird is singing his lay,
  To all the sweet flow'rs of the dale,
The wild bee is roaming at play,
  And softly is the sigh of the gale;
I stray by the brookside alone,
  Where oft we have wander'd before,
And weep for my love'd one, my own,
  My Willie has gone to the war!

CHORUS
Willie has gone to the war,
  Willie, Willie my lov'd one my own;
Willie has gone to the war,
  Willie, Willie my lov'd one is gone!

2.
'Twas here, where the lily bells grow,
  I last saw his noblw young face,
And now while he's gone to the foe,
  Oh! dearly I love the old place;
The whispering waters repeat
  The name that I love o'er and o'er,
And daisies that nod at my feet,
  Say Willie has gone to the war!

(CHORUS)

3.
The leaves of the forest will fade,
  The roses will whither and die,
But spring to our home in the glade,
  On fairy like pinnions will fly;
And still I will hopefully wait
  The day when these battles are o'er,
And pine like a bird for its mate,
  Till Willie comes home from the war!

(CHORUS)
