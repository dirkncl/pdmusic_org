"Onward and Upward!" (1863)
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Onward and upward our watchword shall be,
While we are laboring, Jesus, for thee;
Never depsonding, for thou art our Guide,
Pleasantly leading us over life's tide.

CHORUS
Onward and upward! onward and upward!
Ever our glorious watchword shall be;
Onward and upward! onward and upward!
While we are laboring, Jesus for thee.

2.
Calling thy children in flocks to thy fold,
Teach them thy kindness, more precious than gold,
Saviour, O, drive from the mind and the heart
Every dark shadow that sin can impart.

(CHORUS)

3.
Watchful and earnest in all that we do,
We will be faithful and we will be true;
Kindness to others we ever will show,
Loving our enemies while here below.

(CHORUS)

4.
Strengthen us, Lord, that we never grow weak;
Teach us thy heavenly pathway to seek;
Leading us on till out journey is past,
Taking us home to thy bosom at last.

(CHORUS)
