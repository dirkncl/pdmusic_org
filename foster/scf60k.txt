Foster's Melodies No. 51.
"Virginia Belle" (1860)
Song
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Fairer than the golden morning,
  Gentle as the tongue can tell,
Was our little laughing darling,
  Sweet Virginia Belle.

CHORUS
Bright Virginia Belle!
Our dear Virginia Belle!
  She bereft us
  When she left us.
Sweet Virginia Belle!

2.
How we used to roam together
  O'er the mountain, through the dell,
In the smiles of spring time weather, --
  Sweet Virginia Belle!

(CHORUS)

3.
She was lythe as any fairy,
  Winning hearts with fairy spell,
Tripping with a footstep airy, --
  Sweet Virginia Belle!

(CHORUS)

4.
While her life was in its morning
  Came a sad and solemn knell,
She was taken without warning, --
  Sweet Virginia Belle!

(CHORUS)
