1.
Lubly Melinda, come now my dear,
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you.
Shut down de window, dry up the tear,
And walk wid me ober de dew.

CHORUS 2 times
Lubly Melinda, Melinda, Melinda, my sweet Melinda May!
I could work in de field and be happy all de day,
If you would only smile again, my sweet Melinda May.

2.
Laugh in de sunshine, weep in de rain,
And walk wha de lily bud bloom,
Down in de meadow, ober de lane,
Oh! come, my Melinda lub, come.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Lubly Melinda is bright as de beam,
No snow-drop was ebber more fair,
She smiles like de roses dat bloom round de stream,
And sings like de birds in de air.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
If I was a hero and people would fall
Where ebber I'd tell dem to lie,
I'd make my Melinda de queen ob dem all,
And lib on delight ob her eye.

(CHORUS 2 times)
