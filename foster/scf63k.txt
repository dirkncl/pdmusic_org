"While the Bowl Goes Round" (1863)
Song & Chorus
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
In the bosom dwells no sigh,
While the goblet's brimming high
All the world if filled with treasure
While the bowl goes round,
Darkling sorrows take their flight
In the wine's rich ruby light,
And the hours are winged with pleasures
While the bowl goes round.

CHORUS
While the bowl goes round
While the bowl goes round
We'll all be jolly fellows
While the bowl goes round.

2.
Sweeter for the fair one smiles,
Dearer all her pleasing wiles
And the many joys she brings us
While the bowl goes round,
Gleefully the wine we sip
With her name upon each lip,
And no blighting sadness stings us
While the bowl goes round.

(CHORUS)

3.
Who would shun the social board,
Fly the place where mirth is stored
And the jocund song is ringing
While the bowl goes round,
Here we join the merry band
Here we grasp the friendly hand,
Golden pleasures ever bringing
While the bowl goes round.

(CHORUS)
