"We Are Coming Father Abraam 300,000 More" (1862)
Song and Chorus.
Words by James Sloane Gibbons
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We are coming, Father Abraam, three hundred thousand more,
From Mississsippi's winding stream and from New England's shore;
We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear,
With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear;
We dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before,

REFRAIN
We are coming, Father, Abraam, three hundred thousand more!

CHORUS
We are coming, coming, our union to restore
We are coming, Father Abraam, with three hundred thousand more,

2.
If you look across the hilltops that meet the northern sky,
Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;
And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy veil aside,
And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride;
And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour,

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
If you look all up our valleys, where the growing harvest shine,
You may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming into line;
And children from their mother's knees are pulling at the weeds,
And learning how to reap and sow, against their country's needs;
And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door,

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide,
To lay us down for freedom's sake, our brother's bones beside;
Or from foul treason's savage group, to wrench the murd'rous blade,
And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade;
Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before,

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
