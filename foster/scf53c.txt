"Annie My Own Love" (1853)
Song
Poetry by Charles P. Shivas
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
There's a wound in my spirit,
  No halm can o'er heal;
In my soul is a sorrow,
  No voice can reveal.
And deeper the furrows
  Will sink on my brow,
For Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from me now,

For Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from my now.

2.
Like the moon to the twilight
  She came to my heart,
And fondly she told me
  We never should part;
By Death, unrelenting,
  She's freed from her vow,
And Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from me now,

And Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from me now.

3.
Like the night when the moonbeam
  Is gone from the sky,
In the gloom of my sorrow
  Heart-broken I lie:
Oh! seek not to sooth me,
  To earth let me bow,
For Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from me now.

For Annie, my own love,
  Is gone from me now.
