"Bring Back My Brother to Me" (1863)
Written by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Bring my brother back to me,
  When this war is done,
Give us all the joys we shar'd
  Ere it had begun
O bring my brother back to me,
  Never more to stray.
This is all my earnest prayer,
  Thro' the weary day.

CHORUS
Bring him back! bring him back!
  With his smiling healthful glee,
Bring him back! bring him back!
  Bring my brother back to me.

2.
All the house is lonely now,
  And my voice no more,
In the pleasant summer eves
  Greets him at the door.
Never more I hear his step
  By the garden gate,
While I sit in anxious tears
  Knowing not his fate.

(CHORUS)

3.
Bring my brother back to me,
  Fro the battle strife,
Thou who watchest o'er the good
  Shield his precious life.
When this war has passed away,
  Safe from all alarms
Bring my brother home again,
  To my longing arms.

(CHORUS)
