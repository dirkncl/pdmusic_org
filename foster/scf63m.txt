1.
Old Uncle Abram wants us, and we're coming right along
  I tell you what it is, we're gwine to muster mighty strong
Then fare you well my honey dear! now dont you be afraid
  I's bound to be a soldier in de colored brigade

CHORUS
A soldier! a soldier in de darkey brigade!
I's bound to be a soldier in de colored bridage.

2.
O! when we meed de enemy I s'pect we make 'em stare,
  I tink he'll catch a tartar when he meets de woolly hair.
We'll fight while we are able and in greenbacks we'll be paid,
  And soon I'll be a Colonel in de Colored Brigade.

CHORUS
A Colonel! A Colonel in de darkey Brigade,
And soon I'll be a Colonel in de Colored Brigade!

3.
Wid musket on my shoulder and wid banjo in my hand,
  For Union, and de Constitution as it was I stand.
Now some folks tink de darkey for dis fighting was'nt made,
  We'll show dem what's de matter in de Colored Brigade!

CHORUS
De matter! De matter in de darkey Brigade,
We'll show dem what's de matter in the Colored Brigade!

4.
In days ob Gen'ral Washington we fought de British well,
  Behind de bales wid "Hickory" I tink we made 'em yell.
I tell you we're de chickens dat can handle gun or spade,
  And Greeley he'll go wid us in de Colored Brigade.

CHORUS
Go wid us! Go wid us in de darkey Brigade,
And Greeley he'll go wid us in de Colored Brigade!

5.
Some say dey lub de darkey and dey want him to be free,
  I s'pec dey only fooling and dey better let him be.
For him dey'd brake dis Union which de're forefadders hab made,
  Worth more dan twenty millions ob de Colored Brigade.

CHORUS
Dan millions! Dan millions of de darkey Brigade,
Worth more dan twenty millions of be Colored Brigade!

6.
Den cheer up now my honey dear I hear de trumpets play,
  And gib me just a little buss before I go away.
I'll marry you when I come back so dont you be afraid,
  We'll raise up picanninnies for de Colored Brigade.

CHORUS
Ninnies! Ninnies for de darkey Brigade,
We'll raise up picanninnies for de Colored Brigade!
