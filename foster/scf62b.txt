"I Will Be True to Thee" (1862)
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I will be true to thee
  Though I share in thy worst despair,
I will be true to thee,
  Though my own heart be bowed with care.
Though cold neglect upon thy hopes may fall,
Though fears of death may never near thy soul,
Though funeral knells upon thine ears may toll,
  Yet I will be true to thee,
  I will be true to thee,
  I will be true to thee.

2.
I will be true to thee,
  Though I roam in a far off land,
Whether on earth or sea,
  In a bower or desert strand,
Though darkest clouds may mar the morning beams,
And vapors dull may settle on the streams,
Though blighting Time destroy thy fondest dreams,
  Yet I will be true to thee.
  I will be true to thee,
  I will be true to thee.

3.
I will be true to thee;
  I will pray for thee night and day;
Wilt thou be true to me,
  As in years that have rolled away?
When all thy childhood's dearest hopes have fled
And gloomy visions linger round thy head,
When all thy dear and early friends are dead,
  Then I will be true to thee.
  I will be true to thee,
  I will be true to thee.
