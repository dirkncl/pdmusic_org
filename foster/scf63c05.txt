"Don't Be Idle" (1863)
Words by Mrs. Mary Ann Kidder
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1863-1864

1.
Don't be idle little children
  While there's so much work to do;
God has planted you a vinyard
  And his laborers yet are few;

CHORUS 
Rise up early in the morning.
  While the air is soft and cool,
And with heart and mind and spririt
  Labor for the Sunday School.
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Make these words your guiding rule;
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Labor for the Sunday School.

2.
God had given you a mission,
  Little children, small and weak,
Sermons you can preach for Jesus
  Though your tongues can scarely speak;

CHORUS
"Love each other," fondly, dearly,
  Learn be heart the golden rule,
Thus in heart and mind and spirit
  Labor for the Sunday School.
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Make these words your guiding rule;
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Labor for the Sunday School.

3.
Don't be idle! in the highways,
  And the hedges, many roam,
Precious lambs without a shepherd,
  Go and call the wanderers home;

CHORUS
Tell them of your heavenly Father,
  Have you love his gentle rule,
And in heart and mind and spirit
  Labor for the Sunday School.
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Make these words your guiding rule;
Don't be idle, don't be idle,
  Labor for the Sunday School.
