"Why No One to Love?" (1862)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
No one to love in this beautiful world,
Full of warm hearts and bright beaming eyes?
Where is the lone heart that nothing can find
That is lovely beneath the blue skies;
  No one to love!
  No one to love!
  Why one to love?
What have you done in this beautiful world,
That you're sighing of no one to love?

2.
Dark is the soul that has nothing to dwell on!
How sad must its brightest hours prove!
Lonely the dull brooding spirit must be
That has no one to cherish and love.
  No one to love!
  No one to love!
  Why one to love?
What have you done in this beautiful world,
That you're sighing of no one to love?


3.
Many a fair one that dwells on the earth
Who would greet you with kind words of cheer,
Many who gladly would joing in your pleasures
Of share in your grief with a tear.
  No one to love!
  No one to love!
  Why one to love?
Where have you roamed in this beautiful world,
That you're sighing of no one to love?
