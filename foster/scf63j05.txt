"He Leadeth Me Beside Still Waters" (1863)
Words by Joseph Gilmore
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
"He leadeth me," oh! blessed thought!
Oh! words with heavenly comforts fraught,
Whate'er I do, wher'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

CHORUS
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand he leadeth me.


3.
Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur or repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since, 'tis God'd hand that leadeth me.

(CHORUS)

4.
And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the victory's won:
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

(CHORUS)
