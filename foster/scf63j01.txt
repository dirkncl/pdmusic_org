"The Beautiful Shore" (1863)
Words by Mrs. O. S. Matteson
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
There's a beautiful shore where the lov'd ones are gone
  'Mid the flow'rs decked in evergreen bloom,
And we knew they have crossed o'er the dark death wave,
  And they dwell in that bright angel home;
They have fought the good fight, and the faith have kept,
  And they join in the angel throng,
And the soft melting notes of the chorus above
  In beauty is borne along.

CHORUS
There's a beautiful shore where the loved ones are gone,
A beautiful shore where the love'd ones are gone.

2.
Oh, that beautiful shore where the lov'd ones are gone,
  And the flow'rs and the evergreen trees,
We shall see when the death-damp is on our brow,
  And the breath faintly dies on the breeze;
We shall meet the loved ones who have gone before,
  And have bloomed in the world of souls,
When our spirits shall pass to that bright, happy shore,
  Our bodies, the tomb below.

(CHORUS)

3.
To that beautiful shore where the loved ones are gone,
  To the flowers and the evergreen glade,
We shall one day pass, like the brave of yore,
  And bask in the beautiful shade,
We must bear the good part, must not shrink from toil,
  Till the plot shall bear us o're,
To the union of hearts in the land of the blest,
  Where parting shall come no more.
