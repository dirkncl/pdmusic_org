1.
Oh! ladies dont you wonder
When I again appear:
I've just been ober yonder
To see my Dolcy dear;
For Dolcy steps so lighly
Among de bricks and stones,
Her eyes dey shine so brightly
Oh! dadda, D' D' Dolcy Jones!

CHORUS
Bye, bye, my darling!
Sleep to de rattle ob de bones!
Slumber till morning,
My lubly Dolcy Jones!

2.
Oh! when I go a courting
I ride thr'o mud and rain;
I leabe de old hoss snorting
At de corner ob de lane.
I find my Dolcy weeping,
And charm her wid de bones,
Bye'n bye I leabe her sleeping,
Oh! dadda, D' D' Dolcy Jones!

(CHORUS)

3.
I went up town dis morning
To sing a little song;
Miss Dolcy send me warning
To bring my boots along;
For de yard is paved wid cinder,
And de house is built ob stones
And a head is at de window,
Oh! dadda, D' D' Dolcy Jones!

(CHORUS)
