"Bury Me in the Morning, Mother" (1863)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Lay me down where the grass is green, mother,
  Beneath the willow shade,
Where the murmuring winds will mourne, mother,
  The wreck that death has made.

CHORUS
Bury me in the morning,
  And mourn not at my loss,
For I'll join the beautiful army
  That carried the Saviour's cross.

2.
Never sorrow or sigh for me, mother,
  Tho' I fall in early years,
For I'll be in the pleasant land,
  That's free from grief and tears.

(CHORUS)

3.
I have heard the songs of the blest, mother,
  And angels are drawing near
To carry me o'er the stream, mother,
  That mortals dread and fear.

(CHORUS)

4.
You must promise to come to me, mother,
  When life and hope shall fade,
For there's room for you in the home, mother,
  That's far from the greenwood shade.

(CHORUS)
