Song.
Written and Composed by

1.
While in their sunny bowers,
Sweet birds rejoice,
Mingling with budding flowers,
Loves gentle voice,
Grief, to thy memory Tuneth a lay,
Lovely departed one,
Sweet Lily Ray --
Lovely departed one,
Sweet Lily Ray.

2.
When slumber's dreamy light
O're me is thrown,
Calling in visions bright,
Days that are gone,
While round my drooping heart,
Joy seems to play,
Fondly I dream of thee,
Sweet Lily Ray --
Fondly I dream of thee,
Sweet Lily Ray.

3.
When liquid melody
Falls on mine ear,
Then I impulsively
Deem thou art near;
But when a gentle form
Passeth away,
Sadly I mourn for thee,
Sweet Lily Ray --
Sadly I mourn for thee,
Sweet Lily Ray.
