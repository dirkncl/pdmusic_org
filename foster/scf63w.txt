"The Soldier's Home" (1863)
Written by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
The weary soldier reaches home at pleasant eventide,
He fondly kisses those he loves, all gath'ring by his side.
His gentle wife is ling'ring near, his boy is on his knee,
Bequiling evening's tranquil joys, with childhood's prattling glee.

CHORUS
How happy is the soldier to be once more at home!
But sorrow falls on those he loves when parting times has come.

2.
O! joyful is the soldier's heart to be once more at home,
To meet his wife and children dear and cease awhile to roam,
What bliss beneath his cottage roof with Hope and Love and cheer,
To pass the happy moments by with all that life holds dear.

(CHORUS)

3.
But hark! the drum; it loudly beats upon the ear of night,
It calls to arms! wake! comrade wake! and rally for the fight!
The soldier's joy is over now for 'mid the battle's roar;
'Mid clanging steel and hissing ball he sleeps forevermore.

(CHORUS)
