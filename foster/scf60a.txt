Foster's Melodies No. 42
"None Shall Weep a Tear for Me" (1860)
Song
Written by Richard Henry Wilde
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
My life is like the summer rose
That opens to the morning sky,
But, e'er the shades of evening close,
Is scattered on the ground to die;
Yet on the rose's humble head
The sweetest dews of night are shed,
As if they wept the waste to see,
But none shall weep a tear for me,
But none shall weep a tear for me,
But none shall weep, shall weep a tear for me.


2.
My life is like the autumn leaf
That trembles in the moon's pale ray;
Its hold is frail, its date is brief,
Tis restless to pass away;
Yet when that leaf shall fall and fade
The parent tree will mourn its shade
The winds bewail leafless tree,
But none shall breathe a sigh for me,
But none shall breathe a sigh for me,
But none shall breathe, shall breathe a sigh for me.
