"What Does Every Good Child Say?" (1867)
Poetry by a Friend
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
What does every good child say,
When it wakes at peep of day?
"Jesus, bless-ed Saviour, keep me
Safe from harm, I humbly pray,"
Jesus answers, "I'll be near thee.
I'll protect thee, I will cheer thee,
When thou prayest I will hear thee:
I will keep thee safe this day."

CHORUS
Jesus, bless-ed Saviour,
keep us safe from harm, I humbly pray.

2.
What does every good child say,
When at school on Sabbath day?
"Jesus, bless-ed Saviour, teach me,
How a little child should pray,"
Jesus answers, "While thou'rt pleading,
I for thee am interceding,
God thy infant prayer is heeding,
He will teach thee how to pray."

(CHORUS)

3.
What does every good child say,
When the daylight fades away?
"Jesus Blessed Saviour keep me,
While I sleep this night I pray."
Jesus answers, "While thou'rt sleeping,
Little child, my watch I'm keeping:
Till the morning light comes peeping,
By thy bedside I will stay."

(CHORUS)
