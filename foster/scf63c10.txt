"The Bright Hills of Glory" (1863)
Words by Mrs. Mary Ann Kidder
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
To the fair shores of Eden,
  My soul longs to fly;
And to drink from the fountain
  That never runs dry;
Where the angels are singing
  The same precious story;
That will ever resound
  Through the bright hills of glory.

CHORUS
O take me my Saviour,
  To join the happy song,
In the bright hills of glory,
  Where the angels belong,
O take me my Saviour,
  To join the happy song,
In the bright hills of glory,
  Where the angels belong.

2.
Oh! what visions of beauty
  Will burst on my sight;
As I enter the mansions
  Of heavenly delight;
How the loved ones will greet me
  From life's troubled story,
And will welcome me home
  To the bright hills of glory!

(CHORUS)

3.
Pray tell me ye watchmen
  Who stand at the gate,
How long must I linger
  In sorrow--and wait?
When I hear the sweet angels
  Rehearsing the story,
And my spirit is longing
  For the bright hills of glory!

(CHORUS)
