Song
Written by William Henry McCarthy
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Deal with me kindly,
Cheer my young heart,
I'll follow thee blindly
wherever thoug art,
Deep in the mountain
Far from home
I'll follow thy path
wherever thou'lt roam.
Thy way shall still be mine
My heart shall still be thine --
  Deal with me kindly,
  Cheer my young heart,
  I'll follow thee blindly
  And never depart.

2.
Break not my spirit,
Think of my youth,
Cherish my tender heart,
Doubt no my truth;
Friends may desert thee,
Sorrows may come,
But still in this soul
Thine image will bloom.
Thy hopes with thee I'll share,
Thy wants shall be my care;--
  Deal with me kindly,
  Cheer my young heart,
  I'll follow thee blindly
  And never depart.

3.
Though through the desert
wand'ring afar,
Still to me dearest one,
Thou'lt be my star;
Sunlight or moonlight
O'er us may shine,
Yet living on love,
I'll ever be thine.
Thy hand shall be my guard.
Thy voice shall be my word;--
  Deal with me kindly,
  Cheer my young heart,
  I'll follow thee blindly
  And never depart.
