"The White House Chair" (1856)
Words and Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Come all ye men of every state,
  Our creed is broad and fair;
Butchanan is our candidate,
  And we'll put him in the White House Chair.

CHORUS
Then come ye men from ev'ry state,
  Our creed is broad and fair;
Butchanan is our candidate,
  And we'll put him in the White House Chair.

2.
Let all our hearts for union be,
  For the North and South are one;
They've worked to gether manfully,
  And together they will work on.

(CHORUS)

3.
We'll have no dark designing band
  To rule with secret sway;
We'll give to all a helping hand,
  And be open as the light of day.

(CHORUS)

4.
We'll not outlaw the land that holds
  The bones of Washington;
Where Jackson fought and Marion bled,
  And the battles of the brave were won.

(CHORUS)
