"Nelly Was a Lady" (1849)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Down on de Mississippi floating,
  Long time I trabble on de way,
All night de cottonwood a toting,
  Sing for my true-lub all de day.

CHORUS
Nelly was a lady,
Last night she died,
Toll de bell for lubly Nell,
My dark Viginny bride.

2.
Now I'm unhappy and I'm weeping,
  Can't tote de cotton-wood no more;
Last night, while Nelly was a sleeping,
  Death came a knockin' at de door.

(CHORUS)

3.
When I say Nelly in de morning,
  Smile till she open'd up her eyes,
Seem'd like de light ob day a dawning,
  Jist 'fore de sun begin to rise.

(CHORUS)

4.
Close by de margin ob de water,
  Whar de lone weeping willow grows,
Dar lib'd Virginny's lubly daughter;
  Dar she in death may find repose.

(CHORUS)

5.
Down in de meadow 'mong de clober,
  Walk wid my Nelly by my side;
Now all dem happy days am ober,
  Farewell, my dark Virginny bride.

(CHORUS)
