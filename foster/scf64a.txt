1.
Oh! all of you poor single men,
  Don't ever give up in despair,
For there's always a chance while there's life
  To capture the hearts of the fair,
No matter what may be you age,
  You always may cut a fine dash,
You will suit all the girls to a hair
  If you've only got a moustache,
    A moustache, a moustache,
    If you've only got a moustache.

2.
No matter for manners or style,
  No matter for birth or for fame,
All these _used_ to have something to do
  With young ladies changing their name,
There's no reason now to despong,
  Or go and do any thing rash,
For you'll do though you can't raise a cent,
  If you've only raise a moustache!
    A moustache, a moustache,
    If you've only raise a moustache.

3.
Your head may be thick as a block,
  And empty as any foot-ball,
Oh! your eyes may be green as the grass
  Your heart just as hard as a wall.
Yet take the advice that I give,
  You'll soon gain affection and cash,
And will be all the rage with the girls,
  If you've only get a moustache,
    A moustache, a moustache,
    If you've only get a moustache.

4.
I once was in sorrow and tears
  Because I was jilted you know,
So right down to the river I ran
  To quickly dispose of my woe,
A good friend he gave me advice
  And timely prevented the spash,
Now at home I've a wife and ten heirs,
  And all through a handsome moustache,
    A moustache, a moustache,
    And all through a handsome moustache,
