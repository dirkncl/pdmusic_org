"Jenny's Coming O'er the Green" (1860)
Ballad.
Written and Composed expressly
for Clark's School Visitor,
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Jenny's coming o'er the green,
Fairer form was never seen,
Winning is her gentle mien;--
  Why do I love her so?
We have wandered side by side
O'er the meadows far and wide;
Little Jenny's full of pride,--
  Why do I love her so?

2.
Jenny's calm and liquid eyes
Sometimes bring a sweet suprise,
Like a change in summer skies;--
  Why do I love her so?
Oft her voice, so full of glee,
Wakes the saddest memory;
She is younger far than me,--
  Why do I love her so?

3.
Little Jenny never fears,
Hoping all from coming years,
Dashing off the passing tears;--
  Why do I love her so?
Can I not another find
With her sweet endearing mind,
None--with Jenny's charms combined?
  Why do I love her so?
