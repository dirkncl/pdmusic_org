"We'll Tune Our Hearts" (1863)
Words and Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864
[Note: same music used for
"The Pure, the Bright, the Beautiful"]

1.
We'll tune our hearts to harmony
  In praise of Him who died,
That we might not be cast away;
  Our Saviour and our guide.
His ways were full of gentleness,
  His voice brought peace and love,
And if we keep his holy word,
  We'll hear that voice above.

CHORUS
We'll tune our hearts to harmony
  In praise of Him who died,
That we might not be cast away;
  Our Saviour and our guide.

2.
He quietly received affronts,
  As gently as a child,
And pitied those who could assault,
  A soul so pure and mild.
And when He chided, 'twas in grief,
  That we should sinful be;
Then raise our voices to the Lord
  In grateful harmony.

(CHORUS)
