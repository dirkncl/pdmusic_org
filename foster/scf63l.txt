1.
Did you ever see dear Jenny June
When the meadows were in tune
  With the birds among the bowers
    In the sweet summer time
You would love her I am sure
For her heart is warm and pure
  And as guiless as the flowers
    In the sweet summer time.

2.
All the robbins cease their song
As she gaily speeds along
  Just to listen to her singing
    In the sweet summer time.
Ahd her modest beaming eyes
Are the color of the skies
  Many pleasant fancies bringing
    In the sweet summer time.

3.
With my darling Jenny June
When the meadows are in tune
  How I love to go a roving
    In the sweet summer time
While her presence seems to be
Like a ray of light to me
  For she's ever fond and loving
    In the sweet summer time.
