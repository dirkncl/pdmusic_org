"Once I Loved Thee, Mary Dear" (1851)
Song
Written by William Cullen Crookshank
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Once I loved thee, Mary dear,
  O how truly!
As the dewdrop bright and clear,
  Born but newly,
Sparkling in the solar rays,
To the rosebud's beauty, pays
  Tribute duly,
      Tribute duly.
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!

2.
I loved thee, when in early youth
  Lovely ever --
Virtuous pride and honest truth
  Ne'er could sever,
And thy heart was pure and bright
As the early morning's light,
  Sinning never,
     Sinning never.
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!

3.
O that dream hath passed away,
  Passed sadly!
Like a genial summer day,
  Glowing gladly;
And the taste of life is told
Passions blighted, withered, cold --
  Madly, madly,
    Madly, madly,
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!

4.
Once I loved thee, Mary dear --
  Still, God bless thee!
May ever blissful prospects cheer
  And joy caress thee;
Though I drain my cups apart,
May, like mine, a saddened heart
  Ne'er distress thee --
    Ne'er distress thee.
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!

5.
Youth will fleet, and age will come,
  Slowly, slowly;
Death will best its muffled drum,
  Lowly, lowly:
May the passing moments roll
Bliss eternal to thy soul,
  Holy, holy --
    Holy, holy.
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
Once I love thee Mary dear, O how truly!
