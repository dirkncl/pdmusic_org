1.
Way down on de old plantation --
  Dah's where I was born,
I used to beat de whole creation
  Hoein' in de corn:
Oh! den I work and den I sing
  So happy all de day,
Till Angelina Baker came
  And stole my heart away.

CHORUS
Angelina Baker!
  Angelina Baker's gone --
She left me hear to weep a tear
  And beat on de old jawbone.

2.
I've seen my Angelina
  In de spring-time and de fall,
I've seen her in de corn-field
  And I've seen her at de ball;
And ebry time I met her
  She was smiling like de sun,
But now I'm left to weep a tear
  Cayse Angelina's gone.

(CHORUS)

3.
Angelina am so tall
  She nebber sees de ground,
She hab to take a wellumscope
  To look down on de town --
Angelina likes de boys
  As far as she can see dem,
She used to run old Massa round
  To ax him for to free dem.

(CHORUS)

4.
Early in de morning
  Ob a lubly summer day
I ax for Angelina,
  And de say "she's gone away" --
I don't know wha to find her,
  Cayse I don't know wha she's gone,
She left me hear to weep a tear
  And beat on de old jawbone.

(CHORUS)
