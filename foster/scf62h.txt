from "Foster's Melodies, No. 9"
"Merry Little Birds Are We" (1862)
Written and Composed by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
The summer's comming on,
  And we warble in the tree,
The wint'ry blasts have gone,
  Oh! what merry birds are we;
So now we chirp and sing,
  For the sunlight makes us glad,
We've waited for the spring
  Till our hearts were sick and sad.

CHORUS
Merry little birds are we,
  Twit, twit, twee,
  Twit, twit, twee,
Merry little birds are we,
  For the summer days are coming.

2.
The daisy lifts its head
  To the bright and cheering sky,
The snowy flakes have fled,
  And the chilling winds gone by,
The roses soon will roam,
  Oh! we'll all be happy then.

(CHORUS)

3.
We greet the morning beams
  With a welcome to the May,
We carol to the streams
  When we wake at break of day;
The birds are on the bough,
  And the verdure on the plain,
We'll all be happy now,
  For the spring has come again.

(CHORUS)
