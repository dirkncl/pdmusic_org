1. Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

2. The sorrows of the mind
Be banished from the place;
Religion never was designed
To make our pleasures less.

[NOTE: there is no thirds verse]

4. The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.

5. Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We’re marching thro’ Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.
