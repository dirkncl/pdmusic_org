"Molly Dear, Good-Night" (1861)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Molly dear, I cannot linger;
  Let me soon be gone.
Time now points with warning finger
  T'wards the coming dawn.
When the noisy weary day
Shall have toiled its cares away,
To thy side again I'll stray;
  Then Molly dear, good-night!

2.
Smile away the coming morrow
  Till me sure return,
Why should fond hearts part in sorrow?
  Grief too soon we learn.
Hours of bliss must come and go,
Constant pleasures none can know,
Joy must have its ebb and flow;
  Then Molly dear, good-night!

3.
On thy form, with beauty laden,
  All my thoughts will be;
Purer love ne'er blessed a maiden,
  Then I hold for thee;
While thine eyes in beauty glance,
While thy smiles my soul entrance,
Still the fleeting hours advance;
  Then Molly dear, good-night!
