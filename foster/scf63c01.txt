"The Pure, the Bright, the Beautiful" (1863)
Words by Charles Dickens [?]
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864
[Note: same music used for "We'll Tune Our Hearts"]

1.
The pure, the bright, the beautiful,
  That stirred our hearts in youth;
The impulse to a worldless pray'r,
  The dreams of love and truth;
The longings after something lost;
  The spirits yearning cry;
Revivings of our better hopes;
  These things can never die.

CHORUS
The pure, the bright, the beautiful,
  These things can never die.
The pure, the bright, the beautiful,
  These things can never die.

2.
The timid hand stretched forth to aid
  A brother in his need,
The kindly word in grief's dark hour
  That proves a friend indeed,--
The plea for mercy, softly breathed,
  When justice threatens high,
The sorrow of a contrite heart--
  These things can never die.

(CHORUS)

3.
The cruel and bitter word,
  That bounded as it fell;
The chilling want of sympathy,
  We feel, but never tell.
The hard repulse that chills the heart
  Whose hopes were bounding high,
Is an unfading record kept--
  These things can never die.

(CHORUS)

4.
Let nothing pass, for every hand
  Must find some work to do;
Lose not a chance to waken love--
  Be firm, and just, and true,
So shall a light that cannot fade
  Beam on thee from on high,
And angel voices say to thee--
  These things shall never die.

(CHORUS)
