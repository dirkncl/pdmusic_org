"Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
    Father of love,
    Father of love,
Send down they blessing upon each head,
    Shield us from pride,
    While we here bide,
Give us this day our daily bread.

2.
    Humbly we pray,
    Humbly we pray,
Words that our Lord and Redeemer said,
    Trustful and weak,
    Humbly we speak,
Give us this day our daily bread.

3.
    Make us resigned,
    Patient of mind,
While to the throne of Thy grace we're led,
    Make us content
    With what is sent;
Give us this day our daily bread.

4.
    Sinful are we,
    Thoughtless of Thee,
While 'round our footsteps Thy care is shed,
    Though we forget,
    Watch o're us yet;
Give us this day our daily bread.
