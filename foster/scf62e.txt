"That's What's the Matter"
Dan Bryant's Celebrated Song,
As Sung by Him with Great Success.
Written and Composed
(Words and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
We live in hard and stirring times,
Too sad for mirth, too rough for rhymes;
For songs of peace have lost their chimes,
  And that's what's the matter!
The men are held as brothers true,
Have turn'd into a rebel crew;
So now we have to put them thro',
  And that's what's the matter!

CHORUS
That's what's the matter,
The rebels have to scatter;
  We'll make them flee,
  By land and sea,
And that's what's the matter!

2.
Oh! yes, we thought our neighbors true,
Indulg'd them as their mothers do;
They storm'd our bright Red, White and Blue,
  And that's what's the matter!
We'll never give up what we gain,
For now we know we must maintain
Our Laws and Rights with might and main;
  And that's what's the matter!

(CHORUS)
3.
The rebels thought we could divide,
And Democrats would take their side;
They would let the Union slide,
  And that's what's the matter!
But, when the war had once begun,
All party feeling soon was gone;
We join'd as brothers, ev'ry one!
  And that's what's the matter!

(CHORUS)

4.
The Merrimac, with heavy sway,
Had made our Fleet an easy prey--
The Monitor got in the way,
  And that's what's the matter!
So health to Captain Ericsson,
I cannot tell all he has done,
I'd never stop when once begun,
  And that's what's the matter!

(CHORUS)

5.
We've heard of Gen'ral Beauregard,
And thought he'd fight us long and hard;
But he has play'd out his last card,
  And that's what's the matter!
So what's the use to fret and pout,
We soon will hear the people shout,
Seccession dodge is _all_ play'd out!
  And that's what's the matter!
