"Ellen Bayne" (1854)
Words and Music
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Soft be thy slumbers,
  Rude cares depart,
visions in numbers
  Cheer thy young heart.
Dream on while bright hours
  And fond hopes remain,
Blooming like smiling bow'rs
  For thee, Ellen Bayne.

CHORUS
Gentle slumber o'er thee glide,
Dreams of beauty round thee bide
While I linger by thy side,
Sweet Ellen Bayne.

2.
Dream not in anquish,
  Dream not in fear;
Love shall not lanquish;
  Fond ones are near.
Sleeping or waking,
  In pleasure or pain
Warm hearts will beat for thee,
  Sweet Ellen Bayne.

(CHORUS)

3.
Scenes that have vanished
  Smile on thee now,
Pleasures once banished
  Play round thy brow,
Forms long departed
  Greet thee again
Soothing thy dreaming heart,
  Sweet Ellen Bayne.

(CHORUS)
