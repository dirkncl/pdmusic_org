"The Village Maiden" (1855)
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
The village bells are ringing,
  And merrily they chime;
The village choir is singing,
  For 'tis a happy time;
The chapel walls are laden
  With garlands rich and gay,
To greet the village maiden
  Upon her wedding day.

2.
But the summer joys have faded
  And summer hopes have flown;
Her brow with grief is shaded,
  Her happy smiles are gone;
Yet why her heart is laden,
  No one, alas! can say,
Who saw the village maiden
  Upon her wedding day.

3.
The village bells are ringing.
  But hark, how sad and slow;
The village choir is singing
  A requiem soft and low;
And all with sorrow laden
  Their tearful tributes pay
Who saw the village maiden
  Upon her wedding day.
