"Molly Do You Love Me?" (1850)
Song.
Written and Composed
for the
Piano Forte
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Molly do you love me?
  Can the morning beam
Love a lowly flowret
  Living in its gleam?
Let one gentle whisper
  All my doubts destroy --
Let my dreamy rapture
  Turn to waking joy.
Molly do you love me?
  Tell me, tell me true!
Molly do you love me,
  Love as I love you?

2.
Tell me, by these ringlets,
  By those eyes of blue,
Molly! do you love me,
  Love as I love you?
Can that voice's music
  Flow from heartless glee?
Must I read no feeling
  In that melody?
Molly! do you love me?
  Tell me, tell me true!
Molly! do you love me,
  Love as I love you?

3.
Ah! my heart has yielded
  To those smiles that play
With the merry dimples
  All the live-long day.
Though the tender blossoms
  Need the summer light,
Let our hearts, united,
  Brave affliction's blight.
Molly! do you love me?
  Tell me, tell me true!
Molly! do you love me,
  Love as I love you?
