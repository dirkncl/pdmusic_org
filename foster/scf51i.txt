"Oh! Boys, Carry My 'Long" (1851)
A Plantation Melody
Written and Composed (Words and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Oh! carry my 'long;
Der's no more trouble for me;
I's guine to roam
In a happy home
Where all de niggas am free.
I've worked long in de fields;
I've handled many a hoe;
I'll turn my eye,
Before I die,
And see de sugarcane grow.

CHORUS 2 times
Oh! boys, carry my 'long;
Carry me till I die --
Carry me down
To de buryin' groun' --
Massa, dont you cry.

2.
All ober de land
I've wanderd many a day,
To blow de horn
And mind de corn
And Keep de possun away.
No use for me now --
So darkeys bury me low;
My horn is dry,
And I must lie
Wha de possum nebber go.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
Farewell to de boys
Wid hearts so happy and light,
Dey sing a song
De whole day long,
And dance de juba at night.
Farewell in de fields
Ob cotten, 'bacco, and all;
I's guine to hoe
In a bressed row
Wha de corn grows mellow and tall.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
Farewell to de hills,
De meadows covered wid green,
Old brindle Boss
And de old grey hoss
All beaten, broken, and lean.
Farewell to de dog
Dat always followed me round;
Old Sansho'll wail
And droop his tail
When I am under de ground.

(CHORUS 2 times)
