"There's a Land of Bliss" (1853)
Words an Music by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864
[compare "Old Uncle Ned" (1848)]

1.
There's a land of bliss where the weary are at rest
  From their toils and their earthly pain;
And where the cares of the sorrowing breast
  Can never disturb again.
    Then away with earth's cares and its woe.

CHORUS
With your joys and your sorrows below;
  For no more tears from your eyes will be shed,
When you've gone where the santified go,
  For no more tears from your eyes will be shed,
    When you've gone where the sanctified go.

2.
In that beautiful land beyond the tomb,
  By the feet of the blessed trod,
The skies are all bright and the flowers ever bloom,
  'Neath the smiles and the breath of God.
     Then away with earth's cares and its woe.

(CHORUS)

3.
And there with hosannas the saints of light
  Shall sweep their loud harps of gold,
And crowned with glory and robed in white
  The King in His beauty behold.
    Then away with earth's cares and its woe.

(CHORUS)
