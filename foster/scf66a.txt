"Sweet Emerald Isle That I Love So Well" (1866)
Words by George Cooper, 1838-1927
Melody by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
O the dear early days in my own fair land!
In beautiful dreams they come back to me,
And the friends of my boyhood a round me stand,
Though far between us thy deep blue sea,
And the vales and the cottage I left long ago,
Come before me in joy that my lips cannot tell!
But my visions they fade in the morning's red glow,
Sweet Emerald Isle that I love so well!

CHORUS
Sweet Emerald Isle, Sweet Emerald Isle,
The heart in my bosom is all thine own,
Sweet Emerald Isle that I love so well!

2.
O! I wake to thy sorrow my childhood's home;
For shadows are dark o'er thy sacred soil!
And thy [mark?] I am sharing while here I roam,
And so are all of thy sons of toil,
But thy future is brighter in glory thou'll shine;
For thy children are tolling foul tyranny's knell!
Ev'ry wish of my [heart?], land of [beauty?] is thine,
Sweet Emerald Isle that I love so well!

(CHORUS)
