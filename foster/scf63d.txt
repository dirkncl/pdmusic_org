"Suffer Little Children to Come to Me" (1863)
Words and Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1863

1.
What did our Lord and Saviour say
When others wished to drive us away?

CHORUS
"Suffer little children to come unto me,
Of such is the kingdom if heav'n."

2.
What did he say who from above
Came down to teach us kindness and love?

(CHORUS)

3.
What were the words of Him who bled,
Nailed to the cross with thorns on His head?

(CHORUS)

4.
What did He say whose Spirit shed
Hope to the living, life to the dead?

(CHORUS)

5.
If on His mercy we rely,
What will His words be when we die?

(CHORUS)
