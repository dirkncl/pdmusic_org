"Stand Up for the Truth" (1863)
Duett.
Words by J. C.
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Stand up for the truth all your lifetime,
  And never be tempted away;
Stand firm in your duty though others
  May seek you to lead you astray;
Stand firm though companions around you,
  Are yielding to error and sin;
Stand firm, and when this life is over;
  A heavenly crown you will win.

CHORUS [Repeat pp Ad lib.]
Stand up for the truth all your lifetime,
  And never be tempted to sin;
Stand up for the truth all your lifetime,
  A heavenly crown you will win.

2.
Stand up for the truth without falter,
  Though pathways of sin may look bright;
Yet sooner or later they'll plunge you
  In misery "darkness and night."
Stand firm! tho' the tempter revile you,
  Stand firm like and oak in the wood;
No matter what ills may bequile you,
  Stand up for the true and the good.

(CHORUS)

3.
Stand up for the truth! be in earnest;
  Whatever you say or you do;
For this is he noblest of lessons,
  The bible is teaching to you.
Stand firm, all your days, for hearafter,
  Oh! sweet are the joys you will share;
Stand firm! and your Heavenly Father
  Will keep you forever in care.

(CHORUS)
