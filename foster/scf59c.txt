Foster's Melodies No. 40
"For Thee, Love, for Thee" (1859)
Written by William Henry McCarthy
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
I'll watch o'er thy dreams when thou'rt sleeping,
For thee, love, for thee, love,
I'll weep o'er thy cares when thou'rt weeping,
For thee, only thee.
The wild lands of India,
The prairie, the sea
May lure me, but fondly,
I'll still turn to thee,
  For thee, dearest thee
  I would roam night and day,
  And thy love, and thy love
  Would cheer my lone way;
  And thy love, and thy love
  Would cheer my lonely way.

2.
I'll dwell on thy smiles when thou'rt waking,
For thee love, for thee love,
My heart would be faithful though breaking
For thee only thee.
In bowers where we've lingered
Each flowret and tree
Remains in my mem'ry
An emblem of thee
  For thee, dearest thee
  I would roam night and day
  And thy love and thy love
  Would cheer my lone way
  And thy love and thy love
  Would cheer my lone way

3.
The lark and the linet seem singing,
For thee love, for thee love,
The bud into blossom seems springing
For thee only thee.
The bloom on the meadows
The rippling of streams
Recall but the fair form
The queen of my dreams
  For thee, dearest thee
  I would roam night and day
  And thy love and thy love
  Would cheer my lone way
  And thy love and thy love
  Would cheer my lone way
