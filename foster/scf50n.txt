"Turn Not Away!" (1850)
DUETT.
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Turn not away! Turn not away!
  From the fond heart thou hast slighted:
Scorn not my dream, Bright as the beam
  E'er by thy cold frown benighted.
  E'er by thy cold frown benighted.
  E'er by thy cold frown benighted.
Bid me not now, Spurn ev-ry vow,
  Once so confidingly plighted.

2.
Where shall I turn--How can I learn
  Other delights to awaken?
Ne'er can I find Joy for my mind,
  Hope from my heart being taken.
  Hope from my heart being taken.
  Hope from my heart being taken.
Vainly I strive, Hope to revive,
  When by thee scorned and forsaken.

3.
When I would smile, Grief to beguile,
  Peace from my breast has departed,
When I would hide, Anguish in pride,
  Sorrowing tear drops have started:
  Sorrowing tear drops have started:
  Sorrowing tear drops have started:
Turn not away! Turn not away!
  Leave me not now broken hearted!
