(_Say not those happy days
    Can never return!_)
Song
Written & Composed
(Poetry & Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Fondly old memories
Recall round my heart
Scenes of my early joys
That never depart.
Warmed in their sunny rays,
Hopes brightly burn;
Say not those happy days
Can never return!
Say not those happy days
Can never return!

2.
Voices of tenderness
And eyes ever bright,
Warm and true-hearted friends
May lend their delight;
But still for departed smiles
The sad heart will yearn;
Say not those happy days
Can never return!
Say not those happy days
Can never return!
