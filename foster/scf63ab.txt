"The Song of All Songs" (1863)
Words by John F. Poole?
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
As you've walked through the town on a fine summer's day,
The subject I've got, you have seen, I dare say;
Upon fences and railings, where ever you go,
You'll see the penny ballads sticking up, in a row;
The titles to read you may stand for a while,
And some are so odd, they will cause you to smile;
I noted them down as I read them along,
And I've put them together to make up my song.

CHORUS
Old songs! New songs! Ev'ry kind of song,
I noted them down as I read them along.

2.
There was "Abraham's Daughter" "Going out upon a spree,"
With "Old Uncle Snow" "In the Cottage by the sea."
"If your foot is pretty, show it" "At Lanigan's Ball;"
And "Why did she leave him" "On the raging Canawl?"
There was "Bonnie Annie" with "A jockey hat and feather."
"I don't think much of you" "We were boys and girls together."
"Do you think of me at home?" "I'll be free and easy still"
"Give us now a good Commander" with "The Sword of Bunker-Hill."

(CHORUS)

3.
"When this Cruel War is over," "No Irish need apply,"
"For, every thing is lovely, and the Goose hangs high."
"The Young Gal from New-Jersey," "Oh! wilt thou be my bride?"
And "Oft in the Stilly Night" "We'll all take a ride."
"Let me kiss him for his Mother," "He's a Gay Young Gambolier;"
"I going to fight mit Sigel" and "De bully Lager-bier."
"Hunkey Boy is Yankee Doodle," "When the Cannons loudly roar."
"We are coming, Father Abraham, six hundred thousand more!"

(CHORUS)

4.
"In the days when I was hard up" with "My Mary Ann,"
"My Johnny was a Shoemaker," "Or Any other Man!"
"The Captain with his whiskers" and "Annie of the Vale,"
Along with "Old Bob Ridley," "A riding on a Rail!"
"Rock me to sleep, Mother," "Going round the Horn;"
"I'm not myself at all," "I'm a Bachelor forlorn."
"Mother, is the Battle over?" "What are the men about?"
"How are you, Horace Greely?" "Does your Mother know you're out?"

(CHORUS)

5.
"We won't go home till morning," with "The Bold Privateer"
"Annie Lisle" and "Zouave Johnny" "Riding in a Rail-road Kerr;"
"We are coming, Sister Mary," with "The Folks that put on airs."
"We are marching along" with "The Four-and-Thirty Stars."
"On the other side of Jordan" "Don't fly your Kite too high!"
"Jenny's coming o'er the Green," to "Root, Hog or die!"
"Our Union's Starry Banner," "The Flag of Washington,"
Shall float victorious o'er the land, from Maine to Oregon!

(CHORUS)
