"What Shall the Harvest Be?" (1863)
Duett.
Words by Emily Sullivan Oakey
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
They are sowing their seed in the daylight fair;
They are sowing their seed in the noonday glare;
They are sowing their seed in the soft twilight;
They are sowing their seed in the solemn night;

CHORUS
What shall the harvest be,
(What shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be,
What shall the harvest be,
(What shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be?

2.
They are sowing the seed of the word and deed,
Which the careless know not, nor the cold ones heed,
Of the tenderest word of the kindest deed
That have gladdened the heart in its greatest need.

CHORUS
Sweet shall the harvest be,
(Sweet shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be,
Sweet shall the harvest be,
(Sweet shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be.

3.
They are sowing the seed of each noble deed
With an untiring watch, and an earnest heed;
With an unceasing hand, o're the earth they sow,
And the meadows are ripening where they go.

CHORUS
Rich shall the harvest be,
(Rich shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be,
Rich shall the harvest be,
(Rich shall the harvest be,)
The harvest be.

4.
Whether sowing in darkness or sowing in light,
Whether sowing in weakness or sowing in night,
Whether sowing in meekness or sowing in wrath,
In the broad work field or the shadowy path.

CHORUS
True will the harvest be,
(True will the harvest be,)
The harvest be,
True will the harvest be,
(True will the harvest be,)
The harvest be.
