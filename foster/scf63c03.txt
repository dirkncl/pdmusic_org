"Tell Me of the Angels, Mother" (1863)
Written and Composed
by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Tell me of the angels, mother,
  And the radiant land,
Where my gently little brother
  Joined their happy band;
Oh! I seem to hear their voices
  When the night draws near,
And my gladdened soul rejoices
  At their ascents clear.

2.
Tell me of the angels, mother,
  When God bids us come
Shall we dwell with one another
  In their starry home;
Shall we join the tuneful chorus
  Far from all alarms,
With no gloomy shadows o'er us
  In the Saviour's arms.

3.
Tell me of the angels, mother,
  Crowned with chaplets bright,
Singing hymns that sorrow smother
  On their wings of light;
Oh! I long to see them, mother,
  And I long to fly
To my dear departed brother
  In the azure sky.
