"Laura Lee" (1851)
Written and Composed
(Poetry and Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Why has thy merry face
Gone from my side,
Leaving each cherished place
Cheerless and void!
Why has the happy dream,
Blended with thee,
Passed like a flitting beam,
Sweet Laura Lee?
Why has the happy dream,
Blended with thee,
Passed like a flitting beam,
Sweet Laura Lee?

2.
Far from all pleasure torn,
Sad and alone,
How doth my spirit mourn
While thou art gone!
How like a desert isle
Earth seems to me,
Robbed of thy sunny smile,
Sweet Laura Lee!

3.
When will thy winning voice
Breathe on mine ear?
When will my heart rejoice,
Finding thee near?
When will we roam the plain
Joyous and free,
Never to part again,
Sweet Laura Lee?
When will we roam the plain
Joyous and free,
Never to part again,
Sweet Laura Lee?
