Sung by Christy Minstrels
Written & Composed
(Poetry & Music) by
Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
The morn of life is past,
And evening comes at last;
It brings me a dream of a once happy day,
Of merry forms I've seen
Upon the village green,
Sporting with my old dog Tray.

CHORUS
Old dog Tray's ever faithful,
Grief cannot drive him away,
He's gentle, he is kind;
I'll never, never find
A better friend than old dog Tray.

2.
The forms I call'd my own
Have vanished one by one,
The lov'd ones, the dear ones have all passed away,
Their happy smiles have flown,
Their gentle voices gone;
I've nothing left but old but old dog Tray.

(CHORUS)

3.
When thoughts recall the past
His eyes are on me cast;
I know that he feels what my breaking would say;
Although he cannot speak
I'll vainly, vainly seek
A better friend than old dog Tray.

(CHORUS)
