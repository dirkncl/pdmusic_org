Foster's Melodies No. 39
"Linda Has Departed" (1859)
Song
Written by William Henry McCarthy
Composed by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Death with his cold hand,
Hath robbed me of ev'ry hope,
Hath robbed me of ev'ry hope --
My loved one is gone,
Bleak was the moment,
That parted our beating hearts,
That parted our beating hearts,
And left me alone.
Sweet was the low voice,
That wrapt me in fond delight,
That wrapt me in fond delight
As fair visions do,
Soft were the dark eyes,
That lanquished in beauty bright,
That languish'd in beauty bright --
How fondly and true!

CHORUS
Linda has departed,
The warm and tender hearted.
Linda has departed
And left me here to mourn.

2.
Blest were the hours passed,
With her whom my soul adored,
With her whom my soul adored
Whose heart was so light;
Sad is the lone hour,
Bereft of my darling one,
Befeft of my darling one,
In darkness and night.
All now is cheerless,
My joys long have passed away,
My joys long have passed away
With loves fleeting years;
Hope has no comfort,
For sadness now holdeth sway,
For sadness now holdeth sway,
And leaves me in tears.

(CHORUS)
