"Lizzie Dies To-Night" (1861)
Words by Mary Rynon Reese
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
'Twas hard, our parting, mother dear,
  It gave you untold pain;
But hope was strong within our hearts
  That we should meet again;
There's health upon my cheek once more,
  And in my eye new light,
'Twill all be quench'd in ocean's gloom,
  For Lizzie dies to-night!

[REFRAIN]
Lizzie dies to-night, mother,
Lizzie dies to-night!

2.
I'm thinking, mother, of the time
  When little Willie died;
We laid him down with bursting hearts,
  My father's tomb beside.
'Twas then you feared my tender form
  Would vanish from the light,
But ah! my grave is 'neath the wave,
  For Lizzie dies to-night!

(REFRAIN)

3.
I know you're dreaming, mother dear,
  Of all these dangers past;
Perhaps you'll never know how hard
  Death came to me at last.
I'm almost in your arms again,--
  God make your burden light,--
I never more can cheer your heart,
  For Lizzie dies to-night!

(REFRAIN)
