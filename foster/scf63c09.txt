"Choral Harp" (1863)
Words by William Ross Wallace
Music by Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-1864

1.
Murmur on, murmur on, all your melodies sweet,
As the south wind where roses and amaranths meet;
For the emerald home of an innocent dove,
With her breast throbbing bliss, and her song singing love.

CHORUS
Murmur on, (murmur on) sweet harp, sweet harp,
Murmur on, (murmur on) sweet harp, sweet harp,
Murmur on, (murmur on) sweet harp, sweet harp,
Murmur on sweet harp.

2.
Murmur on, murmur on, with your soft Sabbath tone,
Wafting childhood's pure soul to the heavenly throne;
Where he waits who once whispered o're life's troubled sea,
"Suffer dear little children unto me."

(CHORUS)

3.
Murmur on, murmur on, all your sanctified Lore,
Wreathing harmonies over "The Beautiful Shore;"
"Oh 'tis glorious" thus to be soothed by the hymn,
Singing bliss never fading, and stars never dim.

(CHORUS)

4.
Murmur on, murmur on, O thou harp of the Blest,
In our childhood's sweet choir on the dear day of rest;
Murmur on till we sweep thee with those Harps above
That the angels sweep ever for mercy and love.

(CHORUS)
