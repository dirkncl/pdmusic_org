1. I've come from the state of Arkansas
to see the sights dat can be seen,
but-- nothing makes my bosom swell
like a peep at dese here New York gals.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
New York gals
pretty faces
bran new frocks
trimm'd with laces
Anckles smill
waist so slender
ah! ah! ah!
and a good bye John.

2. Dere dey cum wid dere silks and satins,
Turned up hats and short hand mittens,
And for want of nature's muscles
Dey were de doubled breasted bustles.

3. As I was walking along de canal,
O dere I met a New York gal,
Her teeth was white and her eyes did shine,
And her heel stuck out about a foot behind.

4. De oder day as I walked along,
I met my dear Miss Lucy Long,
We stopped a while and had some talk,
And her foot covered up de whole sidewalk.

5. When dey go to eat dere dinners,
Wid dere artificial grinners,
Roasted beef and Oyster flitters,
Wid dere Mineral water blitters.
