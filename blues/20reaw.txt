1.
Old Bill Flat from New Orleans
from New Orleans
Was a high-toned gambling man
Down in New Orleans.
He would take a pair of dice
And get down on the ground.
He'd shoot a buck and then he'd sing
to the bunch that stood around.

CHORUS 2 times
Read 'em and weep ([SPOKEN]_Huh!_)
Look at the seven
Read 'em and weep ([SPOKEN]_Huh!_)
Look at the 'leven
Please now bones don't you hesitate
come on sweet ace make six your mate.
And let these men folks read 'em while they can
([SPOKEN]_Come on to Papa_)
([SPOKEN]_Come on for Mama_)
Read 'em and weep ([SPOKEN]_Huh!_)
Look at the seven
Read 'em and weep ([SPOKEN]_Huh!_)
Look at the 'leven
Stay off of Joe, Mistah Richard and Febe
I'll make 'em Christians befo' I leave,
So come on dice and make 'em read 'em and weep.

2.
Old Bill Flat in New Orleans
in New Orleans
Loved his little game of dice,
Down in New Orleans;
He'd be playing day and night;
And ev'ry time he'd throw.
He'd do a fancy buck and wing,
and just like a roster crow.

(CHORUS 2 times)
