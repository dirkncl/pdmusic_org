VERSE
You've heard of all kinds of blues,
You've heard of blues you can't lose,
You've heard of blues that would make you want to roam
(And never more would you want to [stay?] back home)
I'm not denyin', I'm even cryin',
The blues have got me so bad I'm nearly dyin',
I'm grievin' and heavin' sighs and prayin' ev'ry day
(Oh ? ? ? ? my way)
For here's a new kind of blues,
The kind that I can't excuse,
They're all about the big pay I'll get some day.
(? ? ? ...)
I've borrowed from my dad,
And all my sweetie had,
It's "dough" I'm needin',
And I am needin' bad
(But when I get my [Bonus?] I ? fast so sad)

CHORUS [repeat twice]
Yes I've got those Bonus Blues,
Most all the time Bluest blues I've ever had
And they're all mine
When I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord to keep that pay
comin' on its way to me
(Oh! won't you kindly hear my plea)
When I start to sing or hum
Those blues get me
Better days are sure to come,
That's plain to see
Uncle Sam will surely send it
And I know just how I will spend it,
That will cure those Bonus Blues.
