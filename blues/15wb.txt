Wish I could lose these WEARY BLUES.
My tired heart can't love no more,
Can't love the way it did before.
My love was big - your love was small -
And now I've got no love at all.
Wish I could lose these WEARY BLUES.

Wantcha in the mornin' and I wantcha in the evenin'
yes I wantcha but it don't do no good.
Miss ya when it's rainin'
And I miss ya when its shinin'
And I wish that I could kiss ya and I would if I could.

But my heart can't forget
the run around it used to get!
Oh can't you see I'm tired of
this old unfair one sided love
Come back to me.
Please don't refuse.
And help me lose these WEARY BLUES.
