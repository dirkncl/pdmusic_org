1. 
Oh! the blues aint nothing,
Oh! the blues aint nothing,
But a good man feeling bad,
Oh! the blues aint nothing
But a good man feeling bad,
Oh! that’s a feeling
That I’ve often had.
You can call the blues,
You can call the blues,
Any old thing you please,
You can call the blues
Any old thing you please,
But the blues aint nothing
But the dog gone heart desease.
When a man gets blue,
When a man gets blue,
He takes a train and rides,
When a man gets blue,
He takes a train and rides,
When a woman gets blue,
She hangs her little head and cries.

2.
Oh! yonder comes,
Oh! yonder comes,
The train coming down the track,
Oh! yonder comes
The train comin’ down the track,
To take me away,
But it aint going to bring me back.
Oh! when I die,
Oh! when I die,
Honey, Honey, don’t you wear no black,
Oh! when I die,
Oh! when I die,
Honey, don’t you wear no black,
’Cause if you do,
My ghost will come sneaking back.
I’m goin’ to lay my head,
I’m goin’ to lay my head
Down on some railroad line,
I’m goin’ to lay my head
Down on some railroad line,
Let the Santa Fe
Try to pacify my mind.
