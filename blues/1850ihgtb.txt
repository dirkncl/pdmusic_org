1.
This world appear'd last night to me,
A very pleasant world to be.
Life was a rosy dream I vow.
It seems a horrid nightmare now!
Then I was gayest of the gay,
But I have got the blues to day;
  Then I was gayest of the gay,
  But I have got the blues to day.

2.
Last night to Fannie, lovely maid!
I gave a charming serenade;
And ev'ry minute wished an hour,
That I might linger near her bow'r;
But little Fan has gone away,
And I have got the blues to day;
  But little Fan has gone away,
  And I have got the blues to day;

3.
Last ev'ning seem'd a joyous time,
With Fannie, music friends and wine;
I and my gay companions laugh'd,
And sung, and flowing howls we quaff'd;
I should not wonder much if they,
Had got, like me the _blues_ to day;
  I should not wonder much if they,
  Had got, like me the _blues_ to day!

4.
I wish that I had never been,
Of what has past, a fancy scene,
But more, oh! more than all I sigh,
That Fannie ever pleased mine eye;
Of that the charmer went away,
To leave me in the blues to day;
  Of that the charmer went away,
  To leave me in the blues to day!
