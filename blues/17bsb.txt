I've seen the lights of gay Broadway,
Old Market Street down by the Frisco Bay,
I've strolled the Prado, I've gambled on the Bourse
The seven wonders of the world I've seen
And many are the places I have been.
Take my advice folks and see Beale Street first.

You'll see pretty Browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor mades and hand me downs
You'll meet honest men and pick-pockets skilled
You'll find that bus'ness never closes till somebody gets killed.

You'll see Hog-Nose rest'rants and Chitlin' Cafes
You'll see Jugs that tell of bygone days
And places, once just a sham,
You'll see Golden Balls enough to pave the New Jerusalem.

If Beale Street could talk
If Beale Streak could talk,
Married men would have to take their beds and walk
Except one or two, who never drink booze
And the blind man on the corner who sings the Beale Street Blues.

[Beal Street Blues]
I'd rather be here, than any place I know.
I'd rather be here than any place I know.
It's goin' to take Sergant
For to make me go,
Goin' to the river, maybe, bye and bye.
Goin' to the river, and there's a reason why
Because the river's wet
And Beale Street doggone dry.
