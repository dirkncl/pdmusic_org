1.
Oh there's no use talking folks I'm feeling blue,
Oh there's no use talking folks I'm feeling blue
All alone in New York town and loaded down
with the mean old blues
Those Broadway blues.
Got to go and get myself some gin right now
Got to go and get myself some gin right now
It's an awful thing when gloom keep hanging 'round
With the Broadway blues, those Broadway Blues.

CHORUS
Oh the blues, oh the blues,
did you ever have the Broadway blues,
They're the meanest old Blues,
those nasty Broadway Blues.

2.
Oh there's no use talking folks the panic's on,
Oh there's no use talking folks the panic's on,
'Cause my gal's done left me and my sugar's gone
and I've got the blues
Those Broadway blues.
Oh you baby "Babe" Yo' sure did treat me mean
Oh you baby "Babe" Yo' sure did treat me mean
If you don't come back,
I'm goin' to take morphine
To kill the blues, those Broadway Blues.

CHORUS
Oh the blues, oh the blues,
did you ever have the Broadway blues,
They're the meanest old Blues,
those nasty Broadway Blues.
Those mean old Blues,
Those Broadway Blues.
