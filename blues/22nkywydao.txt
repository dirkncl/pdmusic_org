"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" (1922)
Words and Music by Jimmy Cox

1.
Once I lived the life of a millionaire.
Spent all my money; I just did not care.
Took all my friends out for a good time;
bought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine.

2.
Then I began to fall so low.
Lost all my good friends;
I did not have nowhere to go.
I get my hands on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins, yeah.

3.
No, nobody knows you
when you're down and out.
In you pocket, not one penny.
And as for friends, you don't have any.

4.
When you fin'lly get back up on your feet again,
ev'rybody wants to be your long lost friend.
Said, it's mighty strange, 'out a doubt.
Nobody knows you,
nobody knows,
nobody knows you
when you're down and out.
