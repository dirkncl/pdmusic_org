"Tishomingo Blues" (1917)
by Spencer Williams

1.
Oh Mississippi,
Oh Mississippi,
My heart cries our for you in sadness,
I want to be where, the wintry winds don't blow,
Down where the southern swings low,
That's where I want to go.

CHORUS 2 times
I'm goin' to Tishomingo, because I'm sad today,
I wish to linger, way down old Dixie way.
Oh my weary heart cries out in pain,
Oh how I wish that I was back again,
With a race, in a place,
Where they make you welcome all the time,
Way down in Mississippi,
Among the cypress trees,
They get you dippy, with their strange melodies,
To resist temptation, I just can't refuse,
In Tishomingo I wish to linger,
Where they play the weary blues.


2.
Tonight I'm prayin',
Tonight I'm sayin',
Oh Lord please bless the train that takes me,
To Tishomingo, way down old Dixie way,
Where southern folks are always gay,
That's why you hear me say.

(CHORUS 2 times)
