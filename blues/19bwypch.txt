"Baby, Won't You Please Come Home" (1919)
Words by Charles Warfield
Music by Clarence Williams, 1898-1965

VERSE
I've got the blues, I feel so lonely,
I'd give the world id I could only,
make you understand.
It sure would be grand.
I'm goin' telegraph you baby,
Ask you won't you please come home
'Cause when you're gone I'm all forlorn,
I worry all day long:

CHORUS A
Baby, won't you please come home,
'Cause your mamma's all alone.
I have tried in vain,
never no more to call, you name.
When you left you broke me heart
Because I thought we'd never part.
Ev'ry hour of the day, you will hear me say,
Baby won't you please come home.

CHORUS B
Baby, won't you please come home,
'Cause your mamma's all alone.
I have tried in vain,
never no more to call, you name.
When you left you broke me heart
Because I thought we'd never part.
Ev'ry hour of the day, you will hear me say,
Baby won't you please come home
Daddy needs mama.
Baby won't you please come home.
