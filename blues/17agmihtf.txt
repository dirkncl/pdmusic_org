"A Good Man Is Hard to Find" (1917)
Words and Music by Eddie Green

VERSE
My heart's sad and I'm all forlorn,
my man's treating me mean.
I regret the day that I was born
and that man of mine I've ever seen.
My happiness, it never lasts a day;
my heart is almost breaking while I say:

CHORUS 2 times
A good man is hard to find;
you always get the other kind.
Just when you think that he is your pal,
you look for him and find him folling 'round some other gal.
Then you rave; you even crave,
to see him laying in his grave.
So, if your man is nice, take my advice,
and hug him in the morning, kiss him ev'ry night,
give him plenty of lovin', treat him right,
for a good man nowadays is hard to find.
