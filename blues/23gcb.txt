"Gulf Coast Blues" (1923)
Words and Music by Clarence Williams, 1898-1965

I've been blue all day, my man's gone away.
He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told.
I tried to treat him kind. I thought he would be mine,
That man I hate to lose, that's why mama's got the blues.
The man I love he has done left this town,
The man I love he has done left this town.
And if it keeps on snowing I will be Gulf Coast bound.
The mailman passed but he didn't leave no news.
The mailman passed but he didn't leave no news.
I'll tell the world he left me with those Gulf Coast blues.
Some of you men sure do make me tired.
Some of you men sure do make me tired.
You've got a mouth full of "gimme," a handful of "much oblige."
