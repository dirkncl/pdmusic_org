1.
I haven't got a cozy flat
Where I can hang my coat and hat.
I've been a rover the world over,
And believe me, I don't live in clover,
I seldom lay my head on a nice soft feather bed.
I've got a home that runs on wheels
Where they don't serve homemade meals.
It's train on track two,
Ding! Dong! Choo! Choo!
Let me tell you how it feels.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
It's Louisville to Nashville,
Birnmingham to Knoxville.
All aboad. All aboard.
That's all I ever hear,
Somebody yelling in my ear--
I maybe meet a nice girl where I am
And then I get a telegram to go to Alabam.
I only see my Mother,
Daddy and my Brother
For a day
Then I'm away.
I have to wait until they
Send me the news
I met a girl in Tennessee, now just for example,
When she got thru' she didn't even leave me a sample
That's why I've got these traveling
Choo-Choo Choo-Choo Blues.

2.
I'm like a roamin' Romeo
Because I'm always on the go.
I'm like a sail or board a whaler
All my love afairs have been a failure.
I very seldom see any fave that's dear to me.
I know it really is a shame
To be in this traveling game.
It's goodbye, I'll go,
I'll try, I know
Ev'ry day is just the same.
