1.
I've been known to be a rolling stone for many years
Now alone I sit around and moan when night appears
Thoughts of my home
Fill me with regrettable tears
Ev'ry year Oh! how I long to hear a bit of news
Friends appear to offer words of cheer but I refuse
Pack up my trunk 'cause I've got those home again blues

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
I'm going Home know at the door
Home just like before
Roam never no more
No place like Home
Oh! what a song
Home where I belong
Oh! I've got those Home again blues

2.
I can't wait until I reach that gate and home I see
Sure as fate I know they're gonna wait to welcome me
I want to state
That's the end of misery
If I knew I'd ever feel so blue I'd never roam
But it's true we learn a thing or two away from home
I'm telling you I've ceased to be a rollable stone
