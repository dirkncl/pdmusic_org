1.
I feel Oh so blue,
I really don't know what to do
I got a brand new job-- a tip collector,
It's some job, a car protector,
Since I left my home and started on railroads to roam,
I get nothing but abuse,
So tell me what's the use.

CHORUS
[1.] 
It's "Pullman Porter, draft on my feet,"
It's "Pullman Porter, turn on the heat"
It's "Pullman Porter, all live long day.
"Pullman Porter bring me water" that's all they say,
It's "Pullman Porter, make up my berth"
I'ts "Pullman Porter no place on earth,"
"Oh Pullman Porter, won't you shime my shoes,"
I got the Pullman Porter Blues.
[2.]
It's "Pullman Porter, turn on the light,"
It's "Pullman Porter, get me a bite"
It's "Pullman Porter" all the whole night thru.
It seems to be I'm always wrong whatever I do
It's "Pullman Porter, what town are we at?"
It's "Pullman Porter, brush off my hat"
"Now look here Porter, some one stole my booze,"
I got the Pullman Porter Blues.

2.
Believe me when I say,
I'm on the go the live long day
I try to earn my dough in Pullman servtee,
I'm not slow, but I'm so nervous,
When night time comes around and in the car there's not a sound,
Just as I get to my bed,
Then the bell rings over my head.
