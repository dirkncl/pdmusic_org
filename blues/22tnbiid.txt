"Taint Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do" (1922)
Words and Music
by Porter Grainger and Everett Robbins

1.
There ain't nothin' I can do, nor nothin' I can say,
That folks don't criticize me;
But I'm gonna do just as I want to anyway,
And don't care if they all despise me.

REFRAIN
If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
Rather than persecute me,
I choose that you would shoot me,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
If I should get the feelin'
To dance on the ceilin',
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
If I get me best companion
Drive me right into the canyon,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.

If I dislike my lover
And leave him for another,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
If I go to church on Sunday,
Then cabaret on Monday,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
If my friend ain't got no money
And I say "take all mine, honey,"
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.
If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle,
'TAIN'T NOBODY'S BIZ-NESS IF I DO.

2.
After all, the way to do is do just as you please,
Regardless of their talkin';
Often times ones that talk will get down on their knees,
And beg your pardon for their squawkin'.
