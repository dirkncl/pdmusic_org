1.
I'm so thirsty that I'm blue,
Old friend Booze I long for you,
I never knew that I'd miss you,
The way I do Boohoo, Boohoo,
Anheuser Busch has ceased to bloom,
Now my life is filled with gloom,
My tongue's crackin' I'm so dry
Since the country's gone Prohi:

CHORUS 2 times
I've got the Prohibition Blues --
I've got the Prohibition Blues --
Now when I take a drink that sky juice at the sink,
Just makes me cry and sigh
For dear old Rock and Rye --
I've got the Prohibition Blues --
I've got the Prohibition Blues --
In memory of beer I'll shed a tear, a bitter tear,
All 'round town I toddle, I'm a molly coddle,
I've got the Prohibition Blues, for my booze.

2.
Won't believe you've gone to stay,
Old friend Booze I grieve all day,
I'm gonna hit the hay and stay,
Forever and a day, I say,
Why did you let them treat you so?
Just to please old "Moll Bevo?"
My throat's achin' I'm so dry
Since the country's goe Prohi:

(CHORUS 2 times)
