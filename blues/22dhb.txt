"Down Hearted Blues" (1922)
Words by Alberta Hunter, 1895-1984
Music by Lovie Austin

1.
Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you.
I'm so disgusted, heart-broken, too.
I've got those down hearted blues.
Once I was crazy 'bout a {man. He|gal. She} mistreated me all the time.
The next {man|gal} I get {he's|she's} got to promise me to be mine, all mine.

2.
If I could only find the {man|gal} oh how happy I would be.
To the Good Lord ev'ry night I pray.
Please send my {man|gal} back to me.
I've almost worried myself to death wondr'ing why {he|she} went away.
But just wait and see {he's|she's} gonna want me back some sweet day.

CHORUS 1
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days.
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days.
It seems that trouble's goint to follow me to my grave.

CHORUS 2
Got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand.
Got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand.
Going to hold it, baby, till you come under my command.

Additional Choruses (Ad lib.)
CHORUS 3
Say, I ain't loved but three {men|women} in my life.
No, I ain't loved but  three {men|women} in my life,
'Twas my {father, brother|mother, sister} and the {man|woman} who wrecked my life.

CHORUS 4
'Cause {he|she} mistreated me and {he|she} drove me from {his|her} door,
Yes, {he|she} mistreated me and {he|she} drove me from {his|her} door,
But the Good Book says you'll read just what you sow.

CHORUS 5
Oh, it may be a week and it may be a month or two,
Yes, it may be a week and it may be a month or two,
But the day you quit your honey, it's coming home to you.

CHORUS 6
Oh, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried,
Yes, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried,
Hand the down hearted blues and couldn't be satisfied.
