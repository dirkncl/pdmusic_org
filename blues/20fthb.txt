1.
Now my babe has left me
I don't know what I'll do
Now ev'ry day I miss her
And it makes me feel blue
I'm leavin here today
And that is why I say.

[CHORUS]
I'm leavin town to wear you off my mind
I've been mistreated
And I don't mind dyin
I'll buy me a ticket long as my right arm
I'll ride so far you think I'm dead and gone
I'm Alabama bound
I told you last spring
When the bluebirds began to sing.
I was goin' away not to wear black
And there's nothing in this world will bring me back
Now I've turned you down
Leavin this lonesome town
I'll buy a gun as long as I am tall
Shoot myself a man and catch the cannon ball
Fare thee honey I don't want that stall.

2.
Now my babe has left me
She don't want me no more
So ev'ry day I want her
And she do grieve me so
I am on my sweet way
My love has gone astray.

(CHORUS)
