Blues ain't nothin' but the easy goin' heart disease,
Brother stop your moanin'
Blues can't make you warmer if you're bound to freeze
Sister stop your groanin'
Why don't you rise and shine
Take dem blues right off your mind 'cause
the blues ain't nothin' but the easy goin' heart disease,
That's all! Lawd!

CHORUS 2 times
Ev'ry body's crazy 'bout the doggone blues,
but I'm happy, ([SPOKEN]_whew_)
Ev'ry body's crazy. but if I must choose,
no doggone blues for mine.
I gets aplenty to eat,
I never worry,
Shoes on my feat, don't have to hurry,
I'm not afraid, my rent is paid,
And I can sleep at ninetyfour in the shade.
Ev'ry body's singing lotta bad old news but I'm happy,
([SPOKEN] (_whew_)
yes, happy. ([SPOKEN) _whew_)
Life's too doggone short to weep and whine.
Dem home sickness blues,
Lawd! take 'em away.
Ev'ry body's crazy 'bout the doggone blues, but I'm happy
all the time.
[2nd time only] ([SPOKEN] _whew_)

You all know how Mister Jonah got into that whale,
Fell into the ocean
There's one man that should have sung the blues but failed,
Never had the notion
Old Jonah knew dem whales
'Stead of blues he ragged the scales,
then the whale got gay and let old Jonah right out of jail,
No lie! Lawd!

(CHORUS 2 times)
