"The Jazz-Me Blues" (1921)
Words and Music by Tom Delany

1.
Down in Louisiana in that sunny clime,
They play a class of music that is super fine,
And it makes no difference if its rain or shine,
You can hear that that jazz band music playing all the time.
It sounds so peculiar cause the music's queer.
How its sweet vibration seem to fill the air.
Then to you the whole world seems to be in rhyme.
You want nothing else but jazz-band music all the time.

Ev'ry one that's nigh
Never seems to sigh,
Hear them loudly cry:
Oh!

CHORUS A
Jazz man__
Don't stop that music it's Jazz man (Jazz-man)
You know I want to hear it both day and night,
And if you don't blow it hot then I
Don't feel right
Now if it's ragtime
please sir will you play it in
jazztime (Jazztime)
Don't want it fast
Don't want it slow
Take your time don't rush it play it
sweet and low
I've got those dog-gone real-gone
jazz-band 'jazz-me' blues. Oh!

CHORUS B
Jazz man__
Don't stop that music it's Jazz man (Jazz-man)
You know I like my dancin' both day and night,
And if I don't hear it hot note I
Don't feel right
Now if it's ragtime
please sir will you play it in
jazztime (Jazztime)
Don't want it fast
Don't want it slow
Take your time don't rush it play it
sweet and low
I've got those dog-gone old time
jazz-band 'jazz-me' blues.

2.
Ev'rybody now adays does that dance
You'd better learn to do it while you've got the chance,
Its pleasing syncopation has come to stay,
Now all you've got to do is just to swing away.
So when you hear that band a-playing at the ball,
Grab your gal and do your stuff around the hall.
With nothing on your mind but music's tuneful sound
Only waiting for the time so you can show her 'round.

Take your time and sway
Throw yourself away,
Let me hear you say:
Oh!

(CHORUS A)
(CHORUS B)
