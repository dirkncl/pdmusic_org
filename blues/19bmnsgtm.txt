"Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me" (1919)
by N. Swanstone, Chas R. McCarron and Carey Morgan

1.
What is that song about kisses,
What is that song about smiles?
If I could have my way,
I'd sing a song today,
That would beat them all by miles;
I wouldn't sing about smiling,
That's not the title I'd choose,
I would sing about what I've got,
And what I've got's the weary blues.

CHORUS
There are BLUES that you get from worry--
There are BLUES that you get from pain,
And there are BLUES when you're lonely
For your one and only,
The BLUES you can never explain;
There are BLUES that you get from longing
But the bluest BLUES that be
Are the sort of BLUES that's on my mind,
They're the very meanest kind,
The BLUES my naughty sweetie gives to me.

There are BLUES that you get when your single--
Those are BLUES that will give you pain,
And there are BLUES when you're lonely
For your one and only,
The BLUES you can never explain;
There are BLUES that you get from longing
To hold someone on your knee,
But the kind of BLUES that always stabs,
Comes from hiring taxicabs,
The BLUES my naughty sweety gives to me.

2.
No use in chasing those rainbows,
Rainbows will never help you,
They look so bright and gay,
But they will fade away,
They you'll find the sky's all BLUE;
Look at the ocean and that's BLUE,
My sweetie's eyes are BLUE too,
When she got me she BLEW away,
And natur'ly that makes me BLUE.

CHORUS
There are BLUES that you get from your sweetie
When she 'phones to another guy,
And there are BLUES when your honey
Spends all of your money,
And BLUES when she tells you a lie;
There are BLUES that you get when married
Wishing that you could be free,
But the kind of BLUES that's good and BLUE,
Comes from buying wine for two,
The kind of BLUES my sweetie gives to me.
