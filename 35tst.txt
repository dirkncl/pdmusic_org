1[a].
He leaped into the Boat,
As it lay upon the Strand;
But Oh! his heart was far away,
With friends upon the Land,
He thought of those he lov'd the best,
A Wife, an Infant dear,
And feeling fill'd the Sailor's breast,
The Sailor's eye; -- a tear.

1[b].
Upon the hill he turn'd,
To take a last fond look,
Of the valley and the village church
And the cottage by the brook,
He listen'd to the sounds so familiar to his ear,
And the Soldier leant upon his sword,
And wiped away a tear.

2[a].
They stood upon the far off Cliff,
And wav'd a kerchief wite,
And gaz'd upon his gallant Bark,
Till she was out of sight:
The Sailor cast a look behind,
No longer saw them near
Then rais'd the Canvas to his Eye
And wip'd away a Tear.

2[b].
Beside that Cottage Porch,
A girl won on her knees,
She held aloft a snowy scaft,
Which flutter'd in the breeze;
She breath'd a pray'r for him,
A pray'r he could not hear,
But he pass'd to bless her as she knelt,
And wiped away a Tear.

3[a].
Ere long o'er Ocean's blue expanse,
His sturdy Bark had sped,
The gallant Sailor from her Prow,
Descries a Sail ahead;
And then he rais'd his mighty Arm,
For Britain's Foes were near,
Ay then he raise'd his Arm, but not
To wipe away Tear.

3[b].
He turn'd and left the spot,
Oh! do not deem him weak,
For dauntless was the Soldier's heart,
Tho' tears were on his cheek;
Go watch the foremost ranks,
In dangers dark career,
Be sure the hand most daring there
Has wiped away a Tear.
