As sung by the Virginia Minstrels

1.
I come to town de udder night,
I hear de noise an saw de fight,
De watchman was a runnin roun,
crying Old Dan Tucker's come to town,

Gran' CHORUS
So get out de way!
get out de way!
get our de way!
Old Dan Tucker
your to late to
come to supper.

2.
Tucker is a nice old man,
He use to ride our darby ram;
He sent him whizzen down de hill,
If he hadn't got up he'd lay dar still.

(Gran' CHORUS)

3.
Here's my razor in good order
Magnum bonum--jis hab bought 'er;
Sheep shell oats, Tucker shell de corn,
I'll shabe you soon as de water get warm.

(Gran' CHORUS)

4.
Ole Dan Tucker an I got drunk,
He fell in de fire an kick up a chunk,
De charcoal got inside he shoe
Lor bless you honey how de ashes flew.

(Gran' CHORUS)

5.
Down de road foremost de stump,
Massa make me work de pump;
I pump so hard I broke de sucker,
Dar was work for ole Dan Tucker.

(Gran' CHORUS)

6.
I went to town to buy some goods
I lost myself in a piece of woods,
De night was dark I had to suffer,
It froze de heel of Daniel Tucker.

(Gran' CHORUS)

7.
Tucker was a hardened sinner,
He neber said his grace at dinner;
De ole sow squeel, de pigs did squall
He 'hole hog wid de tail and all.

(Gran' CHORUS)

"Minstrel Songs, Old and New" (1883)]

And now ole Dan is a gone sucker,
And neber can go home to supper;
Old Dan he has had his last ride,
And de Banjo's buried by his side.

CHORUS
So get out de way, Ole Dan Tucker,
get our de way, Old Dan Tucker,
get our de way, Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to come to supper.
