1.
Gentle waves upon the deep,
Murmur soft when thou dost sleep,
Little birds upon the tree,
Sing their sweetest songs for thee,
their sweetest songs for thee.
Cooling gales with voices low,
In the tree tops gently blow,
When thou dost in slumbers lie,
All things love thee, so do I,
When thou dost in slumbers lie,
All things love thee, so do I,
All things love thee,
All things love thee,
All things love thee, so do I.

2.
When thou wak'st the sea will pour
Threasures for thee to the shore,
And the earth, in plant and tree,
bring forth fruit and flowers for thee
Fruit and flowers for thee.
Whil'st the glorious stars above
Shine on thee like trusting love,
When thou dost in slumbers lie,
All things love thee so do I,
When thou dost in slumbers lie
All things love thee so do I,
All things love thee,
All things love thee,
All things love thee so do I.
