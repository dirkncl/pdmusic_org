1.
Oh Deart' he is a lit-tle man,
And he goes from do' to do',
He kill some soul's and he wound-ed some,
And he lef' some souls to pray.

Oh Deart' he is a lit-tle man,
And he goes from do' to do',
He kill some soul's and he wound-ed some,
And he lef' some souls to pray.

CHORUS
Oh Lord, re-mem-ber me,
Do, Lord re-mem-ber me;
Re-mem-ber me as de year roll round,

Oh Lord, re-mem-ber me,
Do, Lord re-mem-ber me;
Re-mem-ber me as de year roll round,
Lord, re-mem-ber me.

I want to die like-a Je-sus die,
And he die wid_a free good will,

Do, Lord, re-mem-ber me.

I want to die like-a Je-sus die,
And he die wid_a free good will,
I lay out in de grave and_I stretch_es our_e arms,
Do, Lord, re-mem-ber me.
