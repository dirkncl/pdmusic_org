"Steal Away to Jesus"
Traditional Negro Spiritual

CHORUS
Steal away, steal away,
steal away to Jesus!
Steal away, steal away home,
I ain't got long to stay here!

1.
My Lord calls me,
He calls me by the thunder;
The trumpet sounds with in-a my soul,
I ain't got long to stay here.

(CHORUS)

2.
Green trees are bending,
Poor sinner stands atrembling;
The trumpet sounds with in-a my soul,
I ain't got long to stay here.

(CHORUS)

3.
Tome stones are bursting,
Poor sinner stands atrembling,
The trumpet sounds with in-a my soul,
I ain't got long to stay here.

(CHORUS)

4.
My Lord calls me,
He calls me by the lightning,
The trumpet sounds with in-a my soul,
I ain't got long to stay here.

(CHORUS)
