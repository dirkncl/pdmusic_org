"Great Day"
Traditional American Negro Spiritual

CHORUS
Great day!
Great day, the righteous marching.
Great day.
  God's going to build up Zion's walls,
Great day!
Great day, the righteous marching.
Great day.
  God's going to build up Zion's walls.

1.
Chariot rode on the mountain top
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!
My God spoke and the chariot did stop,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!

(CHORUS)

2.
This is the day of jubilee,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!
The Lord has set His people free,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!

(CHORUS)

3.
We want no coward in our band,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!
We call for valiant hearted men,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!

(CHORUS)

4.
Going to take my brestplate, sword and shield,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!
And march out boldly in the field,
  God's going to build up Zion's walls!

(CHORUS)
