"Swing Low"
Traditional Spiritual

CHORUS [sung before each VERSE; and after the last]
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

1. I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,
Coming for to carry me home?
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

2. If you get there before I do,
Coming for to carry me home?
Tell all my friends I'm coming too,
Coming for to carry me home.

3. I'm sometimes up, I'm sometimes down,
Coming for to carry me home?
But still my soul feels heavenly bound,
Coming for to carry me home.
