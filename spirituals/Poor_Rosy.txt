1.
Poor Rosy, poor gal;
Poor Rosy, poor gal;
Rosy break my poor heart,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home;
I cannot stay in hell one day,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home;
I'll sing and pray my soul a-way,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.

2.
Got hard trial in my way;
Got hard trial in my way,
Got hard trial in my way,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.
O when I talk, I talk wid God,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home,
O when I talk I talk wid God,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.

3.
I dunno what de people want of me;
I dunno what de people want of me,
I dunno what de people want of me,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.
I dunno what de people want of me,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.
I dunno what de people want of me,
  Heav'n shall-a be my home.
