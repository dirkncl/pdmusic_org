"Go Down Moses"
Traditional Spiritual
Arranged by J. Rosamond Johnson, 1873-1954 (1925)

[CHORUS 2x]
Go down, Moses
'Way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharaoh,
To let my people go.

1.
When Israel was in Egypts land:
Let my people go,
Oppressed so hard they could not stand,
Let my people go.

2.
"Thus spoke the Lord," bold Moses said;
Let my people go,
If not I'll smite your first born dead,
Let my people go.

[CHORUS]
Go down, Moses,
'Way down in Egypt land,
Tell ole Pharaoh,
To let my people go.
O let my people go.
