[CHORUS sung before each verse]
Don't be weary, traveller,
  Come along home to Jesus;
Don't be weary, traveller,
  Come along home to Jesus.

1.
My head got wet with the midnight dew,
  Come along home to Jesus;
Angels bear witness too,
  Come along home to Jesus.

2.
Where to go I did not know
  Come along home to Jesus;
Ever since he freed my soul,
  Come along home to Jesus;

3.
I look at de worl' and de worl' look new,
  Come along home to Jesus;
I look at de worl' and de worl' look new,
  Come along home to Jesus.
