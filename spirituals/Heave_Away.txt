"Heave Away" (1867)
Words and Music anonymous; traditional spiritual
[This is one of the Savannah firemen's songs of which Mr. Kane
O'Donnel gave a graphic account in a letter to the Philadelphia
_Press_ "Each company," he says, "has its own set of tunes, its
own leader, and doubtless in the growth of time, necessity and
invention, its own composer."]

[Source: p. 61. No. 82., from "Slave Songs of the United States" (1867)]

Heave away, heave away!
I'd rather court a yellow gal than work for Henry Clay.
Heave away, heave away!
Yellow gal, I want to go,
I'd rather court a yellow gal than work for Henry Clay.

[CHORUS]
Heave away! Yellow gal, I want to go!
