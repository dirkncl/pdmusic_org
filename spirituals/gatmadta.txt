CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
[For] God’s agwine ter move all de troubles away, 
God’s agwine ter move all de troubles away, 
For God’s agwine ter move all de troubles away, 
See ’m no more till de comin’ day.

Genesis you understan’, 
Methusaleh was de oldes’ man; 
His age was nine hundred an’ sixty nine, 
He died an went to Heav’n in due time. 

2.
Dare was a man of de Pharisee, 
His name was Nicodemus an’ he wouldn’t believe; 
De same he came to Christ by night, 
wanta be taught out o’ human sight. 
Nicodemus was a man who wanted to know, 
Can a man be born a whena he is ol’?
Christ tol’ Nicodemus as a frien’,
a-Man, you must be born again.”

Aread about Samson from his birth, 
De stronges’ man ever walked on earth; 
a-Read way back in de ancient times, 
He slew ten thousan’ Philistines. 
A-Samson he went a-walkin’ about, 
a-Samson’s strengtha  was never found out 
Twell his wife set down upon his knee an’
a “Tell me whar yo’ strengthalies, ef you please.” 
ASamson’s wife she done talk so fair,
a-Samson tol’ her, “Cut offa ma hair, 
Ef you shave my head jes’ es clean as yo’ han’, 
Ma strengtha will becomea like a natcherl man.”
