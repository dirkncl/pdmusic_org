"The Prodigal Son" (1844)
("Many are the afflictions of the righteous:
but the Lord delivereth him out of them all."
-- Psalms 34:19.)
Words and Music by John Newton, 1779.
Arranged by E. J. King, 1844.

1.
Afflictions, tho' they seem severe,
Are oft in mercy sent:
They stopped the prodigal's career,
And caused him to repent.

CHORUS 2 times
Oh, I die with hunger, here he cries,
Oh, I die with hunger, here he cries,
And starve in a foreign land,
My Father's house hath large supplies,
And bounteous are his hands.

2.
Although he no relenting felt
Till he had spent his store,
His stubborn heart began to melt
When famine pinched him sore.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
What have I gained by sin, he said,
But hunger, shame and fear?
My Father's house abounds with bread
Whilst I am starving here.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
I'll go and tell him what I've done,
Fall down before his face;
Not worthy to be called his son,
I'll ask a servant's place.

(CHORUS 2 times)

5.
He saw his son returning back,
He looked, he ran, he smiled,
And threw his arms around the neck
Of his rebell'ous child.

(CHORUS 2 times)
