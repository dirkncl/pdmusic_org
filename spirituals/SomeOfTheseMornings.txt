1.
Going to see my mother some of these mornings,
see my mother some of these mornings,
See my mother some of these mornings.

Oh, sitting in the kingdom, some of these mornings,
sitting in the kingdom some of these mornings,
Sitting in the kingdom some of these mornings.

CHORUS [sung after each verse, with much overlapping]
Look away in the heaven, Lord,
Hope I'll join the band.

2.
Going to see my brother some of these mornings, &c.
Oh, shouting in the heavens, some of these mornings, &c.

3.
Going to walk about in Zion some of these mornings, &c.
Going to chatter with the angels some of these mornings, &c.

4.
Going to talk the troubles over some of these mornings, &c.
Going to see my Jesus some of these mornings, &c.
