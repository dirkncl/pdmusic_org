1.
I see de black smoke rollin' high
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
Dat heat am comin' by and by
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
I hear dem engines belchin steam,
She's comin' whoopin' up de stream
She's gettin' warm when de whistles scream
  Way down yonder in de cornfield

FULL CHORUS
Den Hanna wake me airly in de morn
I'm a gwine down yonder to de shuckin' ob de corn
I'll nebber come home til I hear de dinner horn
From way down yonder in de cornfield.

2.
I hoe de corn to de end of the row
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
Whe you get to the fence den lay down your hoe
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
Get on de fence an' you'll see her come,
Dem big wheels fillin de ribber wid foam
It's de Baton Rouge an' she's gwine home
  Way down yonder in de cornfield

(CHORUS)

3.
Dem Anchor Line boats am fast an' fine
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
But Bixby's boat am de boss ob de line
  Way down yonder in de cornfield
Look at de smoke an' de steam she make
Catch all de fast boats gib 'em de shake
No use talkin' for she calls for de cake
  Way down yonder in de cornfield

(CHORUS)
