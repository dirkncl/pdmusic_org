1.
The night dews are falling on flower and blossom,
The nighingale sings to its mate in the nest,
While I stray away through the clover-topped meadow,
To meet with my Barney, who's loving me best.
I don't mind the stars, tho' they're watching me closely,
I know that they never can tell what they see,
And faith, they've no ears that they'll hear what I'm saying
To-night, at the gate, to young Barney Machree.

CHORUS
O! Barney Machree, are you coming to me,
For love, don't you see,
that I'm here all alone by the buttonwood tree,
Where you promised to meet me, dear Barney Machree.

2.
I stand by the stream, and I list to its music,
And count the dull moments now passing me be,
And wonder what keeps him so late, while I'm waiting
For love's happy moments to take wings and fly.
I look at the moon, and the little stars laughing,
I watch down the lane but no one can I see,
I list for the night breeze to echo the footstep,
And sigh for the sight of young Barney Machree.

(CHORUS)

3.
Now beauty seems vailing the face of sweet nature,
As lonely I stand keeping watch at the gate;
But I must go back with a heart that is pining
Like that of a bird that would mourn for its mate.
Good night to the woods and the fields and the flowers,
Fond love, fold your wings and come nestle with me,
For faith, he's forgotten the promise he gave me,
But I have kept mine with dear Barney Machree.

(CHORUS)
