1.
I hear the sweet birds singing,
In the twilight in the grove,
And the clover blossoms tremble,
'Neath the dewdrops from above;
I can hear the water rippling,
Down the valley to the mill,
As I walk and watch my shadow,
Down the old road 'round the hill.

Refrain.
My old home in the cabin,
Is dear to mem'ry still,
I will love it till I'm burried,
Near the old road 'round the hill.

CHORUS 2 times
I hear the sweet birds singing,
In the twilight, in the grove,
And the clover blossoms tremble,
'Neath the dewdrops from above.


2.
The cabin is a log one,
And the chimney's built of clay,
It is shelter'd in the shadows,
Of the pine trees night and day;
No gilded hall or palace,
In my heart its place can fill,
And I'm happy when I'm walking,
Down the old road 'round the hill.

(Refrain.)
(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
I have gone that road in childhood,
To the school with book and slate,
And in coming home at evening,
Drove the cows up to the gate;
Where I found my mother waiting,
As I whistled tunes so shrill,
When she'd milk them, then I'd turn them,
Down the old road 'round the hill.

(Refrain.)
(CHORUS 2 times)
