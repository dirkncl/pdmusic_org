"Mollie Darling" (1872)
A Companion to "Mollie Brawn"
Song and Chorus
Written and composed
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1. Won't you tell me Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me?
For I love you Mollie darling,
You are all the world to me.
O! tell me, darling, that you love me,
Put you little hand in mine,
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling,
Say that you will give me thine.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest,
Look up, darling, tell me this;
Do you love me, Mollie darling?
Let your answer be a kiss.

2. Stars are smiling, Mollie darling,
Thro' the mystic vail of night;
They seem laughing, Mollie darling,
While fair Luna hides her light;
O! no one listens but the flowers,
While they hang their heads in shame.
They are modest, Mollie darling,
When they hear me call your name.

3. I must leave you, Mollie darling,
Tho' the parting gives me pain;
When the stars shine, Mollie darling,
I will meet you here again.
O! goodnight, Mollie, goodbye, loved one,
Happy may you ever be,
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling,
Don't forget to dream of me.
