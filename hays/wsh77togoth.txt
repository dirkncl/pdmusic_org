1.
I love to think of childhood, Jim,
Where'er in life I roam;
The little old brown cottage,
That was my boyhood's home;
The fondest recollections
Cling to my mem'ry still,
And dearly I remember, Jim,
The old gate on the hill.

CHORUS
Oh! I never can forget it, Jim,
I dearly love it still,
And wish that I could see again,
The old gate on the hill.

2.
How well do I remember, Jim,
The news at eve would wait,
When they came home at milking time,
And gather 'round the gate;
I used to lift the wooden latch
When I went down to mill,
And they'd go in, as I went out
The old gate in the hill.

(CHORUS)

3.
'Tis many years ago, dear Jim,
Since I went down the lane,
And closed the gate behind me, Jim,
And ne'er went back again;
I long to go back home once more,
And see the dear old mill,
But most of all, I'd love to see
The old gate on the hill.

(CHORUS)
