1.
Dear mamma I've put all my playthings away,
I've been such a good little darling today;
I know you love me, for often you've said
That I was your angel, now put me to bed.
The stars have come out, and Mamma, you told me
They were windows through which all the angels could see;
And now while they're smiling on us with delight,
O! kiss me, dear Mamma, come kiss me good night.

CHORUS
Angels watch over me, thy vigils keep,
Guard and protect me, while I am asleep,
O! bring me a message in dreams from Papa,
Waiting in Heaven for me and Mamma.

2.
Dear mamma, you kissed me, and told me today
That if I'd kneel down you would teach me to pray,
I heard you last night, won't you teach me the same?
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
I'll kneel when you kneel, and I'll look as you look,
So that God can write down both our pray'rs in our book,
And Papa can read them while God holds the light,
O! kiss me, dear Mamma, come kiss me good night.

(CHORUS)

3.
Dear mamma, look up, O! don't look so sad,
To know he's in Heaven should make your heart glad;
O! kiss me but once, and then smooth down my hair,
And tell me, that some day we'll meet Papa there.
You know that he's waiting, and happy he'll be
When he comes with the angels to meet you and me,
Ah! then we'll be happy in God'd pleasing sight,
O! kiss me, dear Mamma, come kiss me good night.

(CHORUS)
