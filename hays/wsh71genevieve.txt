1. Thy blue eyes are ever smiling, Genevieve,
And thy smiles are so beguiling, Genevieve;
O, I know ’tis hard to part
With the idol of my heart!
Kiss me, darling, ere I start, Genevieve,
Kiss me, darling, Genevieve, darling Genevieve.

2. Oft of thee will I be dreaming, Genevieve,
When the silver moon in beaming, Genevieve;
When I’m far away from time,
Thou’lt be thinking, love, of me;
O, how happy I will be, Genevieve!
Kiss me, darling Genevieve, darling Genevieve.

3. I will ne’er forget thee, never! Genevieve;
I’ll be true to thee forever. Genevieve;
Lay thy head upon my breast,
Like a bird that seeks its nest,
For I’ll love thee, dearest, best, Genevieve!
Kiss me, darling Genevieve, darling Genevieve.
