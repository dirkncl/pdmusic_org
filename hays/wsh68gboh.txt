"Good Bye, Old Home" (1868)
Song & Chorus
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Good bye, old home; Sad is my heart,
To think forever, tonight we must part,
Weeping I leave thee, my heart is in pain,
I feel that I never shall see thee again.
Scenes of my boyhood for ever adieu,
Oft will my memory wander to you ...
And to the loved ones where-ever I roam,
But O! I must leave thee, Good bye! Old Home.

CHORUS
Home of my heart, home, sweet home,
O! how I love thee where-ever I roam,
But we must part for the hour is nigh,
When weeping I'll murmur Old Home, Good-bye.

2.
Good bye, old home; Out on life's sea,
Mine eyes will grow dim with tears shed for thee,
think of the joys of childhood now o'er,
And weep when I think they will come never more.
I'll miss the sweet sound of the murmuring breeze
As it plays with the leaf of the towering trees ...
For I will be wandering over life's foam,
Far, from the scenes of my once happy home.

3.
Good bye, old home; Tears fill mine eyes,
Soon will be severed affectionate ties,
Bound by the love of the friends I loved true,
Who sleep in their graves, who in childhood I knew,
I've no one to love me, I've no one to cheer,
For all that I love in this world I leave here ...
Hoping whenever life's journey is o'er
I'll find me a home on the echoless shore.
