1.
In a little red brick cottage,
Standing down in yonder lane,
And an elm tree protects it
From the sunshine and the rain,--
Is a little brown-eyed lassie
In her beauty living there,
And the neighbors love to call her
Pretty Evaline Adair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! there's not a lassie living
With her beauty can compare,
She is loved by all who know her,
Pretty Evaline Adair.

2.
When the twilight shadows gather,
And the toils of day are o'er,
You can see her with her mother,
Sitting somewhere near the door;
But you'll see a chair that's empty,
And a loved one should be there,
But he died, and left his blessings
On his Evaline Adair.

3.
When the stars peep from the heavens,
And the moon is shining bright,
And the sweetest of the flowers
Taste the dew-drops of the night,
Then the angels watch the widow
And her darling kneel in prayer,
While they answer back from heaven,
"Come with Evaline Adair."
