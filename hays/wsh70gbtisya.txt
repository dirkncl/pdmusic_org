1.
Come give me your hand for tonight we must part,
And don't dim you eye with a tear,
But believe when I say--"you've a home in my heart,
And a place in my memory dear."
I am going away to a far distant land,
I don't know how long I'll remain,
But I'll always be true, come, give me your hand,
Good bye till I see you again.

CHORUS
O give me one kiss, and a smile from you eye,
And don't let your heart feel a pain,
For I'll come back to you, let me kiss you "good bye,"
Good bye till I see you again.

2.
O, let me but look on your beautiful face
And wipe the sad tear from your eyes,
And fold you on tenderly in my embrace
While I wait for the sad words "Good Bye."
O tell me, my loved one, that you will be true.
And all other loves I'll disdain.
I'll know but the one love, and that is for you,
Good bye till I see you again.

(CHORUS)

3.
When I'm lonely and sad, what a pleasure 'twill be,
To let my fond memory rove,
To a beautiful girl that is thinking of me,
And the only true heart that I love,
Come, give me your hand, and remember you, this,
That my heart and its love shall remain,
So take it and keep it, now give me a kiss,
Good bye till I see you again.

(CHORUS)
