1.
The pale moon is shedding its beautiful light;
Stars shed their beams thro' the cutains of night;
Calm is the breeze as it floats o'er the deep,
Soft as the breath of a child in its sleep.
Nature on land and at sea is at rest,
Proudly our ship glides along on its breast,
Going back home from the land of the free;
Thinking of you, darling, out on the sea!
  Thinking of you, darling, out on the sea!

CHORUS
Out on the sea,
Out on the sea,
God bless my darling,
Out on the sea,
God bless my darling,
Out on the sea!

2.
The voyage is safe and the weather is fair,
The seabird is gliding aloft through the air;
Storms do not threaten us, causing alarm,
God will protect us from death and from harm!
Happy I'll be when I see you once more,
When I get back to my own native shore;---
Until then, darling, let your prayer be,
"God bless your loved one, out on the sea!
  God bless your loved one, out on the sea!"

(CHORUS)

3.
The joy that is filling my bosom tonight,
Smiles in thro' the doors of my heart with delight;
Feeling and knowing you want me to come,
Waiting to welcome a wanderer home.
God bless the ship that is bearing me o'er,
Back to my home on myu own beloved shore---
Back to the one who is praying for me;
God bless your loved one, out on the sea!
  God bless your loved one, out on the sea!

(CHORUS)
