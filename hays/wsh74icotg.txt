1.
When the band begins to play,
We march along Broadway;
The ladies promenade,
When we're on dress parade,
I merely wave my hand,
And give the bold command
To me who understand;
Front face! Left foot!
Forward march!

CHORUS
The Captain of the guards,
I'm Captain of the guards,
The pet of all the pretty girls,
I'm Captain of the guards,
I'm Captain of the guards,
I'm Captain of the guards,
The pet of all the pretty girls,
I'm Captain of the guards.


2.
As through the streets we go,
The ladies want to know
What handsome man is that
With feather in his hat?
But soon they find me out,
They know without a doubt,
For then I stop and shout!
Eyes right! Heads up!
Forward march!

(CHORUS)

3.
Dear ladies, I invite
You to the ball tonight,
We give at Central Park,
Commencing after dark.
The fun will just begin
A little after ten,
For I'll disband the men;
Ground arms! Single file!
Double quick!

(CHORUS)
