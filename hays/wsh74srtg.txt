1.
Though far from home I wander,
Across the deep blue sea,
I wonder if the loved ones
Are thinking oft of me?
O! when I think of parting
With dear ones at the gate,
Then mem'ry paints the picture
At home around the grate.

CHORUS
The cheerful fi[-]re burning,
The old clock striking eight;
I sigh to be at home with those
Who sit around the grate.

2.
I see my gray-haired mother,
Reclining in her chair,
Beside my a-ged father
And little sisters there.
I fancy mother saying:
"The mail today is late,
We'll hear from him tomorrow,"
All sitting 'round the grate.

(CHORUS)

3.
They read the family Bible,
Then have the evening prayer,
While all kneel down together,---
I wish that I were there.
The old clock on the mantel,
Now warns them it is late;
O! would I had been present,
With loved ones 'round the grate.


(CHORUS)
