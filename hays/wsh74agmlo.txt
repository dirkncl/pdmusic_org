1.
Come, my little darling, come,
Listen what I have to say,
Kneel beside your little bed,
I will teach you how to pray.
Clasp your tiny hands like mine,
Lift your eyes as I have done,
For tonight my prayer shall be:
Angels guard my little one!

CHORUS
Angels guard my little one,
From the cradle to the grave,
Place it in your tender care,
For it has a soul to save.

2.
Come, my dearest, dearling, come!
Close your loving eyes in sleep,
For I would not for the world,
Let you see your mother weep;
Weep for him I've loved and lost,
He, whose race of life is run,
God look down in love on me!
Angels guard my little one!

(CHORUS)

3.
Sleep, my little angel, sleep,
On your pillow soft and white,
Ere I close my weary eyes,
Let me kiss you "sweet, good night."
Now I kneel and pray to God;
Ere my humble prayer is done,
He will hear my heart's appeal---
Angels guard my little one!

(CHORUS)
