1.
Oh! Thou Omnipotent most High!
Still to Thy cross I cling;
Look down with pitying eye on me,
My soul to Thee I bring.
With troubled heart and tearful eyes,
I ask, on bended knee,
When Thou dost welcome strangers home,
Save one bright crown for me.

CHORUS
The angels round the throne of grace,
When I come home to Thee,
In pity hear, Oh! hear my prayer,
Oh! save a crown for me (crown for me).

2.
The windows of my sinful soul
Are open to Thy love;
Oh! let the light of Faith and Hope
Shine on them from above.
I feel that I am drifting now
Across life's stormy sea,
And when I've reached the golden shore,
Oh! save a crown for me.

(CHORUS)

3.
Most gracious and forgiving Lord!
Oh! wash my soul of sin;
When angels meet me at Thy gates,
Tell them to let me in.
My sinful life will then be o'er,
I'll be at home with Thee,
Where there is peace forevermore,
A crown of love for me.

(CHORUS)
