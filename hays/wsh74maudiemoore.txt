1.
There's a little vineclad cottage
At the foot of yonder hill;
There's a fairy form that wanders
Down towards her father's mill;
Back again through beds of flowers,
Moves this beauty I adore,
And I see her at the window,
Modest maiden, Maudie Moore.

CHORUS
Meet me, Maudie, I am waiting
Where we've met so oft before,
Let me tell you how I love you,
Little sweetheart, Maudie Moore.

2.
Summer roses love to gather
All about the garden wall;
None are sweeter or so lovely,
She's the fairest of them all;
When I see her form so perfect,
Standing in the cottage door,
Then I think her home is Heaven,
And its angel: Maudie Moore.

(CHORUS)

3.
Eyes as bright as stars of evening,
Brow as fair as fair can be,
Cheeks like roses, lips like cherries,---
She is all the world to me.
When my heart with friendship's beating,
Love comes knocking at the door,
Friendship jumps out the window,
Love leads in my Maudie Moore.

(CHORUS)
