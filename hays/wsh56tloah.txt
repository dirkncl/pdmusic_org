1.
Tho’ far away from home I’ve wander’d,
O’er life’s dark and stormy sea,
Many happy days I’ve squander’d
When my heart was light and free,
I left my own my native place,
Where oft in childhood I did roam,
But now I run life’s narrow race
I miss those lovely little ones at home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then what are all life’s joys to me,
Since I have cross’d the ocean’s foam.
Oh would that I once more could see
Those merry lovely little ones at home.

2.
My Mother wept when I departed,
Kiss’d my brow and spoke farewell,
Father almost broken hearted
His tears it seem’d a tale to tell;
I cast my eye towards my Brother,
My Sister too who sat alone,
Ever I’ll remember Moth-er,
And the lovely little ones at home.
