1.
Lonely I sit me and weep,
Weep as I have not for years;
Why do mine eyes fail to keep
Back these affectionate tears?
I think of dear ones o'er the sea,
Who love me where ever I roam;
Oh! go to them, tell them for me,
To write me a letter from home.

CHORUS
Have they forgotten me now,
Or do they expect me to come?
No, no; Go and tell them for me,
To write me a letter from home.

2.
I think of the old fashioned cot,
I've left it for many a year;
The last words, God bless you; I've got
From mother and father so dear,
They hope that my voyage would be
A pleasant one over the foam;
Oh! some one go and tell them for me,
To write me a letter from home.

(CHORUS)
