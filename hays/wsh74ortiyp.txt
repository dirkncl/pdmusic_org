1.
When the curtains of night are pinn'd back by the stars,
And the beautiful moon leaps the skies,
And the dewdrops of heaven are kissing the rose,
It is then that sweet memory flies,
As if on the wings of some beautiful dove,
In haste with the message it bears;
'Tis hope for the erring wherever they are,
Oh, remember them all in your pray'rs.

CHORUS
Stray where they will---on land or at sea,
Oh, lighten the burden each bears.
And at night, when you kneel by your bedside and pray,
Oh, remember them all in your prayers.

2.
We have lov'd some too fondly to ever forget,
Whatever the depths they may see,
And the kiss of affection still warm on your lips,
Long shall linger with you and with me!
We'll strive to reclaim them to manhood again
We'll lure them from pitfalls and snares;
Oh, show that we love them wherever they roam,
And remember them all in your pray'rs.

(CHORUS)
