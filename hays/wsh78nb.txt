1. In a little lowroofed cottage,
Down beside the summer son,
Dwells a little fairhaired lassie,
Who is all the world to me.
I have often, often met her,
When the evening sun went down,
And the birds would sing their sweetest,
For my pretty Nellie Brown.

CHORUS 1-3.
O! she is the fairest lassie, 
that ever I have found,
She’s a perfect little beauty,
My pretty Nellie Brown.

2. O! her cheeks are red as roses,
And her brow is white as snow,
There is music in her footsteps,
And her voice is sweet and low,
When she moves among the roses,
They hung their faces down,
And blush befpre the beauty,
Of my pretty Nellie Brown.

3. When the stars of evening glisten,
Through the curtains of the night,
I will wander off to meet her,
When the moon is not in sight.
I will tell the same old story,
As she looks upon the ground,
And blushes at the kisses,
On the lips of Nellie Brown.
