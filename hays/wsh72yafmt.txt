1. We two have been good friends, John,
For many, many years,
Your eyes have always worn their smiles,
Whule mine were dimmed with tears.
Dame Fortune shook me off, Johm,
And fixed her eye on you;
In  all the varied scenes of life,
You’ve always found me true.

CHORUS 1-3.
So let’s shake hands together, John,
No matter what we do,
I care not where you find me, John,
You’ll always find me true.

2. Your path is one of pleasure, John,
Your life is full of glee,
While mine is one of ruts and stones,
That God picked out for me.
My heart’z best wish is with you, John,
’Tis all that I can do,
To wish you well; for John, you know,
You’ve always found me true.

3. Your pilgrimage and mine, John,
Both lead us to the grave;
You’ve got a soul to answer for,
And I’ve got one to save.
So take me by the hand, John;
The best thing we can do,
Is: strive to have our Father say,
He’s always found us true.
