1. O! I mind the cottage Linnie Drown,
  Down beside the sea,
Where we met in childhood, Linnie Drown.
  Only you and me,
There we gathered shells together,
  There we told our loves so true,
Your heart was mine to keep forever,
  And I gave mine to you.

CHORUS 1-3.
O! Linnie, darling Linnie,
  I often think of you,
And wonder if you love me, Linnie Drown,
  O! is your heart still true?

2. O sad tbe hour of parting Linnie Drown,
  When we said farewell,
How I loved you dearly, Linnie Drown,
  None but you can tell,
When I saw the teardrops creeping,
  Down upon your check so fair,
Mine eyes grew weary then with weeping,
  My heart was weighed with care.

3. This life is full of changes, Linnie Drown,
  There’s no change in me,
And I love the cottage, Linnie Drown,
  Down beside the sea.
I am coming back O! greet me
  With a kiss upon the shore,
Where we parted, Linnie, meet me,
And we will part no more.
