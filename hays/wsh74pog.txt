1.
See him like a child again,
In his old armchair,
Mark the wrinkles on his face,
Time has pencilled there;
Thinking o'er the dreamy past,
Scarce a word to say,---
Ah, we never can forget
Poor old grandpa, old and gray.

CHORUS
Let us love him, one and all,
Soon he'll pass away,
Treat him kindly while you can,---
Poor old grandpa, old and gray.

2.
All that's lovely to behold
Is a blank to him,
Summer seems to charm him not,
His old eyes are dim;
Living in life's evening now,
Joys of earth decar,
We will smooth the path for you,
Poor old grandpa, old and gray.

(CHORUS)

3.
Tott'ring with his faithful staff,
Failing strength to save,
Step by step he journeys on,
Down towards the grave;
Angels, when you meet him there,
Guide him on his way,
Help unto the pearly gates
Poor old grandpa, old and gray.

(CHORUS)
