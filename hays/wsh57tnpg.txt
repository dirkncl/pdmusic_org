1. 
Oh! don’t you remember Will,
Where you and I have play’d?
The old elm tree, that grew so tall,
We’ve sat beneath its shade.
The Things that were, we lov’d so dear,
Upon us often frown’d.
Oh! Willie, happiness still reigns,
Upon the New Play Ground.

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Oh! Willie dear, come meet me soon,
And sport with me around,
’Twill glad the hearts of old play mates,
Upon the New Play Ground.

2. 
And don’t you remember Will?
The spring that flowed so free,
’Tis running still; the little birds,
Sing all their songs to me.
I’ve thought of you, and oh! how true,
I’ve heard your sweet voice sound;
O! Willie dear, I miss thee here,
Upon the New Play Ground.

3. 
Oh! but return— tomorrow Will,
And I shall meet you there;
Where we have met so oft before,
To gather flowers fair.
I’m lonely here, Oh! Willie dear,
If pleasure can be found,
’Tis when we’re sitting, side by side,
Upon the New Play Ground.
