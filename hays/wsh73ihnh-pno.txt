1. Oh! how the merciless winter winds blow,
As onward I tread through the “beautiful snow,”
Asking a penny from each one I meet,
To buy me some shoes for my little cold feet
No one takes pity, or hears my appeal,
God alone knows how I suffer and feel;
Half starved and shivering, sadly I roam,
No place to shelter me— I have no home.

CHORUS 1-3.
Angels of Heaven, look down from the skies,
Oh! go to our Father with tears in you eyes,
And tell Him to call me, I’m ready to come,
For I have no home— I have no home.

2. Father and mother now sleep in the grave;
I gave to the poor all they told me to save;
But how little I dreamed when they came to the door,
That I would be penniless, homeless, and poor
Teardrops now freeze on my colorless cheek,
I tremble with weakness whenever I speak,
No one seems caring wherever I roam,
What will become of me? I have no home.

3. Oh! where shall I go? tell me, what can I do,
Is there no one to tell me what course to pursue?
With me little dress torn, and no shoes on my feet—
Oh! I’m hungry and cold— must I die in the street?
When my journey is over, and Death calls me to go,
Let me die in the street in the “beautiful snow.”
When I wake, it will be with the angels to roam,
For I’ll then have a home— I’ll be at home.
