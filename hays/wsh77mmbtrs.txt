1.
Meet me at the river side,
Near the willow tree,
Nature must have planted there,
Just for you and me
Meet me when the little stars,
First begin to beam,
At their faces Genevieve
Dancing on the stream.

CHORUS
Yes! meet me by the riverside
When the night has come.
We'll be happy Genevieve.
Love will light me home.

2.
Meet me at the river side,
Smiles upon your face,
Come and I will welcome you,
In one sweet embrace.
Let your heart be full of joy,
Eyes in beauty shine,
Oh! give me yours, my Genevieve
And I will give you mine.

(CHORUS)

3.
Meet me at the river side,
Where we've met before,
Where we've told our sweetest loves,
A hundred times, or more,
Come, and tell it o'er again,
It is always new,
When 'tis told with kisses sweet
Genevieve by you.

(CHORUS)
