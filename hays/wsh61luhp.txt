1.
America! Beloved land!
Once beatiful and bright,
Oh! why should friendship turn to hate,
Oh why should brothers fight?
Oh! hold the mighty arm of war,
And let this hatred cease,
And let our voices shout with joy
That all we want is peace.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Let the cannon's roar be heard no more,
And let the war-cry cease!
Oh! may our country live again
In happiness and peace.

2.
Lay down your arms Oh! might hosts
'Tis for our country's cause,
"Let us be friends for ever" now,
We'll gain the world's applause.
But, if this war goes madly on,
We'll face the cannon's mouth
"Tis worse than vain for you to try
To subjugate the South."
