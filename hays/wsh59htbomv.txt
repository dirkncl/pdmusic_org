1. Oh! sweet was the vale, where we wander’d side by side,
  Where we sat ’neath the old Elm tree,
And the moon smiled on s as we watch’d the ebbing tide,
  And you gazed in thy beauty on me.
But, sweeter the smile of his sparkling black eye,
  His love will never, never fail,
For Harry will be true, to his “Bonny Eloise,”
  He’s the heau of the Mohawk Vale.

CHORUS 1-2.
But sweeter the smile of his sparkling blue eye,
  His love will, never, never fail,
For Harry will be true to his Bonny Eloise,
  He’s the beau of the Mohawk Vale.

2. Oh! chang’d are the scenes of thy boyhood’s sunny years,
  For the old scenes have chang’d to the new,
And these eyes that smiled on you, have been dim’d with sorrow’s tears,
  Yet no change is there, Harry in you.
Oh! life is a sunshine, amid such scenes as these
  Though your home is crumbling away;
You’ve a home in the heart of your “Bonny Eloise,”
  That never, never will decay.
