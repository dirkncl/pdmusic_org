1.
Down by the deep sad sea,
Down where the sea gulls roam,
I wander on the rock bound shore,
Where stood my boyhood's home.
But years have changed those happy scenes
That once were dear to me,
For all I loved in life now sleep
Down by the deep sad sea.
  For all I loved in life now sleep
  Down by the deep sad sea.

CHORUS
O! the sea, the sad, sad sea,
O! the sea, the deep blue sea,
My love, to thee, I'd give the world to live again,
Down by the deep sad sea.

2.
Down by the deep sad sea,
Eveing shades draw nigh,
I gaze upon its bosom soft
With sad and tearful eye.
And mem'ry takes its wayward flight
To scenes that used to be.
And leave me sitting lone and sad,
Down by the deep sad sea.
  And leave me sitting lone and sad,
  Down by the deep sad sea.

(CHORUS)

3.
Down by the dear old sea,
Morning sweetly smiles,
I see the white sails flitting
Across its breast for miles.
The playfull white caps chase and leap
Each other in their glee;
O! when I die here let me rest,
Down by the deep sad sea.
  O! when I die here let me rest,
  Down by the deep sad sea.

(CHORUS)
