1.
My father has a fortune and I am twenty one,
I flirt with all the pretty girls and I am fond of fun.
I go to balls and parties, and dress myself so well.
The girls can't help exclaiming ah! there's a nobby swell.

CHORUS
I dance, I sing, I drink Champagne, in fact I cannot tell,
which one of all the pretty girls, will suit this nobby swell.

2.
I own the fastest horses that go out to the park,
I never eat my dinner, ah! until 'tis after dark,
I then arrange my toilet, and go to the hotel,
That all the girls can flirt and say: "ah! there's a nobby swell."

(CHORUS)

3.
Sometimes up to the opera or theatre I go:
When I go in, I hear them say, "who's that, I'd like to know"?
I fix my eye on some one, and make of her a belle,
By having the attentions of the gay and nobby swell.

(CHORUS)
