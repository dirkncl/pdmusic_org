1.
Say, how much does the baby weigh?
Happy and free,
It looks like me,
It is only three months old today,
And happy as can be.
I hold it close in my embrace,
And I can see its mother's face;
I see its little rosy cheek,
It smiles as if it tried to speak.

CHORUS
Say, how much does the baby weigh?
Happy and free,
It looks like me,
It is only three month old today,
And happy as can be.

2.
Say, how much does the weigh?
Jolly and gay,
It looks like me,
With its dimpled chin, and its eyes of gray,
And brighter than the day.
See its little upturned nose,
And watch it play with its little toes,
Lift its chubby hands so fair,
Head adorned with curly hair.

(CHORUS)
