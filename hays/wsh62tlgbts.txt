"The Lone Grave by the Sea" (1862)
Written & Composed
by William Shakewspeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
I'm sitting in the cottage door,
Where oft in days gone by,
We've watch'd the wild waves kiss the shore,
My Mother dear and I,
But now I'm left sad and alone,
All that was dear to me.
My mother dear!
I'm weeping by,
The lone grave by the sea,
Along at night I'm kneeling
By the lone grave by the sea.

2.
The pale moon now reflects her light,
While half the world's asleep,
The stars so beautiful and bright
Look's down upon the deep
The murmuring waves come to the shore
And go in playful glee,
To sing a dirge upon the deep
Of the lone grave by the sea,
While I am left alone to weep
O'er the lone grave by the sea.

3.
The flowers that Mother planted there,
Are fading fast away,
They ne'er again will bloom so fair,
The cottage will decay,
But let that cottage be my home
No other give to me,
For I can watch by day and night
The lone grave by the sea,
And when I die oh! let me lie,
Near the lone grave by the sea.
