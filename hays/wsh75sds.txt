1.
Massa an' ole Missus,
Dey done gone away,---
Lef' us in de cabin,
Said dey's qwine to stay;
We's too old to trabel,
Got nowhar to go,---
Han' me down dat fiddle dar,
Hangin on de door.

CHORUS
Oh, we aint got long to stay here, boys,
Make de fiddle ring!
Sound de banjo, blow de horn,
Sing an' dance till tomorrow morn;
Git out, den, an' shuck de corn,---
Sing, darkies, sing!

2.
Cabin it am leakin',
Rain falls in de door.
Coon hide in de chimney,
Dog lays on de floor.
Sun shines in de winder,
Smoke goes froo de roof,---
Cookin' hoocake on de h'a'th,
Darkies, dat's de troof!

(CHORUS)

3.
Don't you hear de banjo,
Fiddle an' de horn?
Hear de darkies singin',
Shuckin' ob de corn;
Darkies, come, go wid me,
I'se a gittin dry,
Sing de chorus, all jine in,
Come back by an' by!

(CHORUS)
