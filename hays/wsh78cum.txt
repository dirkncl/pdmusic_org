"Come Unto Me" (1878)
Sacred Song, Duet, Quartette or Chorus,
Written and Composed
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
O Thou Omnipresent Most High
I turn to Thee with tearful eye
And bow me down on trembling knee
To offer up my prayer to Thee
[DUET. Soprano and Alto]
I feel I am by sin oppressed
My weary soul can find no rest,
And now I turn my Lord to Thee,
For Thou has said, "Come unto Me"
[QUARTETTE]
Before His matchless Throne of Grace
I bow before my Saviour's face,
Though sinner in his sight I be,
'Twas Christ that said "Come unto Me."

2.
This world hath not a charm for those
Whose hearts are bleeding with their woes
So full of grief, so dark with sin
That Heaven lets no sunshine in
[DUET. Soprano and Alto]
But Lord, Thow[u] knowest how I feel,
I pray Thee hear my sad appeal,
From all my sins O set me free,
For Thou hast said, "Come unto Me"
[QUARTETTE]
Before His matchless Throne of Grace
I bow before my Saviour's face,
Though sinner in his sight I be,
'Twas Christ that said "Come unto Me."
