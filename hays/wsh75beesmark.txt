Song and Chorus.
Words and Music
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1917

1.
I've got some tings I shpeak mit you,
Und just because I oughter,
About de way I manage folks,
Away across de water;
I teach de kings and brinces too,
De shtyle dat dey must go,
An' march 'em up, and march 'em down,
Like soldiers in a row.

CHORUS [2 times]
'm Beesmark, big Beesmark,
More bigger as a shteeple,
Unt kings look up when I walk round,
Unt talks like little beeple.

2.
I make de Austrian shkip und chump,
De British shake mit fear,
Und den I winks mit all mine might,
Und drinks mine lager beer;
I give de Frenchman two black eyes,---
He bows 'mid much grimace,
An' grows quite sick, but has to take
Rhine wine unt Switzer case.

(CHORUS 2x)

3.
Und Belgium, and Italy,
Und den de king of Shpain,---
Dey feel below deir waists as if
Dey had a frightful pain;
For Beesmark,--- and dey know it, too,---
Is up and wide awake;
Und if dey don't walk mighty shtaight.
His physic dey must take!

(CHORUS 2x)

4.
Dis world is like one scheckerboard,
Und states mine-pieces are;
I makes a move,--- dey tremble all,---
King, Emperor, and Czar!
De Russian bear his nails I'll pare,
Attention! right about!
I rules de world, shmokes mine pipe,
Und eat mine saurkrout!

(CHORUS 2x)
