1.
Beautiful girl of the South,
Friend of my earlier days,
Fondly I'm thinking of thee,
Loving to sing in thy praise.
We have loved each other,
Nought but death can sever,
Hearts once bound together,
My love one and mine own. Oh!

CHORUS
Beautiful girl of the South (Beautiful girl,)
Say, art thou thinking of me? (Beautiful girl,)
Far, in thine own sunny home, (Beautiful girl,)
Down by the murmuring sea.

2.
Beautiful girl of the South,
Heart that is loving and true,
Face full of innocent smiles.
Eyes of a heavenly blue;
O! many pleasant hours
Amid the southern flowers.
So happy have been ours,
My loved on and mine own. Oh!

(CHORUS)

3.
Beautiful girl of the South,
Birds sing their sweetest to thee,
Songs of their own sunny clime;
Those were the sweetest to me
Would'st thou ask to prove thee,
Smile, sweet girl, above thee
Heaven knows I love thee,
My loved one and mine own. Oh!

(CHORUS)
