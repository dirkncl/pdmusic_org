1.
In tears I wander to and fro,
With worn and weary feet;
For now I have no place to go,
My home is in the street;
I was a mother's pride and care,
But far from her I stray,
Oh, gentle stranger my prayer,
I'm lost, and cast away!

CHORUS (sung after each verse)
No friends! (No friends!)
No home! (No home!)
No joy (No joy) from day (from day) to day!
Sweet Angels pity while I roam,
I'm lost, and cast away.

2.
All night I roam the dreary street,
No place to lay my head;
No pity in each face I meet,
I would that I were dead!
My once true friends, with haughty air,
Pass by me ev'ry day,
They greet me not in my despair,
I'm lost, and cast away!

3.
Mo mother's kiss, no father's smile,
No blessings on my head;
I find 'tis but a little while
Ere I, too, will be dead.
How long, good Angels, must I wait
To hear you sweetly say,
"Come meet us at the pearly gate,
Not lost, nor cast away!"
