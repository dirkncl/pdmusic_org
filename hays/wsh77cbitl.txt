1.
The happy scenes of childhood
Live in my mem'ry still;
The little roofed cottage,
That stood upon the hill;
The fields and woods and meadows,
The old barn filled with grain;
But danger still the music
Of the cowbells in the lane.

CHORUS
I have listen'd to the music,
And heard the sad refrain;
No more I'll hear the music
Of the cowbells in the lane.

2.
When evening shadows gathered,
I need to sit and wait,
Until I saw them coming,
Then go down to the gate;
I'd let them in from pasture,
Till morning to remain;
And nature heard the music
Of the cowbells in the lane.

(CHORUS)

3.
I've heard sweet birds in summer,
I've listen'd to the breeze,
The music of its murmurs,
Among the leafy trees;
I've heard sweet sounds from heaven,
But never hear again
The same oldfashioned music
Of the cowbells in the lane.

(CHORUS)
