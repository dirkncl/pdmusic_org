1.
The moon is out to night love,
Floating thro' the sky,
Little stars are laughing
As she passes by;
All the little songsters
Sing a merry tune--
Happy as they can be
Singing to the moon.
Clouds with silver lining
Waiting in the sky,
For the moon to pass them Kitty, so am I,
For I've come to meet you,
With a happy smile,
To tell you how I love you,
Sitting on the stile.

CHORUS
The moon is out to-night, love,
Meet me with a smile;
I've something sweet to tell you,
Sitting on the stile.
Kiss me when you meet me,
Kitty of the glen;
And when I go to meet you,
I'll give it back again.

2.
The moon is out to night live,
All the roses blush
When the gentle night winds
Tell the birds to hush,
For all I woant to listen
Foa a merry voice
Whose ev-ery note is music
And makes my heart rejoice.
Kitty I am watching,
To see if I can see,
Some one like a fairy coming towards me,
Ah, the little angel
Coming once again,
I've a kiss of true love
For Kitty of the glen.

(CHORUS)
