1.
Lonely and sad is my poor heart tonight,
Loved ones are thinking of me.
O! how I long to be with them again,
And their loved faces to see.
Years have rolled by since I bade them adieu,
Crossed o'er the ocean's blue foam.
Nightly I utter my heart's loving prayer
God bless the loved ones at home
O God bless the loves ones at home.

CHORUS
God bless my mother at home,
God bless my father at home.
Would I could see their dear faces again
O! God bless the loved ones at home.

2.
O! well I remember my mother's sweet face,
The morning I bade her "farewell"
Tears filled her eye when she told me goodbye,
Her face on my young bosom fell;
My father stood by and he wept like a child,
With sad heart I started to roam.
And the angels record my same prayer ev'ry night
God bless the loved ones at home
O God bless the loves ones at home.

(CHORUS)

3.
How oft in my dreams can I see the old house
As it stood on the side of the hill.
The scenes of my boyhood he friends of my youth,
And fresh in my mem'ry still
Each letter I get from the dear ones I love
Brings the message O! why don't you come?
Each one that I send takes a tear and the prayer
God bless the loved ones at home
O God bless the loves ones at home.

(CHORUS)
