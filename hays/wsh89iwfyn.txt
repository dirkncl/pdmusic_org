1. When the evening shadows gather and all nature seeks repose,
  The dewdrops kiss the faces of the  flowers and the rose,
The nightingale is singing to its mate in yonder tree,
  The owl is sitting on a limb and slyly looks at me,
The quiet stars are smiling through the curtains of the night,
  And winking at the gentle moon that takes its wayward flight,
I watch the streamlet murm’ring through the meadows ’round the hill,
  I’m waiting for you, Nora, on the footbridge near the mill.

CHORUS 1-2.
Then meet me darling for yoy know I fondly love you still,
I’m waiting for you, Nora, on the footbridge near the mill.

2. Now the gentle breath of summer makes the leaves dance ’mong the trees,
  Tbe perfume of the clover blossoms fills the evening breeze,
I listen for your merry voice to sing the song again,
  I heard you singing when I met you coming down the lane,
The happiest moments of my life on wings of pleasure fly,
  When nature sets apart a night like this for you and I, 
Come with a kiss, come with a smile, O come I know yiu will,
  I’m waiting for you, Nora, on the footbridge near the mill.
