1.
Poor little bird with its sweet song's of gladness
Death, oh! how cruel to close its bright eye,
Oft has it cheer'd me in hours of sadness,
And only would sing when it knew I was nigh.

Shut up in its cage from the green fields and flowers,
Where most of its kindred were roaming at will,
To sport with each other and sing the gay hours
Away till the night bid them sleep and be still.

CHORUS
Is there a Paradise?
yes 'Tis in Heaven
Where sweet birds assemble to wing away care;
But alas my poor bird, which to Death I have given,
I know will not sing, lest it knows I am there.

2.
Had I unmasked it before it was dying
I knew I would have flown in its liberty free;
Now 'tis too late---it is dead and I'm sighing,
To think that is never will sing more for me.

Oh! Sun melt the earth with thy pure smiles of gladness,
While I find a place for my poor bird to sleep,
That when ever my heart is embalm'd in its sadness
I'll go to its resting place there will I weep.

(CHORUS)
