To Capt. Jno. Kilkenny, Louisville, KY.
"Maggie Lee" (1879)
Song and Chorus with Flute Obligato
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907
(from "Will S. Hays' Latest Songs"
among a group a four others)

1.
In a forest stands a cottage
With its chimney built of clay,
And a little streamlet ripples,
Making music night and day---
Lives a brown-eyed little beauty
Who is all the world to me;
She's as fair as she is faultless,
And her name is Maggie Lee.

CHORUS
Oh I love this modest beauty,
She is fair as fair can be,
She's a perfect little angel,
And her name is Maggie Lee.

2.
When the birds awake the morning
With their songs of joy and mirth,
How they love to sing their sweetest
To the fairest girl on earth,
As she moves among the flowers
Just as if they blushed to see,
The purest one among them
In the beauty Maggie Lee.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the dewdrops kiss the roses
Under cover of the night,
The stars themselves seem smiling
When they see her face so bright,
But she always seems more lovely
When she smiles so sweet on me,
Then I think that earth is heaven,
And my angel, Maggie Lee.

(CHORUS)
