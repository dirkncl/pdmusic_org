"We May Never Meet Again" (1863)
Words and Music
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Sad is this young heart of mine,
No friend to smile on me,
Oh! it was true unto thine;
I never loved but thee,
Yet I am sad as I wander,
Still true to thee I'll remain,
Though it be that we have parted,
We may never meet again.

CHORUS
Fare thee well! forever!
Parting gives me pain,
But oh! 'tis sad to think that we
May never meet again.

2.
Oh! that we never had met,
A happy boy I'd be,
Oh! would that I could forget,
The happy past and thee.
No! I must fondly rembember.
Soon will my fond hopes be slain.
Soon, in my grave I'll be sleeping
We may never meet again.

(CHORUS)
