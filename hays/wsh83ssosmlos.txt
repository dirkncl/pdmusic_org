1.
Angels ever bright and fair,
Look down from the skies,
On the sacred hallowed spot,
Where my loved one lies.
Look in loving merry down,
Nightly vigils keep,
While I bow and whisper low,
Sleep, my loved one sleep.
  While I bow and whisper low,
  Sleep, my loved one sleep.

CHORUS
Angels guard her,
Let her sleep!
Heaven reward her,
Let her sleep!
Let her soul be in Thy care
God is with it "over there"
Angels listen to my prayer,
Sleep, loved one sleep (loved one sleep).

2.
She I loved, most, best of all,
Sleeps beneath the sod,
She was mine, save her pure soul,
That belongs to God.
Now I look to God and pray,
Then bow down and weep,
Only having this to say,
Sleep, my loved one sleep.
  Only having this to say,
  Sleep, my loved one sleep.

(CHORUS)

3.
Let each star a window be,
For an angel face,
Looking down upon this grave
From the Throne of Grace,
Let me lift mine eyes to theirs,
While the teardrops creep,
And they listen to my prayer,
Sleep, my loved one sleep.
  And they listen to my prayer,
  Sleep, my loved one sleep.

(CHORUS)
