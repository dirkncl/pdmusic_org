1.
I lived with Master many years ago,
Way down on de Tombigbee,
I bid farewell to all de darkies den,
Kase de white folks sot me free;
But I'm hungry now, an' my feet am cold,
An' I tremble when de cold wind blows,
I'm a-gwine back dar whar de sun shines warm,
Down dar, whar de sugar cane grows.

CHORUS
I'm a-gwine, (I'm a-gwine,)
I'm a-gwine, (I'm a-gwine,)
I'll neber come away,
I'm a-gwine dar to star,
Down whar de sugar cane grows.

2.
O! I was so happy livin' in de lane,
But dat was many years ago,
All day I'd go and hoe de sugar cane,
An' at night play de ole banjo.
In de cabin now, whar I used to live,
So happy wid my ole wife Rose,
She will meet me dar, an' we'll be so glad,
Down dar, whar de sugar cane grows.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'll stay wid Master balance ob my days,
Way down on de Tombigbee,
If I git dar, I'll never leave again,
'Till Death comes along for me.
O! I'll stick to de hoe, 'till de sun goes down,
An' I'll rise when de rooster crows,
I will spend my life, wid my good ole wife,
An' die whar de sugar cane grows.

(CHORUS)
