			DEDICATION.

It gives me pleasure to dedicate this little
		volume to my fiend,
		W. N. HALDEMAN, Esq.

I have two Friends I dearly love,
  With fond affection true;
One dwells in Heaven, one on earth--
  One God, the other you.

And when you go to God's great gate,
  As you will surely do,
May angels with their sweetest songs
  Be there to welcome you.

For you have been a friend to me--
  The best I ever knew,
And in my heart there is a place
  Of tender love for you.

As down toward the door of Death
  My journer I pursue,
I'll never cease to think
  Of such a friend as you.

May God among His matchless crowns,
  Select one the choicest two;
Save one for me, and then reserve
  The brightest one for you.

			THE AUTHOR.
