1.
Thou whom my heart can love alone,
It is to thee I sing,
I fain would claim thee as mine own,
To thee my love would bring,
If but those soft blue eyes of thine
Would only shed their beams
Across this lonely path of mine,
Sweet angel of my dreams,
Across this lonely path of mine,
Sweet angel of my dreams.

CHORUS
Sweet angel, (Sweet angel,)
sweet angel (sweet angel,)
Sweet angel of my dreams;
To love thee is a fault of mine,
Sweet angel of my dreams.

2.
Thou whom I love so fond, so true,
How happy I would be,
If I was loved or only knew
You had one thought for me,
My heart with all its love is thine,
How strange yet true it seems,
To love thee is a fault of mine,
Sweet angel of my dreams,
To love thee is a fault of mine,
Sweet angel of my dreams.

CHORUS
Sweet angel, (Sweet angel,)
sweet angel (sweet angel,)
Sweet angel of my dreams;
To love thee is a fault of mine,
Sweet angel, sweet angel, sweet angel,
Sweet angel of my dreams.
