1.
Good bye to drink;
Glad is my heart,
To think forever tonight we shall part,
Grateful I leave thee, my heart is in joy,
To feel that your poison no more shall destroy.
O scenes of temptation, forever adieu,
Ne'er will my memory wander to you.
Tell all my lov'd ones I'm sav'd from the brink;
Forever I leave thee,
Good bye! to Drink!

CHORUS
Pledge of my heart, years may come,
But from thy blessings no more shall I roam.
Rum, we must part,
In thy pow'r defy!
How happy I bid thee, foul drink, Good bye!

2.
Good bye to drink;
Out on life's sea
Mine eyes will grow brighter unfetter'd by thee,
Think of the joys of Temp'rance in store!
I smile when I think that thy bondage is o'er.
I'll miss not the sound of the revelling crew
As I now to the past and its woes bid adieu!
For once more a man will I sail from Death's brink;
Forever I leave thee,
Good bye! to Drink!

(CHORUS)

3.
Good bye to drink;
Tears fill mine eyes,
To think how it sever'd affectionate ties,
Lost me the love of the friends I loved true,
Who sleep in their graves, who in childhood I knew.
I've still one to love me,
I've still one to cheer,
For life now to me is be this pledge made dear!
Kept shall it be till iin Death's arms I sink!
Forever I leave thee,
Good bye! to Drink!

(CHORUS)
