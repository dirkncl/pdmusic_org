1. O how happy I used to be,
  In dem good ole days,
’Way down yonder on de Tombigbee,
  In dem good ole days.
When I worked all day in de cotton and de cane,
  An’ I libed in de ole log cabin in de lane,
I was happier den dan I’ll eber be again,
  In dem good ole days.

CHORUS 1-2.
Den good bye to de ole plantation,
  Goodbye to de cabin in de lane,
For dey sot us all free,
  My good ole wife and me,
Will nebber see dem good time again.

2. I used to go by de light ob de moon,
  In dem good ole days,
An’ hunt wid de dogs for de possum and de coon,
  In dem good ole days.
But Ise nebber been so happy since dey sot me free,
  An’ I wish I was libin’ on de Tombigbee,
For ole marster and missus wuz so  kind to me,
  In dem good ole days.
