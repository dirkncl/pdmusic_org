1.
Near yonder stream that flows so free,
  Where storms can never rave,
Beneath a drooping willow tree,
  Is gentle Annie's grave.
My heart is sad for Annie dear,
  She's left me here alone,
And o'er her grave I weep a tear,
  For Annie's lost and gone.

CHORUS
She's gone, she's gone, we'll shed a tear,
O'er gentle Annie's grave,
We'll never forget in mem'ry dear,
Who sleeps where flowers wave.

2.
Alas! my gentle Annie's gone,
  She'll roam with me no more,
We ne'er can wander here alone,
  As we have done before,
Where I have plucked the flowers of spring
  And placed them in her hair,
The little birds yet sweetly sing
  But Annie is not there.

(CHORUS)
