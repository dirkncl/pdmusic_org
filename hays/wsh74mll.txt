1.
Oh! troubled heart! I pray, be calm,
No one can tell how sad I am,
My heart is breaking with its grief,
A woe is mine beyond relief,
Oh! stay! ye tears! That fill my eyes,
While I look once toward the skies,
And call my child on bended knees,
My own, my lost, Louise, Louise!

CHORUS
Oh! stay! ye tears! that fill mine eyes,
While I look once beyond the skies,
And call my child on bended knees,
My own, my lost Louise (Louise).

2.
Ye angels 'round the Pearly Gate,
How long must I, her mother wait,
'Ere I can find that place of rest
To fold my darling to my breast?
A bright and beauteous star I see,
Is it her face, that smiles on me?
Are those her lips? Speak to me, please,
My sweet, my child, Louise, Louise!

(CHORUS)

3.
No! no! a crown is on her brow,
No more she's mine but heaven's now.
Oh! if 'twere but a little while,
That I could see me own dear child,
To fold her once in my embrace,
And look upon her angel face,
The terror, Death, might come and seize
My child, my child, Louise, Louise!

(CHORUS)
