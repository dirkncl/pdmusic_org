1.
I meet my love by moonlight,
When stars are in the skies,
And lips exchanged their kisses,
And eyes make love to eyes.
Her voice is like sweet music,
Her step light as the fawn,
And oh! we are so happy,
When we'er walking on the lawn.

CHORUS
Oh! I am so happy
When she's smiling in my eyes,
Whispering her love to me,
Beneath the starry skies;
No one near to listen to us,
As we wander on,
Happy in each other's love,
Walking on the lawn.

2.
The summer winds are sighing,
The weather it is fair,
The song birds of the evening,
Make music in the air.
The nightengale is merry,
The daylight it is gone,
And I am with the one I love,
Out walking on the lawn.

(CHORUS)

3.
She told me that she loved me,
I told her she was fair,
I asked her if she'd have me,
And kissed her then and there;
So we are to be married,
Before the summer's gone,
And ev'ry pretty night you'll see
Us walking on the lawn.

(CHORUS)
