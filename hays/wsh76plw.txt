1.
Poor little wanderer, why do you roam
Out in the streets tonight? have you no home?
Have you no shoes for your cold little feet?
Why are you begging for something to eat?
Why do you wear such a thin little gown,
Roaming about through the streets of the town?
Mother is dead! and you father dead, too?
Poor little wanderer, who cares for you?

CHORUS
Pity the fatherless hungry and poor;
Don't drive the motherless child from you door---
Only a poor little beggar, 'tis true;
Poor little wanderer, God cares for you.

2.
Poor little wanderer, where do you sleep?
Are you unhappy, child? why do you weep?
When you lie down, do you sigh all alone?
Mourning for dear ones departed and gone?
Who tells you ever to kneel down and pray,
And ask God to hear ev'ry word that you say?
I look in your sad face, so gentle and true---
Poor little wanderer, who cares for you?

(CHORUS)

3.
Poor little wanderer, lift up your eyes;
Some one is watching you now from the skies,
Is it not mother and father?---ah, yes!
Watching their child in this world's wilderness,
Waiting up there for their darling to come,
Angels are ready to welcome you home;
They'll guide you and keep you, your long journey through;
Keep you eyes heavenward---God cares for you!

(CHORUS)
