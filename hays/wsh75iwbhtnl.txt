1.
Far from home I have strayed,
Out upon life's stormy sea,
Still I've remembered that home,
Fondly I've thought, love, of thee;
And of the little ones, too,
Smiling with faces so bright,
Soon they'll be happy, I know,
For I will be home, love, to-night!

CHORUS
I will be home, love, to-night! (I'll be home!)
I will be home, love, to-night! (I'll be home!)
Meet me with smiles where I left thee in tears,
For I will be home, love, to-night! (home to-night!)

2.
Oh! how I long for thy smiles,
And for one loving embrace,
And how my heart will be glad,
When I behold thy sweet face;
Sadness that once filled my heart,
Soon will make room for delight,
Loved ones will soon see me now,
For I will be home, love, to-night!

(CHORUS)

3.
Oft in my dreams have I seen
Faces like angels so fair,
Looking so happy at home;
O! how I've sighed to be there!
Sit in the door, wait and watch,
Keep in the window a light,
Tell all the loved ones to wait
For I will be home, love, to-night!

(CHORUS)
