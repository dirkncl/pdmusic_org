1.
Sound de banjo, blow de horn,
I’m gwine away tomorrow morn.
Ole massa’s dar, an he sent for me,
To come way down to Tennessee.
I’ll leave de cabin in de lane
In charge of Hannah Maria Jane,
Kase I’m a comin’ back again.
Good-bye, boys, good-bye!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Goodbye, uncle Caleb,
Shake hands all around,
Hope you’ll live for a thousand years,
An’ weigh four hundred pounds.

2. I pulled de canoe on de shore,
I won’t hab use for dat no more;
I give old Han-nah Jane de gun,
I’ll let de coon and da pos-sum run.
I’m gwine to let dis ole dog free,
He’s been a faithful dog to me,
When I come back, how fat he’ll be.
Good-bye, boys, good-bye!

3. Tune de fiddle, sound de drum,
Play de tune ob de kingdom come,
Sing an’ dance wid de ole banjo,
Can’t stay here, for I got to go.
I leave you all in de early morn,
I’ll come back here, sure’s you born,
Unless ole Gabriel blows his horn.
Goodbye, boys, goodbye!
