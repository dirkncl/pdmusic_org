1.
Come and sit beside me,
Little one of mine,
Let your eyes upon me,
In their beauty shine;
Put your arms around me,
Once before we part,
Kiss me for your mother,
Bless you little heart!

CHORUS
Don't forget me, Nellie,
Kiss me ere I start,
Don't forget me, darling,
Bless your little heart!

2.
Come and let me tell you
Where your mother's gone,
Up among the angels,
God has made her one;
Do you not remember
How the tears did start,
When she said, "My darling,
Bless your little heart!"

(CHORUS)

3.
When I'm gone, my darling,
What a joy 'twill be,
Knowing that you're praying
Ev'ry night for me;
And when my petitions
Heavenward depart,
I will ask the angels,
To bless your little heart!

(CHORUS)
