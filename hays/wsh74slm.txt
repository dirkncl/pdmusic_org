1.
Child of sweet beauty! the dearest to me,
Voice full of music and innocent mirth,
Joyfully dandied on grandpapa's knee,
Grandmamma's sweet little darling of earth,
Mamma sits watching you,---her's to adore;
Papa says cheerfully, "Come along, come!"
All watch you playfully crawling the floor,
The idol and sunshine of home!

CHORUS
May! May! Sweet little May!
Long may you live ere the angels will come
Smiling, singing, taking away
The idol and sunshine of home.

2.
Oh! how I love you, my dear little one!
When my life's clouded with moments of care,
Then you face, smiling as bright as the sun,
Makes me forget that a sorrow was there.
Watching my portrait that hangs on the wall,
Smiling at me and at those in the room,
Trying to walk, how we laugh when you fall,
Bright idol and sunshine of home!

(CHORUS)

3.
Go to your mama, and in her embrace
Softly she'll fold you upon her proud breast;
Smiling so lovingly into her face,
Plead like a bird that is lost from its nest.
Dream in her arms till she puts you away;
Sleep, till the beautiful morning will come;
Wake when you hear or shout, "Where's little May?"
The idol and sunshine of home!

(CHORUS)
