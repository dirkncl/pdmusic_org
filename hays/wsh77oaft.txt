1.
In a graveyard silent lone, and drear,
Where the dead in their white robes sleep,
I saw a grave--'twas a little one--
And a woman o'er it weep.
She sighed and wept, like her heart would break,
And she knelt as one in prayer,
When she went away, I looked and say
Only a flower there.

CHORUS
No marble slab, or stately stone,
to mark the lone grave, where
A child, a mother's darling, slept,
only a flower there.

2.
The evening shadows came and dwelt,
Till the twinkling stars so bright,
Looked sweetly down on that grassy mound,
And they kept their watch all night.
And dewdrops fell, like tears from the eyes
Often angels, bright and fair,
As they looked, and saw on that little grave,
Only a flower there.

(CHORUS)

3.
It was all that mother had to give,
As the tears streamed down her face,
It was heaven's gift,--and 'twas her's to give,--
To mark the sacred place.
God gave the child, and He made the flowers,
And He'll watch with tender care;
He'll save the soul of the child, and leave,
Only a flower there.

(CHORUS)
