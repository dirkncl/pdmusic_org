1.
Take this letter to my mother,
For across the deep blue sea,
It will fill her heart with pleasure,
She'll be glad to hear from me.
How she wept when last we parted,
How her heart was filled with pain,
When she said, "goodbye, God bless you,---
We may never meet again."

CHORUS
Take this letter to my mother,
Far across the deep blue sea,
It will fill her heart with pleasure,
She'll be glad to hear from me.

2.
Take this letter to my mother,
It will fill her heart with joy,
Tell her that her prayers are answered,
God protects her absent boy/
Tell her to be glad and cheerful,
Pray for me where'er I roam,
And ere long I'll turn my footsteps
Back towards my dear old home.

(CHORUS)

3.
Take this letter to my mother,
It is filled with words of love,
If on earth I'll never meet her,
Tell her that we'll meet above.
Where there is no hour of parting,
All is peace, and love, and joy,
God will bless my dear old mother,
And protect her only boy.

(CHORUS)
