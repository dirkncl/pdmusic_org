1.
Oh! I have met a charmer,
She's sweet to gaze upon,
The first time that you see her face,
You feel your heart is gone,
She wears her dress "so pan-nier,"
She's neither short or tall,
And of all the charming girls in town
She's the sweetest of them all.

CHORUS
Oh! my! Oh! dear!
You may talk about your pretty girls,
The fair, fat, short and tall,
But Nancy Ann Amanda Jane,
Is the sweetest of them all.

2.
She plays upon the Pia-no
The Jews-harp and "bas-soon"
And when she has-'nt got a cold
Sings "Up in a Balloon,"
She goes to balls and parties
And when her name they call
The men all look around to see
The sweetest of them all.

(CHORUS)

3.
I asked her if she'd have me
She smiled and said "you bet,"
Then whisper'd sweetly in my ear
"We may be happy yet;"
There's going to be a wedding
Some time late in the Fall,
And I'm to be the better half
Of the sweetest of them all.

(CHORUS)

4.
I'm going to build a mansion
With a big plate on the door,
And put my name upon it,
A. Jemims Ersins Moore;
I'm going to give a party
And invite you folks to call
And see how happy I will be
With the sweetest of them all.

(CHORUS)
