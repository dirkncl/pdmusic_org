"Song of the Sewing Machine" (1869)
Written & Composed
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Inventive Genies gave to man
Things pleasing to the sight,
And such as man has often wished
Would make his labors light,
Then turned to woman with a smile
And made her heart rejoice,
For she in ev'ry household sings
Its praises with her voice.

CHORUS
'Tis the song (of the sewing machine,)
'Tis the song (of the sewing machine,)
In ev'ry home wherever 'tis seen, (The FLORESCE machine,)
There's a song (of the sewing machine,)
There's a song (of the sewing machine,)
Of the beautiful FLORESCE machine.

2.
When women toiled for daily bread
From early morn 'till eve
How many eyes were dimmed with tears
How many hearts did grieve;
But now she has her "household pet,"
And one to which she'll cling,
For labor is a pleasure now,
And she can toil and sing.

(CHORUS)

3.
In ev'ry home, in ev'ry land,
Its praise is sung aloud,
It works alike for rich and poor
The humble and the proud;
It is the pride of ev'ry heart
And ev'ry woman's care,
"God bless the men who made it,"
Is in ev'ry woman's prayer.

(CHORUS)
