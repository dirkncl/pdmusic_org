1.
The rustling leaves were calmed to rest,
The dewdrops kissed the rose,
The nightengale sat in his nest,
And nature sought repose,
The stars their tears of pity shed,
The night winds sadly sighed
When we stood 'round his dying bed,--
The night my father died.

CHORUS
His peaceful spirit took its flight,
An angel for its guide;
Ah! how can we forget that night,--
Then night my father died.

2.
His long gray hair in ringlets lay
About his wrinkled brow,
He moved his lips as if to say,
"I'm almost ready now,"
They laid his hands across his breast
And gathered by his side,
He said "good bye," you know the rest,--
The night my father died.

(CHORUS)

3.
My poor old mother kissed his cheek,
The last sad kiss of hers,
She prayed that he might only speak
Or see her parting tears,
But no! death would no longer wait,
His patience had been tried;
His soul passed through the pearly gait--
The night my father died.

(CHORUS)
