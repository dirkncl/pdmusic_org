1.
Come and kiss me, Lennie darling,
Let a smile beam in you eye;
Call me once again your darling,
Do not leave me with a sigh.
For 'tis but a cloud that's passing,
All behind it wears a smile,
Don't be looking sad and lonely,
'Twill be over after while.

CHORUS
Come, my loved one, I am waiting,
Do not break my loving heart, Ah! 
Come and kiss me, Lennie darling,
For tomorrow we must part.

2.
Come and kiss me, Lennie darling,
Do no leave me to regret,
That I ever loved so fondly,
Oh! forgive me and forget.
Let your lips, so warm with kisses,
Speak one word of love to me,
Tell me that you love me, darling,
Oh! how happy I will be.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come and kiss me, Lennie darling,
Let no sorrow deck your brow;
If you ever loved me, darling,
Smile once more and kiss me now.
For we part, perhaps forever,
Life seems dark to you and me,
Will you come once more and kiss me,
Love, or part! which shall it be?

(CHORUS)
