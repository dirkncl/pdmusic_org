1.
Where the mocking bird sang sweetly
Many years ago,
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms
Grew as white as snow,
There I never thought that sorrow,
Grief nor pain would come,
E'er to crush the joys and pleasures
Of my sunny home.

CHORUS
Oh! I'm weeping,
Lonely I must roam.
Must I leave thee,
Dear old sunny home?

2.
Flowers withered, roses drooping,
'Round the cottage door,
And the birds that sang so sweetly,
Sing, alas, no more.
Ev'ry thing comes chang'd in Nature,
Since I cross'd the foam,
To my return, my poor heart breaking,
To my sunny home.

(CHORUS)

3.
Other forms and stranger faces,
All that I can see,
Brings to mem'ry thoughts of loved ones
Who were dear to me.
But my poor heart sinks within me
When I turn to roam,
Far from all I lov'd and cherish'd,
Good bye, sunny home.

(CHORUS)
