1.
De Bob Lee am a bully boat,
Jang morang ohay,
De fastest one dat ever float,
Jang morang ohay!
When you see her climb dat stream,
Jang morang ohay!
Look out den she's usin' steam,
Jang morang ohay!

CHORUS
Den far you well
An' don't you look for me,
We gwine up to de bends an' back
On de bully boat Bob Lee.

2.
Shove dem chunks in de fire door,
Jang morang ohay,
Send de big waves all ashore,
Jang morang ohay!
Slow boats gwine to let her be,
Jang morang ohay!
Got no use for de Bad Bob Lee,
Jang morang ohay!

(CHORUS)

3.
De Captain's up on de bier deck,
Jang morang ohay,
Lookin' our for a boat I spec',
Jang morang ohay!
Dar ain't no boat dat he kin see,
Jang morang ohay!
Dat git away wid de ole Bob Lee.
Jang morang ohay!

(CHORUS)

4.
I hear dem wheels go 'round an' 'round,
Jang morang ohay,
Dat makes dis boat run like a hound,
Jang morang ohay!
De white folks shout on shore wid glee,
Jang morang ohay!
Just lookee yonder at dat Lee.
Jang morang ohay!

(CHORUS)

5.
Ole Captain Cannon he's about,
Jang morang ohay,
An' tole Mass Perkins let her out,
Jang morang ohay!
To see how fast dat boat can be,
Jang morang ohay!
And dey gib dem horns to de Bad Bob Lee.
Jang morang ohay!

(CHORUS)
