1.
I am lonely as I wander
Far across the deep blue sea,
For I'm thinking, of the loved ones,
Who are all the world to me.
They are watching, waiting, wishing,
In their hearts that I would come,
While I am sadly thinking of
Wife, little ones and home.

CHORUS
My poor heart's sad and lonely,
No matter where I roam,
I weep and wish that I could see
Wife[,] little ones, and home.

2.
I can see the old brown Cottage
In the quiet shady nook,
I can hear the sweet birds singing,
And the music of the brook.
And I hear the childrens voices
In my dreams where'er I roam,
And I often see the picture
Of Wife[,] little ones and home.

(CHORUS)

3.
I have written them a letter,
It will make their hearts rejoice,
They will watch and wait to see me,
They will listen for my voice.
And tomorrow, I will hasten,
Back across the oceans foam,
To see my wife and little ones
All happy and at home.

(CHORUS)
