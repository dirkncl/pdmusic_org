1.
O! the summer winds are sighing o'er the meadow, hill and vale,
And nature seems to listen to the merry nightingale,
While I sit and hear the zephyrs and the music of the rill,
And think of you so far away dear to my memory still;
I'll ne'er forget the quiet stars, look'd on us from the skies,
It seem'd your heart was breaking as the tears fell from your eyes,
And the last fond look you gave me, fill'd my loving heart with pain,
You said "good bye" and kiss'd me, love, down yonder in the lane.

CHORUS
Oh! Jennie, fairest flower, I will think of you,
My heart still loves you dearly and with fond affection true,
And I long to see your smiling eyes, and blushing face again,
To meet you where I met you last, down yonder in the lane.

2.
O! I'll never never cease to think how kind you were to me,
When you and I together lov'd before I cross'd the sea,
And the letter which you gave me Jennie, ere I did depart,
I've read so often that I've learn'd to know it all be heart;
But oh! I miss the kisses sweet, the loving soft embrace,
And I would give the world to see your bright and lovely face;
Though I am far away from you, contented I'll remain,
I'm thinking that we'll meet again down yonder in the lane.

(CHORUS)

3.
O! it won't be long ere I'll return across the deep blue sea,
And when I reach my native shore how happy I will be,
And my heart will overflow with joy to meet you with a smile,
Where flowers grow in summer time down by the mossy stile;
So let your heart be happy, love, for mine is ever true,
The only love it ever had was that which clings to you;
O our meeting will be full of joy as parting was of pain,
When we gave heart for heart, that night, down yonder in the lane.

(CHORUS)
