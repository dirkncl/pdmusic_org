1.
Robin, tell Willie I'm waiting;
The beautiful stars shine so bright,
The moon's gentle rays are now beaming,
And Nature seems silent tonight;
I'm waiting alone by the meadow,
And lean on the little old gate
Where I've met him so oft in the moonlight,
Where often I've promised to wait.

CHORUS
Go, Robin, tell Willie I'm waiting,
I'm longing to see him, I own;
Go tell him I wait at the little old gate;
I'm watching and waiting alone.

2.
Robin, tell Willie I'm waiting;
The moments passing away;
I know that he'd hasten to meet me
If he knew I had something to say;
He knows in his heart that I love him,
He told me last night he lov'd me;
Go tell him I'm lonely without him,
And wait near the old elm tree.

(CHORUS)

3.
Robin, tell Willie I'm waiting;
The owl sits and winks at the moon,
The birds and their mates now are happy,
The nightingale whistles a tune;
But I am unhappy and lonely,
My heart loses all its delight,
If you won't go and tell him I'm waiting,
Then, Robin, tell Willie "Good night."

(CHORUS)
