1.
Oh! the sun smil'd a farewell to evening
And then hid its beautiful face,
While the moon leap'd the sky in its beauty,
Adorning the bright world of space,
The sweet little stars took their places,
And smiled as they ne'er smiled before.
For I look'd at their beautiful faces,
And that of sweet Mary O'More.

CHORUS
O would that to night I were with thee,
My heart would no longer implore
The blessing of seeing and loving
My beautiful Mary O'More.

2.
Oh! I thought of the thatch cover'd cottage,
And the door that look'd out on the sea,
And a face looking out of the window,
And a memory thinking of me,
And a tear from my sad eye came creeping,
As I thought of the time in the door,
When I took the fond heart in my keeping,
Of my beautiful Mary O'More.

(CHORUS)

3.
It is manny long years since I've seen her,
And a voice to my heart oft has said,
"Do you know what's become of poor Mary?
Can you tell is she living or dead?"
No, no, all I know is I love her,
How oft have I told her before,
And I pray the good angels above her,
May bless my own Mary O'More.

(CHORUS)
