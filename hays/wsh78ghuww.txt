1.
We are a band of brothers, and we gain the world's applause,
By standing by each othere in our grand and noble cause,
We've signed the pledge, to drink no more, our promise we'll fulfil.
And live as sober, better me, "God helping us";-- we will.

CHORUS
Come, sign the pledge, boys, come and join our band,
Come, sign the pledge, boys, Give us your hand,
Come sign the pledge, boys, "God helping you,"
Come, join the army, wear the red badge, or blue.

2.
Our army is a mighty one, as we go marching on,
Our war upon Intemperance is scarcely yet begun.
We'll fave the foe at ev'ry turn, and boldly fight him still,
Until we've conquered him at last, "God helping me";-- we will.

(CHORUS)

3.
No longer are we slaves to drink, but masters to control,
The right and pow'r to ever shun Intoxication's bowl,
We'll march along with steady step, and climb the "Golden Hill."
And plant our banners on the top, "God helping us;"-- we will.

(CHORUS)
