1. Farewell mother home and friends,
We may never meet again,
Soon ’mid strangers I must roam,
Oh! the parting gives me pain,
Tho’ I wander far away,
Lonely o’er life’s stormy sea;
Who will shed one gentle tear,
For a wand’ring refugee,
  Who will shed one gentle tear,
  For a wand’ring refugee.

CHORUS 1-2.
Mother, oh! farewell!
I must go, I’ll think of thee, Oh!
Mother, I must leave thee now,
I’m a wand’ring refugee.

2. Farewell sunny southern home,
Home I always lov’d so true
Oft’ will teardrops sim mine eyes,
When my mem’ry flies to you,
But the happy scenes of yore,
I alas will never see,
I’ll be roaming far away
A lonely wand’ring refugee.
  I’ll be roaming far away
  A lonely wand’ring refugee.
