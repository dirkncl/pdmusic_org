"Keep in de Middle ob de Road" (1878)
Song & Chorus
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
[Solo]
I hear dem angels a callin' loud,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
Dey's a waitin' dar in a great big crowd,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
I see dem stand roun' de big white gate,
We must trabble along 'fore we git too late,
Fo' t'aint no use fo' to sit down and wait,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.

CHORUS
Den, chil'ren, keep in de middle ob de road,
Den, chil'ren, keep in de middle ob de road,
Don't you look to de right, don't you look to the left,
But keep in de middle ob de road.

2.
[Solo]
I ain't got time fo' to stop an' talk,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
Kase de road am rough, an' its hard to walk,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
I'll fix my eyes on de golden stair,
An' I'll keep on a gwine till I git dar,
Kase my head am bound fo' de crown to w'ar,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.

(CHORUS)

3.
[Solo]
Come an' fine in de weary ban',
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
Kase we bound fo' home in de happy land,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
Turn your back on dis world ob sin,
Knock at de door an' dey'll let you in,
Kase you'll nebber git such a chance ag'in,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.

(CHORUS)

4.
[Solo]
Dis world am full ob sinful things,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
When de feet gits tired, put on de wings,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.
[Solo]
Ef you lay down on de road to die,
An' you watch dem angels in de sky,
You kin put on wings an' git up an' fly,
[Chorus]
Keep in de middle ob de road.

(CHORUS)
