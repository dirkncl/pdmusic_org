1.
Oh, cast away the winecup,
For by it you are bound
To suffer all the sorrows
That in this life are found
The woes and fears and bitter tears
You never knew before,
O! cast it off forever, do,
And don't drink any more, O!

CHORUS 2 times
Don't drink any more,
Don't drink any more,
Be a man, now while you can
And don't drink any more.



2.
Oh, stop and think of dear ones,
Who love you as their life,
And think of home and children,
But, most of all, your wife.
And do not roam away from home,
At night don't leave your door
But make your home a happy one,
And don't drink any more, O!

(CHORUS 2x)

3.
Oh, cast away the winecup,
You have a soul to save,
And don't disgrace your family,
Now fill a drunkard's grave.
So change your plan, now while you can,
And let the past be o'er,
With firm resolve, O! be a man,
And don't drink any more, O!

(CHORUS 2x)
