1.
O stars of Heaven, look on me,--
Don't weep, for pity's sake;
But smile, oh, smile as I look up,
Or my poor heart will break;
For I have lost my friend of friends,
And in my dark despair,
I turn my tearful eyes to thee,
And ask, "Is mother there?"

CHORUS
I saw them lay her in the grave
With tender, loving care,
But oh! there is a still, small voice,
That says she is not there.

2.
O angels, let each lovely star
Be as a window bright,
Through which you look in pity down
Upon my form tonight,--
And hear me, on my bended knees,
Appeal to you in prayer,
To look among your band and see,
Oh, say, is mother there?

(CHORUS)

3.
O Thou! great King of earth and sea,
Of heaven and of space!
Oh, canst Thou see among the group
My angel mother's face?
Oh! speak to my poor, troubled soul,
That I may now prepare
To meet her at the "pearly gates,"
Oh, speak, is mother there?

(CHORUS)
