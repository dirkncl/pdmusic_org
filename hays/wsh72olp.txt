1. I’ve a little household angel,
Scarcely old enough to walk,
Oh, ’twould fill your heart with pleasure
If you’d hear her try to talk;
She has eyes just like her mother’s,
They are bright and black as jet,
And she smiles so arch and cunning,
When we call her “little Pet.”

CHORUS 1-3.
She’s the sweetest little darling
That your eyes have ever met,
She’s the idol of her Mother,
And her Father’s little pet.

2. I have sat for hours watching,
When she’d play upon the floor,
And I’ve asked myself the question,
“Could a mortal wish for more?”
Oh! I’ve mever known a sorrow,
Am a stranger to regret,
For my wife and I are happy
With our darling little pet.

3. She’s the sunlight of our being,
She’s the joy of all our days!
And she charms our hearts with gladness
By her sweet and winning ways!
When I see her playing near me,
When I hear her genrle mirth,—
Oh, I think she is an angel,
Who has wander’d down to earth.
