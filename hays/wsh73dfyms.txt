1.
Gude bye, Sandie, take my blessin',
God be wi' ye an the sea,
When ye've crossed the stormy ocean,
Send a letter hame to me.
Oh! how glad I'll be to get it,
It will fill my heart wi' glee,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Dinna forget to think o' me,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Dinna forget to think o' me.

2.
When ye're far awa' an' lanely,
Folka will ask fro' whence ye cam,
Dinna forget yer poor auld mither,
Wham ye've left alane at hame.
When ye lift yer e'es to Heaven,
An' ye pray an bended knee,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Dinna forget to think o' me,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Dinna forget to think o' me.

3.
Bess, your darlin', called to see me---
Wi' her bonnie smiles she came,
First she kiss'd me, then she asked me,
"Wehn is Sandie comin' home?"
Sandie, how the lassie lo'es ye---
Lo's still sparkles from her e'e,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Lo'e sweet Bess to the day ye d'e,
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Lo'e sweet Bess to the day ye d'e.

4.
Tak' the Gude Book which I gi'e ye,
It will guide ye ev'rywhere,
When ye're sick, or when ye're troubled,
You can find sweet comfort there.
Bessie says to make haste hameward---
She is lanesame, sae am I---
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Bessie sends a kiss---gude bye!
Dinna forget yer mither, Sandie,
Bessie sends a kiss---gude bye!
