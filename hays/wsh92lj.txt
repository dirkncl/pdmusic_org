1. I know a brightfaced little lad,
Where heart is full of joy,
He in his mother’s darling pet,
And papa’s baby boy;
His merry voice, wheree’r he goes,
The sweetest echoes wake,
And all, who see him fall in love
With handsome “Little Jake.”

CHORUS 1-3.
Oh, may his cup of joy be full,
No bread of sorrow break;
May health and fortune smile upon
The life of “Little Jake.”

2. He is the light and life of hiome,
Where’re his parents are,
The pet of all who see him on
The steamer “Guiding Star;”
An angel where he is asleep,
A darling when awake,
The pet of women, pride of men,
Is happy ”Little Jake.”

3. Oh, may be live through life to be
An honor to his name,
And may his footsteps lead him on
To fortune and to fame,
And when his soul shall put on wings,
Its upward flight shall take,
May angels gather at God’s gate,
To welcome “Little Jake.”
