1.
Sweet Molly McGuire, my darling, don't leave me,
I'm sure that I love you, oh! why should we part?
The tears fill my eyes when I think that you'll leave me,
Leave me to love with a poor broken heart,
I long for a smile of your bright eyes that glisten,
The sound of your voice that I've heard oft before,
The kiss of affection and true love, oh! listen,
Sweet Molly McGuire, come, open your door.

CHORUS
Mollie, dear Mollie, hear me, my darling,
Come but the once, and I'll ask you no more;
The bright stars are waking, my poor heart is breaking,
O!, Molly McGuire, come, open your door.

2.
Sweet Molly McGuire, the first time I met you,
You taught me to love you, and said you'd be true;
Now why would you have me to go and forget you,
O! what with a poor broken heart can I do?
How happy was I when you used to sit near me,
And smile when you'd tell me your love o'er and o'er!
If ever you loved me, I beg of you hear me,
Dear Mollie McGuire, come, open your door.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh! Molly McGuire, my heart is yours, take it,
I've come back to love you, I'm true to you still.
Come back to me, darling, and mend it, or crush it,
You taught it to love you, now, do what you will.
Come, while the beams of the bright stars are falling,
Come, let me tell you I love you, once more,
Come, and don't turn a deaf ear to my calling,
Oh! Mollie McGuire, I'll die at your door.

(CHORUS)
