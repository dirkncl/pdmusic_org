1.
Alone, and at home, with no one to love,
Mother and child with the angels above,
No one to love me, none to caress,
Left all alone in this world's wilderness.
Sorrow now lingers where once joy did dwell,
Shadows of death o'er my happiness fell;
While they are waiting for me to come,
I am so weary, alone, and at home!

CHORUS
Alone and at home, once happy home!
Alone, and at home, alone at home!

2.
Alone, and at home, once dear to me,
Made glad by faces once I could see;
Voices like music gladden'd each room,
Gone to the grave, leaving home all in gloom.
Where are the forms of my loved wife and child,
Where are the eyes that so oft on my smiled?
Ah! they have gone with the angels to roam,
Leaving me weeping, alone, and at home!

(CHORUS)

3.
Alone, and at home, here let me dwell---
Here where I lived with the ones loved so well;
Now they have gone, and it never can be
The same happy home that it once was to me!
Here let me sit all alone in the door,
Thinking of those who will come back no more;
When I am called, and they beckon to come,
I'll be found waiting, alone, and at home!

(CHORUS)
