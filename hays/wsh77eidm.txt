When de good ole Gabriel gwine to blow de horn,
You'd better be dar sure as you are born,
For he gwine to wake you early in de morn,

He's a gwine to wake you early in de morin',

Kase dar aint a gwine to be no scrougin' 'round de gate,

Chorus.
He's a gwine to meet you in de mornin'.

Den rise, chil'ren sing around de door,
We'll gadder early on de golden shore,
He's a comin' right now, an he'll come no more,
He's a gwine to meet us early in de mornin'.

You'd better take a front seat in de golden car,
Kase Gabriel an' de debbil gwine to hab a war,
Come an' gine de army and let him see you dar,
He's a gwine to meet you early in de mornin',

Got up a shoutin', don't be found asleep,
De road is pretty rough, an de hill am steep,
An' when you hear the horn its a gwine to make you weep,

Come join in de army 'fore dey close de door,
Ob de big white house on de todder shore,
You'll nebber get a chance like dis no more,

Dis world am too full ob sinful things,
Come go over dar whar de angel sings,
You'd better git ready for to put on wings,

Kase he gwine to call you early in de mornin'.
