1. Roaring through the forests,
Gliding through the vale,
Slipping through the tunnels
Flying o'er the rail;
Train behind her dancing
All along the line,
While you hear the whistle
Of the "Twenty nine."

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Clear the track, the bell is ringing,
Hear she comes "on time."
Thatcher Perkins is the builder
Of the "Twenty nine."

2.
She's a thing of beauty,
Flying o'er the road,
Belching forth her power
With her precious load;
Easy in her motion,
Perfect in design,
She is proud of Perkins
He of "Twenty nine."

3.
Hark! I hear her coming,
Through the silent night,
Don't you hear the whistle?
Oh! there is the light;
Her she comes--she's flying
With the train behind,
Look our ev'rybody!
Here comes "Twenty nine."
