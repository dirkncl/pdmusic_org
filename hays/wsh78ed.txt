To Miss Laura Leonard, Oswego, NY
"Eily Darling" (1878)
Words and Music by
William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Eily darling, don't be blushing,
For your face is young and fair,
And your cheeks are like the roses
Hiding in your dark brown hair;
Let your eyes, in beauty beaming,
Look in mine so soft and sweet---
Is my heart just like that rose is,
Which you crush beneath your feet?

CHORUS
Eily darling, don't be bashful,
I can see it in your eye,
Don't you love me? why so modest?
Kiss me for your fond reply.

2.
Eily darling, hear the singing
Of the birds in ev'ry tree,
Would you rather hear their music
Than to listen, love, to me?
Are your dead to all I'm saying?
Does another fill my place
In your heart and its affections?
Eily, look me in the face.

(CHORUS)

3.
Eily darling, I am waiting,
Nature now has gone to sleep,
One fond kiss would make me happy,
And your silence makes me weep;
Tell me, is it tears or blisses?
Come into my soft embrace,
While I smother you with kisses---
Eily, 'tis the time and place.

(CHORUS)
