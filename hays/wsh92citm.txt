WILL S. HAYS						July 13, 1892
	Dear Sir––I received a copy of the song you have
written--to be used, as you say, for an “inspiration” [?]
during the approaching campaign.  I believe, with you,
that the performer of songs and music of the right well
ought not to be unrelated as important adjuncts to a
political campaign; and, so far as I am able to judge,
this latest production of yours may serve a good purpose
in that direction.  One thing I am certain–-the composition
od this song by you is a sure demonstation that the composer
is infected by the sort of spirit and inspiration which wins
elections.
					Very truly yours,
								GROVER CLEVELAND

1.
Come rally round the good old flag,
And give them loud huzzas,
Let ev'ry man do what he can
To help our noble cause,
For Cleveland and for Stevenson
We'll battle ev'ry storm.
And pass the cry along the line
For Revenue Reform.

CHORUS [repeat twice after each verse]
Shout, boys! shout!
Our cause is bound to win,
We'll vote for "Cleve" and stick to "Steve,"
and see that they get in.

2.
For honest Government we'll fight,
For all that's true and fair,
And Grandpa's hat will get mashed flat
When Grover takes the chair;
He ran this grand old Country once,
As President did reign,
As Democrats let's put him back
To run it once again.

3.
Let Democrats throughout the land,
For gallant Cleveland shout,
From ev'ry throat and cast his vote
And man to man, turn out,
Let's win our cause, the world's applause,
And do all that we can,
Work day and night wit hall our might
For Cleveland is the man.
