1.
Shadows of evening now gather,
Nature seems seeking a rest
Around the bright fireside sitting
Are those I love dearest and best.
My little one come let me love you
Come fill my heart with delight
Kiss me good-night little darling,
Come kiss your papa good-night.

CHORUS
Kneel at the feet of your mother,
O! what a beautiful sight, (Little darling, go)
Kiss her good night little darling,
Then kiss your papa good-night (good-night).

2.
O! may you life be a pleasure,
Bright as your childhood would seem
Your pathway be one of bright flowers,
And each sleep bring some beautiful dream.
Come sit on my knee I love you
Let me look in your blue eye so bright,
The kiss me good-night little darling,
Come kiss your papa good-night.

(CHORUS)

3.
Go put your arms around your mother,
Put on her lips a sweet kiss,
Tell her you love her my darling,
Fill her fond heart with pure bliss
I'll then lay you down on your pillow
Like a sweet little angel in white
I'll kiss you to sleep little darling,
So come kiss your papa good-night.

(CHORUS)
