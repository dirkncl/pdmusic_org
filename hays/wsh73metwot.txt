1. Deep in the night I lonely sat,
And I watch’d the palefaced moon,
And I heard the songters of the grove
Chanting a merry tune.
My mind’s eye smil’d on the dreamy past,
And it wandered o’er life’s sea,
’Till my life was lost in the happy thought,
Of thee— only thee.

CHORUS 1-3.
But not of smiles from other eyes,
Nor faces fair to see,
For beautiful one, my ev’ry  thought,
Was of thee— only thee.

2. I saw the beautiful orbs of night,
Look down from the azure skies;
And ev’ry time that I smiled on them,
They seemed as thy lovely eyes.
’Twas not of the worldly ones I thought,
But a purer bliss to me,
When I let my faith like a swift bird fly
To thee— only thee.

3. I bade farewell to the passing  moon,
And the twinking stars so bright,
And I said “Adieu” to the troubled world,
But to thee, “Sweet dreams, good night.”
And when slumber soft mine eyelids closed,
Oh! I wish’d that my life could be
As pure and sweet as the dreams I had
Of thee— on;ly thee.
