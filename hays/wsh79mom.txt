1.
Maid of Miami, I love you,
Why hang your beautiful face?
Let your bright eyes smile upon me,
Give me one loving embrace.
Tell me, my darling, you love me,
Promise that you will be true;
My heart, with its fondest devotion,
Sighs, and sighs only for you.

CHORUS
Sweet Maid of Miami, I love you,
Give my one kiss ere we part,
A smile for a smile, and a kiss for a kiss,
And then give a heart for a heart.

2.
Maid of Miami, I love you,
Have 'neath the bright starlit skies,
Love, let me swear that I love you,
Swear by your beautiful eyes.
Why are you silently blushing?
Why the rose-tint on your cheek?
Look in my eyes while I'm pleasing,
Say if you love me, oh, speak.

(CHORUS)

3.
Maid of Miami, I love you,
Why will you sadden my heart?
Say, love, you love me and kiss me,
Kiss me goodnight ere we part.
See how the bright stars are laughing,
Look up, and smile in their light;
Come to my arms, my own darling,
Kiss me, and tell me "goodnight."

(CHORUS)
