1. Yes, we think of thee at home,
  Yes, we ever think of thee'
Thou hast shared our ev’ry grief,
  And hast mingled in our glee.
Yes, our love is just as warm
  As when thou did’st start to roam,
Then why dost ask, our dearest one,
  If we think of thee at home!
Then why dost ask, our dearest one,
  If we think of thee at home!

2. Yes, we think of thee at eve,
  And the songs thou did’st then sing;
But thy harp is silent now,
  For no hand has touched its string.
We forgive thee and forget,
  While our lips all murmur “come!”
For ’tis years since we have met,
  Still we think of thee at home.
For ’tis years since we have met,
  Still we think of thee at home.

3. Yes, we know of thy deep love,
  In thy girlhood’s sunny days;
And we often think of him
  Who has crown’d thy life with praise
Since thou’rt happy by his side,
  Mays’t thou thus forever roam,
While we fondly think of thee,
  Yes! still think of thee at home,
While we fondly think of thee,
  Yes! still think of thee at home.
