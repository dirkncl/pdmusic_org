1.
The evening shadows gather'd,
And the sun had gone to rest,
The nightengale was singing
To the cuckoo in its nest.
The moon in all its beauty
Like a monarch leaped the sky
When I left my home in Erin,
And I kissed the all "goodbye."

CHORUS
Oh! I long to see the loved ones,
And I think of them and sigh,
To see my home in Erin,
And the ones I kissed "goodbye."

2.
I care not where I wander,
I can see my mother's face,
And my poor old grayhaired father
As I go from place to place.
I can see them as we parted
With a teardrop in each eye
When I left my home in Erin,
And I kissed the all "goodbye."

(CHORUS)

3.
It is years since last we parted,
And I crossed the deep blue sea,
And I often, often wander
If they have forgotten me.
I would give the world to see them
Once again before they die,
At my dear old home in Erin,
And I kissed the all "goodbye."

(CHORUS)
