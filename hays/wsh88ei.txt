1. Almighty God! Thou King of Kings,
  Teach us to know Thy righteous ways,
We meet to listen to Thy Word—
  To pray, and sing Thy songs of praise,
O! Lord, forgive our sinful souls,
  And send Thy blessings from above,
In loving mercy hear our pray’rs,
  And bless us with Thy holy love.

CHORUS 1-2.
O! may our sinful souls prepare
  To enter Heaven,
To join the host Who honor, worship, love and praise,
  Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

2. Almighty God! O! let Thy  love,
  So pure, so holy and divine,
Be as a light to guide lost souls
  Into this sacred house of Thine.
May words we hear and songs we sing,
  And earnest pray’rs turn souls from sin,
That Thou mays’t say on Judgment day,
  To all who loved Thee, “Enter in.”
