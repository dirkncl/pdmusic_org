1.
  I stole to the bowers,
  Amid the wild flowers,
One beautiful evening in June;
  The stars, in their beauty,
  Seem'd doing their duty
By winking so sly at the moon,
  As it mounted the sky,
  And pass'd them all by
In its gorgeous and lovely array;
  But how little they knew,
  I was waiting for you,
My beautiful Marian Gray.

CHORUS
Marian Gray,
Sadly I weep,
For death stole my lov'd one away,
And the angels rejoice
When they hear the sweet voice
Of my beautiful Marian Gray.

2.
  The birds hushed their song,
  For they though it was wrong
To sing, when they very well knew
  That no music so sweet
  With thy voice could compete
When I sat, love, and listened to you.
  And your eyes were so bright,
  When they smiled with delight,
And you said that you loved--and who, pray?
  Ah, the answer was this--
  Not in words--'twas a kiss,
From the lips of sweet Marian Gray.

(CHORUS)

3.
  But alas! she is gone!
  I am sad and alone,
For Death stole my loved one away,
  And the angels rejoice
  When they hear the sweet voice
Of my beautiful Marian Gray.
  Now calmly she sleeps
  'Neath the willow that weeps,
By the murmuring stream in its play,
  That ripples along
  As it murmurs a song
Near the grave of sweet Marian Gray.

(CHORUS)
