1.
Her face is beautiful and fair,
Her heart is kind and true,
The bloom of youth is on her cheek,
Her eyes are bright and blue;
The first time that we ever met
I gave my heart away,
And ever since, I've fondly loved
My pretty Minnie May.

CHORUS
She loves me, for she told me so,
I love her night and day,
A sweeter lassie never lived
Than pretty Minnie May.

2.
I met her where the roses bloom,
Down by the meadow spring,
And when I told her of my love,
The merry birds did sing,
She kissed me, blushed, and held my hand,
But not a word did say,
For well she knew that she loved me,
And I loved Minnie May.

(CHORUS)
