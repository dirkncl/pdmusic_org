1.
I've wandered since my childhood days,
Alone o'er life's dark sea;
No waves of pleasure ever rolls
Across its path for me.
My lonely bark has always braved
The stormy billows foam;
Till in my heart I sigh, and say,
"I wish I had a home."

CHORUS
A home, (A happy home,) a happy home, (a happy home,)
Where pleas- (Where pleasres) -ures always come;
O! what is life to one like me?
I which I had a home.

2.
I love the streams, the fields and flowers,
All nature's fair to see;
I love to hear the songs of birds,
But what are all to me?
Mid scenes of joy and pleasures sweet,
No matter where I roam;
There is that longing in my heart,
"I wish I had a home."

(CHORUS)

3.
My lone heart in its sadness grieves
And yearns for peace and joy,
Which I have never, never known,
Since I left home, a boy.
And as I journey to my grave,
I'll wait till death shall come,
Then say to angels, "pity me,"
"I wish I had a home."

(CHORUS)
