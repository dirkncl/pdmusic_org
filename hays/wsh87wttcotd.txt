1. Mother, dear Mother, Oh, don’t look so sad,
Wipe the warm tears from your cheek,
Tell me, Oh, tell me,— can’t I make you glad?
Why don’t you look up and speak?
Why do you sigh like your poor heart would break?
Tell me, I beg and implore,
Look up and speak to your own darling boy,
Who tied that crape on the door?
Oh, who tied that crape on the door?

CHORUS 1-2.
Who tied that crape on the door?
Oh, who tied that crape on the door?
Look up, ask God, and the angels will say
Death tied that crape on the door.
[door, on the door.]

2. Come here, my boy, let me look in your face,
Then bow your dear little head,
Let me then fold you close in my embrace,
There lies your poor papa dead.
Look up and tell me you’ll always love me,
Answer, I’ll ask you no more,
Papa has left us, for God called him home,
Death tied that crape on the floor.
Oh, death tied that crape on the door.
