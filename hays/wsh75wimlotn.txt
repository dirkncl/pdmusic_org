1.
Sitting alone in the door
Looking far out on the sea,
Thinking of some one I love,
Dearer than life is to me;
Softly the bright-beaming stars,
Shedding their pale, mellow light,---
Sadly I look up and sigh---
Where is my loved one to-night?

CHORUS
Sitting alone, all alone,
O! tell me, why don't he write?
How my poor heart longs to know:
Where is my loved one to-night?

2.
While I look out on the sea,
Silver'd by yonder bright moon,
Wavelets come back to the shore
Bringing to me a sad tune;
Birds of the sea and the shore
Play o'er the deep in delight,
Yet, amid all, my heart asks---
Where is my loved one to-night?

(CHORUS)

3.
How my lone heart loves to keep
All that is lock'd in it there,
How my lips ev'ry night breathe
Loving his name in each prayer;
O! how I'll tremble with joy
When the good ship comes in sight,
Bringing my loved one me---
God bless you, darling to-night.

(CHORUS)
