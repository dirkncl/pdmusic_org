1.
Gude by Jamie, take my blessin',
God be wi' ye and the sea,
When ye've crossed the stormy ocean,
Send a letter hame to me.
Say ye'll keep outside the taver,
An 'twill fill my heart wi' glee,
Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
Dinna forget to think o' me,
  Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
  Dinna forget to think o' me.

2.
When ye're far awa' an' lonely,
Folks will ask fro' whence ye cam,
Dinna forget yer poor auld mither,
Wham ye've left alane at hame.
When ye lift yer e'es to Heaven,
An' ye pray on bended knee,
Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
Dinna forget to think o' me,
  Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
  Dinna forget to think o' me.

3.
Take the Gude Book which I gi'e ye,
In will guide ye ev'rywhere,
When ye're sick, or when ye're troubled,
You can find sweet comfort there.
It will keep you from temptation
When the winecup sparkles high.
Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
Let me kiss ye sweet gude bye.
  Dinna forget yer promise, Jamie,
  Let me kiss ye sweet gude bye.
