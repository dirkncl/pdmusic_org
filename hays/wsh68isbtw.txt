1.
I'm sitting by the window, love,
'Tis sweet bewitching night;
And tear drops tremble on my cheeks,
As mem'ry takes its flight.
The twinkling stars smile at the moon,
They've nothing else to do,
The night owl sings his doleful tune,
While I think, love, of you.

CHORUS
O whisper to my poor sad heart,
While I to Heaven bow,
And tell me where my loved one is,
Where is my husband now?

2.
The little ones have gone to sleep,
They knelt down at my knee;
All looked to Heav'n and in their prayers
Remembered you and me.
I kissed each one a sweet goodnight,
God bless and keep them true;
I turned away with tearful eyes,
To think, dear one, of you.

(CHORUS)

3.
On land or sea, where'er you are,
O let your heart be light,
And hasten home for God, I know;
Has heard my prayer tonight.
He'll guide your footsteps night and day,
Where'er in life you roam;
And safely bring you back again,
To children, wife, and home.

(CHORUS)
