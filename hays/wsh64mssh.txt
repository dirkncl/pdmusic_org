1.
Oh! mother, dear, I have come home,
The home I loved so true,
But I'm unhappy, all is changed,
Yet there's no change in you.
Each flower lifts its blushing face,
The birds are glad I've come,
But nature seems to weep around,
My Southern sunny home.

CHORUS
My home! (My sunny home!) my home!(my sunny home!)
My Southern sunny, sunny home!
Dear mother, I've come home to die,
In my Southern sunny, sunny home.

2.
It seems a few short years ago,
Oh! we were happy then,
But, mother, dear, Oh! Weep not now,
For we'll be glad again.
There is a place in yonder skies
Where angels love to roam.
Where you and I are sure to find
A brighter sunny home.

(CHORUS)
