1.
I vas, if you know it, a Madison Pelle,
Whom gaptivate vonce a feller vot swell,
He vas glerk off a bootcher, und sell his meats rare;
He was such a nice man from the close he don't vear,
Vas ouf Saratoga ben a year coom mit Yune,
Ve talk und ve talk of te shine of ter moon,
He squeeze me mine hand, und he make me a kiss,
I feel me so goot, ven I feel me like dis.

CHORUS
Up in das Palloon, Boys,
Up in das Palloon,
Out among dem leedle shtars,

Up in das Palloon, Boys,
Up in das Palloon,

I ride in das Palloon.

Und some lager und pretzels from Tiffany's brought,
But shopst ven ze bill to mine young feller vent

But ven mine old Daddy speak, "Say, mine friend, vere

Und dat man he vas kick him to death mit a cow,
Und der cow, dat got crazy, now aint worth a smoke,

He preak me to pieces mine Sowin' Marshevn.
