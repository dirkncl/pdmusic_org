1.
Now the moon is shining brightly
And the little stars, in pride
Seem to watch us very closely,
While you're sitting by my side;
But you need not hide your blushes,
For they can't hear what we say,
O Bessie, will you love me,
When I am far away?

CHORUS
Look up, my darling,--tell me,
Will love like ours decay?
O Bessie, will you love me
When I am far away?

2.
While the nightingale is singing
To its loving mate so true,
Let me sit beside you, Bessie,
While I tell my love to you!
For you know I love you only,
You're my angel, night and day,
O Bessie, will you love me,
When I am far away?

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh, ... Bessie, don't be sighing,
For I know 'tis sad to part,
And a kiss would make me happy,
While your tears will break my heart;
Now good bye, and let me ask you,
To remember, when you pray,
That you'll not forget me, Bessie,
When I am far away?

(CHORUS)
