[Written and composed by]
William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
I went to see my Susan;
She met me at the door,
And told me that I needn't come
To see her any more;
She fell in love with Rufus Andrew Jackson Paine,
I looked her in the face and said, "Goodbye, Susan Jane."

CHORUS
Oh! Susan Jane!
Oh! Susan Jane!
Oh! Susan, quit your foolin',
And give my heart to me,
Oh, give me back my love again,
And I will let you be;
I used to love you dearly,
I cannot love again;
I'm going away to leave you soon,
Goodbye, Susan Jane.

2.
Her mouth was like a cellar,
Her foot was like a ham,
Her eyes were like an owl's at night,
Her voice was never calm;
Her hair was long and curly,
She looked just like a crane,
I've bid farewell to all my love,
"Goodbye, Susan Jane."

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh, Susan's so deceiving,
She will not do to trust;
I've threaten'd once to leave her,
And leave her now I must;
I'll never love another,
To cause me any pain;
I've trusted her, and all the girls
Are just like Susan Jane.

(CHORUS)
