"Good Bye! I'm Gone" (1881)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
O! Hannah don't you grieve for me.
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
I'm gwine down to Tennessee,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
I come to tell you all goodbye,
I'se gwine to you till I die,
Den wipe dat teardrop from your eye,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!

CHORUS
Den good bye Hannah, good bye dear,
I'll be back home this time next year,
Now see how good dat you can bem
And don't forget to write to me,
  Good Bye, I'm gone.

2.
O! send dem chil'ren off to school,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
And teach to dem dat Golden rule,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
And if I dies we sure to meet,
Each other on that silver street,
Wid golden slippers on dem feet,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!

(CHORUS)

3.
Den I must go I cannot wait,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
I'll meet you at de Golden Gate,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!
Ef you get dar afore I do,
Tell dem Good Angels let you through,
An' wait for me I'm Comin' too,
  Good Bye! I'm gone!

(CHORUS)
