1. I am dying, Mother, dying,
  Far away from home and thee,
Oh! if thou wert near me sighing,
  What a happ death ’twould be.
Stranger eyes are sadly weeping,
  As they gaze upon my bed
For they know I’ll soon be sleeping
  In the household of the dead.

CHORUS 1-3.
Mother, do not weep for me,
  Do not weep,
Soon the struggle will be o’er, will be o’er,
I am dying, mother, dying,
We shall meet on earth no more, no more.

2. I am dying, mother, dying,
  Yet I dadly think of thee,
Come, whoevee I am lying,
  Weep a mother’s tear for me.
How I loved thee as no other,
  Time alas! can never tell;
Yet ’tis hard, my dearest mother,
  Dying, I must say “farewell!”

3. I am dying, mother, dying,
  Death’s cold hand is on my brow,
Stangers linger near me sighing,
  Oh! I feel I’m sinking now.
Thou will tell thee  how I miss thee,
  They will fill thy heart with joy,
They will meet thee, they will kiss thee,
  Kiss thee for thy absent boy.
