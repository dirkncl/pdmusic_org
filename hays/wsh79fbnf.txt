1.
My own true love, my heart is sad,
It nearly breaks to grieve you,
I would not add one pang of grief
To yours, but I must leave you.
These sad, sad tears alone can tell
How hard it is to sever,
But we will one day meet again--
Farewell, but not forever.

CHORUS
Goodbye (My own sweet love,) goodbye,
'Twill be my fond endeavor,
To let my heart be true to you,
Farewell, but not forever.

2.
When shadows cloud the face of day,
And stars will smile above you,
Oh! think of me, though far away,
How fondly still I love you.
Be happy in the one sweet thought,
That I'll forget you never,
Of one who kissed you when he said--
"Farewell, but not forever."

(CHORUS)

3.
I care not when or where I roam,
My poor heart will be lonely
Until I bring it back to you,
For I love you-- you only.
One kiss, then let us promise, love,
If I should cross death's river,
We'll try and meet again "up there,"
Farewell, but not forever.

(CHORUS)
