1.
The morning wakes with cheerful smile,
And nature is a-glee.
The birds play hide and seek in joy,
And flowers gem the lea.
And cheerful voices echo o'er
The lake from shore to shore,
And boats glide on it bearing hearts
To love's bewitching door.

CHORUS
Flirting on the lake,
Flirting on the lake,
We beat the world for pretty girls,
And flirting on the lake.
Flirting on the lake,
Flirting on the lake,
We beat the world for pretty girls,
And flirting on the lake.

2.
The summer sun shines on the lake,
As if it knew 'twas noon,
And balmy breezes scent the air
With chorus sweet in tune.
As white sails flit across the lakes,
And hearts are merry made,
Until they find a cosey nook
For resting in the shade.

(CHORUS)

3.
The moon and stars smile on Lake View,
The day of pleasure's spent,
And love invites the boys and girls
To fly away from Kent.
It is no place for pretty girls,
To sweet confession make,
The proper place to flirt with beaux
Is out upon the lake.

(CHORUS)

4.
The evening shadows gather now,
And sweet bewitching night
Calls out the moon and little stars,
That they may see the light.
How Kent House girls put on their hats,
And beaux their captives make,
While they, God bless their pretty souls,
Are flirting on the lake.

(CHORUS)
