1. Oh! I often think of childhood,
  And of my dear old home;
But nothing’s half so dear in life to me,
  As the dear old distant wild wood,
Where oft I used to roam;
  With bonnie black eyed beauty Annie Lee.

CHORUS 1-4.
Annie Lee, Oh! Anne Lee,
  Do not weep for me;
For this cruel war is over,
  I’ll soon be home again
To live and love my pretty Annie Lee.

2. I remember when we parted,
  I left her to the dorr;
The tears that fill’d her eyes I wept to see,
  And I kiss’s her e’re I started
Perhaps I never more
  Would see my black eyed beauty Annie Lee.

3. Oh! I long to see my Annie,
  The girl I love so true,
I know she’s waiting now at home for me,
  And my sorrows have been many,
My pleasures have been few
  Away from black eyed beauty Annie Lee.

4. Oh! my heart is free from sorrow,
  My life will be a bliss,
Oh! what a happy girl I know she’ll be;
  For I’m going home tomorrow,
And meet her with a kiss,
  To never part again with Anne Lee.
