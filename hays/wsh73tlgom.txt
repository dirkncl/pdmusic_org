1.
How sad tonight my troubled heart,
How dim mine eyes with tears!
For Death has robb'd me of the joy
I thought was mine for years.
The sunbeams of my happy life
Will never on me shine
Until in Heaven I will meet
That little girl of mine!

CHORUS
Sweet Angels, let thy loving smiles
Upon my pathway shine,
To lead me where I'll meet again,
That darling little girl of mine.

2.
The very light and life of home,
That came, I thought, to stay;
To make my happy while I lived,
Too soon was call'd away.
The eyes that smiled so sweet on me,
The form I thought divine,
All, all is gone, for Heaven claimed
That darling girl of mine!

(CHORUS)

3.
My life is lonesome, home is sad,
My heart is filled with pain;
I feel like one who'll never know
A joy in life again.
Whenever I see a child's blue eyes
In beauty on my shine,
My poor heart bleeds oh, then I miss
That darling girl of mine!

(CHORUS)
