1.
Years have past since last we parted,
At the cottage door,
When I left her broken hearted
On a distant shore;
But I've written her a letter,
Far across the sea:
Mary's waiting at the window,
Waiting there for me.

CHORUS
Smile upon her stars of heaven,
As I look to thee,
Thinking of my home--my Mary
Waiting, waiting there for me.

CHORUS, as lib. (with overlapped voices)
SOPRANO
Smile upon her stars of heaven,
As I look to thee,
Thinking of my home--my Mary
Waiting, waiting there for me.
ALTO, TENOR, BASS
Mary's waiting, at the window,
looking, watching, looking, watching for me,
Mary's watching, Mary's watching,
Mary's waiting there for me.

2.
Gently smile the stars above me,
Through the veil of night,
While the thought that Mary loves me
Fills me with delight,
As I long to see her, kiss her,--
Happy would I be--
Mary's waiting at the window,
Waiting there for me.

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS, ad lib.)

3.
I am sad tonight, and lonely,
Far from her I roam,
Yet my heart clings to her only
And my happy home.
I am going, bear me onward
O'er the deep blue sea,--
Mary's waiting at the window,,
Waiting there for me.

(CHORUS)
(CHORUS, ad lib.)
