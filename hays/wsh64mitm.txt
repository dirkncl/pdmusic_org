1.
The cru-el war must have an end;
I'll tell you what we'll do;
We'll cast our votes for "Lit-tle Mac,"
We're bound to put him through.
The wid-ow's wails and or-phan's tears.
Pre-vail-ing o'er the land.
Pray heaven to send a rare re-lief--
Mc-Clel-lan is the man.

CHORUS
Shout! boys, shout!
  and ral-ly all you can,
We'll have an-oth-er Wash-ing-ton--
  Mc-Clel-lan is the man!

2.
Cor-rup-tion sits in plac-es high,
  And Shod-dy rules the roast;
"Fight on!" is still Cor-rup-tion's cry,
  "More spoils!" is Shod-dy's boast.
But we, the peo-ple, sov'reigns all,
  De-clare our right-eous cause;
"The Con-sti-tu-tion as it is,
  The U-nion as it was."

(CHORUS)

3.
This cru-el war will nev-er cease
  Un-til the South comes back;
The on-ly man to do the work
  Is glor-ious "Lit-tle Mac."
Then let us put him in the chair,
  And he will give us peace;
For "Peace in U-nion" is his sin,
  And war's a-larms will cease.
 
(CHORUS)

4.
Let's heal dis-sen-tions and u-nite,
  Then, strong-er than be-fore,
We'll bear our ban-ner through the world,
  The flag our fa-thers bore.
In man-y stripes and gol-den stars
  Shall give the peo-ple ease;
And all th's-pressed of ev-ery clime
  Will hail our happy peace.

(CHORUS)

5.
The hot-heads South cried "Let's secede,"
  But find it doesn't pay;
The hot-heads North cried "Confiscate,
  And then we'll have our way."
But both have failed and always will;
  There is a better plan:
We'll choose a right-eous Pres-i-dent--
  Mc-Clel-lan is the man!

(CHORUS)
