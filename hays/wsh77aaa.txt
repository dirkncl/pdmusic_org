1.
I sit in the door of my dear little home,
And look far away o'er the sea,
And tears fill my eyes as I look for the ship,
That is bringing my darling to me;
The darkness of night forms a vail o'er its brest,
All home of his coming has flown,
I turn to my pillow and lie down to weep,
For he knows I'm alone, all alone.

CHORUS
Alone, all alone, in my own humble home,
That stands by itself near the sea (all alone).
And I pray on tomorrow the good ship will come,
That will bring back my darling to me.

2.
The days seem as years since we parted that morn,
He kissed me, and said he would write,
And I'll never forget, how I wept as I watched,
The ship as she sailed out of sight;
But I loved him, and thought of him, prayed for him too,
Each hour of each day he's been gone,
And I feel in my heart that he's longing for home,
For he knows I'm alone, all alone.

(CHORUS)

3.
My heart has been with him, and his is with me,
We've lived for each other for years,
I go back and look---I will watch for a sail---
Till my eyes become blinded with tears;
I will list to the song of the murmering sea,
And think 'tis a song of my own.
O ship hasten back, bring my darling to me,
For he knows I'm alone, all alone.

(CHORUS)
