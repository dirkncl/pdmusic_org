"Angels Meet Me at the Cross Roads" (1875)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Come down, Gabriel, blow your horn,
Call me home in de early morn;
Send de chariot down dis way,
Come and haul me home to stay. O!

CHORUS
Angels meet me at de Cross roads, meet me,
Angels meet me at de Cross roads, meet me,
Angels meet me at de Cross roads, meet me,
Don't charge a sinner any toll.

2.
I'se libed for months, an I'se libed for years,
Can't get used to my weepin' tears;
Lost my way on de road in sin,
Wake up, angels, pass me in. O!

(CHORUS)

3.
Plant my foot on de golden rocks,
Put my money in de mission box;
When I git dar, an you hear me call,
Come on, dem, for dar's room for all. O!

(CHORUS)

4.
Stand back, sinners, let me pass;
I see de lane to house at last;
Come an' jine wid de angel band,
We'll all git home to de happy land. O!

(CHORUS)

5.
Dem angels ain't got long to wait;
Dey's standing now at de golden gate,
When we git dar, on de toder shore,
Dey'll go inside, and dey'll shut the door. O!

(CHORUS)
