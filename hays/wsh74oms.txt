1.
Jay birds singin' in de garden,
Dog bark at de moon;
Darkey's dancin' in de cabin,
Possum fool de coon.
Han' me down de good ole banjo,
Aint got long to stay,
Play and sing awhile for Susie,
Kase I'm gwine away.

CHORUS
[Solo]
O! Miss Susie,
[Chorus]
gwine to leave you,
[Solo]
O! Miss Susie,
[Chorus]
don't you cry;
[Solo]
O! Miss Susie,
[Chorus]
come an' kiss me,
Wipe de teardrop
from your eye.

2.
Now I hear de steamboat comin'
Down below de bend;
Send my love back in a letter,
All I got to send.
All de little stars am shinin',
Jest as bright as day,
Come set down beside me, Susie,
Kase I'm gwine away.

(CHORUS)

3.
Put dis ring upon your finger,
Den gib me a kiss;
Go and see your good ole master,
Den go see ole miss'.
Tell dem I am gwine to leave you.
See what dey will say,
Tell dem if dey'll give you to me,
Susie, dear, I'll stay.

(CHORUS)
