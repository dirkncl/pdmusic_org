1.
I see Mistress Jinks of Madison Square,
I wear fine clothes and I puff my hair,
And how the gentlemen at me stare,
While my husband's in the army.
Where-e'er I go, I'm talked about 
I'm talked about I'm talked about
I wear the latest English fashions out,
While the Captain's in the army.

SPOKEN
And why shouldn't I?
Every body [? ? ? ?]:--

[SUNG]
I am Misteress Jinks of Madison Square,
I wear fine clothes and I puff my hair,
And how the gentlemen at my stare,
While the Captain's in the army.

2.
I give my parties and my balls,
And 'tend to all my evening calls,
And buy the best I can find at Hall's,
While my husband's in the army.
I'll write to him and he writes to me,
He write, to me, he writes to me,
And says that I must happy be,
While the Captain's in the army.

SPOKEN
And why shouldn't I?
If he fights for his pay, I get it, and spend it.
He's happy so am I, for:--

[SUNG]
I am Misteress Jinks of Madison Square,
I wear fine clothes and I puff my hair,
And how the gentlemen at my stare,
While the Captain's in the army.

3.
He says he'll get a furlough soon,
And come back home to stay till June,
O! wont I sing a different tune,
To my husband in the army.
I'll meet him then with kisses sweet,
With kisses sweet, with kisses sweet,
I'll hasten out of the door to meet
With the Captain home from the army.

SPOKEN
And why shouldn't I?
Hav'nt I spent all his money?
Our large bills, became past due, nothing to wear,
hungry, and,--well

[SUNG]
I am Misteress Jinks of Madison Square,
My clothes are bad I have nothing to wear,
The Captain got on an awful "tear,"
And they kicked him out of the army.
