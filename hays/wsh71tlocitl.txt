"The Little Old Cabin in the Lane" (1871)
As Sung by Manning's Minstrels.
Words & Music by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
I'm getting old and feeble now,
I cannot work no more,
I've laid de rusty bladed hoe to rest,
Ole massa an' ole miss's am dead,
dey're sleepin' side by side,
Deir spirits now are roaming wid de blest;
De scene am changed about de place,
de darkies are all gone,
I'll neber hear dem singin in the cane,
And I'se de only one dat's left
wid dis ole dog ob mine,
In de little old log cabin in de lane.

CHORUS
De chimney's falling down, and de roof is cavin' in,
I aint got long round her to remain,
But de angels watches over me when I lays down to sleep,
In de little old log cabin in de lane.

2.
Dar was a happy time to me,
'twas many years ago,
When de darkies used to gather round de door,
When dey used to dance an' sing at night,
I played de ole banjo,
But alas, I cannot play it anymore.
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down,
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain,
An' de only friend I've got now is dis good ole dog ob mine,
In de little old log cabin in de lane.

(CHORUS)

3.
De footpath now is coverd o'er
dat led us round de hill,
And de fences all are going to decay,
An' de creek is all dried up
where we used to go to mill,
De time has turned its course an-od-der way.
But I aint got long to stay here, and what little time I got,
I'll try and be content-ed to remain
Till death shall call my dog an' me to find a better home
Dan dat little old log cabin in de lane.

(CHORUS)
