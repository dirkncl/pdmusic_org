1. Moving along in the moonlight,
  Picture of grace and pride;
Ponderous wheels in motion,
  Waves on the silvery tide.
Smoke flows from the chimneys rolling,
  Tinged by the clouds of steam;
Graceful and gently gliding
  Swiftly adown the stream;
The twinkling stars are smiling
  Down from the moonlit sky.
Birds on the banks are singing,
  Watching the boat go by,
Ah! Never so lovely a picture,
  Nothing on earth can mar
As the  sight of the graceful steamer,
  The beautiful Guiding Star.

CHORUS 1-2 [sung twice after each VERSE]
The beautiful Guiding Star,
  The popular Guiding Star,
There isn’t a boat on the river afloat,
  As fine as the Guiding Star.

2. Cabin a scene of beauty,
  One of the gerandest sights,
Music and song and dancing,
  Brilliant electric lights,
Hegler on board commanding,
  Safely she rides the stream;
Life to her passenger’s pleasure,
  Sweet as a passing dream;
Day time or night when she’s running,
  Ever unfolding scenes
Going to Cincinnati,
  Or gliding to New Orleans.
Ah! She is “one of the finest,”
  One of the best by far
For speed, for comfort or safety
  The beautiful Guiding Star.
