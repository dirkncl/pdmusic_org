1. How the bright little stars shine upon me,
And the moon trolls so gently along;
Now the birds have all done with their singing,
The night bird alone sings his song,
My young heart now opens its windows,
How happy indeed it must be,
For ’tis filled with the light of thy friendship,
Tonight I was thinking of thee.

CHORUS 1-3.
Thinking of thee, still thinking of thee,
Lov’d one, I know thou must be,
Happy in feeding and knowing,
Tonight I am thinking of thee, of thee.

2. O, I think of the hour we parted,
And remember the last fond “Good bye,”
And the last tender kiss of affection,
And the tear drop that shone in thine eye,
No, no, I can never forget it,
The last sweet smile that you gave me,
When you whisper’d “Goodbye and God bless you;”
Tonight, I am thinking of thee.

3. Oh, ’tis many long years since we parted,
And it may not be long  ere we meet,
Yet the thought, we are true to each other,
Is one that is pleasant and sweet,
Soon, soon will we welcome each other,
Till then, oh how lonely I’ll be,
And believe me, my own dear belov’c one,
Tonight I am thinking of thee.
