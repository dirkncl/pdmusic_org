To the Ladies of the South
"The Gelsemine Vine" (1879)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

The Gelsimine, or yellow jessamine (the gelseminum officinal), may well be
called the prince of the grand old forests of the South.  It climbs to the
 tops of the tallest pines, and sends off its streamers and festoons, of
      bright golden bells, whose fragrance and beauty are simply en-
      chanting.  There is an old superstition in the South that all
       love that is plighted beneath this vine will be prosperous
            and happy, and the lovers be true to each other.
            Hence the vine is a great favorite in the Atlan-
               tic and Gulf States, and is held in roman-
                 tic reverence by all classes. -- (New

1.
The dream is sweet that this loved vine,
Of which I sing to thee,
The God of Love his emblem made,
For high and low degree,
That all who madly love and woo
In eve-ning's mellow time,
Will both be true if they but swear
Beneath the Gelse-mine vine.

CHORUS
Oh, Lovely Gelse-mine vine!
Bright leaves and golden bells,
How many a tale of love and truth
Thy matchless beauty tells.

2.
All nigh thy fragrant incense floats
As rich as lover's sighs,
And in thy royal golden bells
The sweetest perfume lies.
Thy loving tendrils fondly cling
About the sturdy pine,
And so do arms of those who love
Around each other twine.

(CHORUS)

3.
Beneath this loved and hallowed vine,
No doubt, no fears arise,
No aching hearts are ever known,
Nor grief, nor weeping eyes.
For troth once fondly plighted there,
Where love birds building nest,
Will ever true and faithful prove,
Will ever constant rest.

(CHORUS)

4.
And Southern maidens fair still list
To love tales whispered there,
And gallant Southern lovers trust
Their blushing "Ladyes faire";
And still the bright, glad stars do shine,
Still bloom the golden bells,
Still hearts grow true beneath this vine,
Just as tradition tells.

(CHORUS)
