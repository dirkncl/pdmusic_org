A Beautiful Song & Chorus.
Song for Mezzo Soprano with Chorus (Ad Lib.)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1917

1.
When the curtains of night are plumed back by the stars.
And the beautiful moon leaps the skies
And the dewdrops of heaven are kissing the rose,
It is then that my memory flies,
As if on the wings of some beautiful dove,
In haste with the message it bears
To bring you a kiss of affection and say,
"I remember you, love, in my prayers."

CHORUS
Go where you will--- on land or at sea---
I'll share all your sorrows and cares;
And at night, when I kneel by my bedside and pray,
I'll remember you love in my prayers.

2.
I have loved you too fondly to ever forget
The love you have spoken for me,
And the kiss of affection still warm on my lips
When you told me how true you would be,
I know not if Fortune be fickle or friend
Of if time on your memory wears;
I know that I love you wherever you roam,
And remember you, love, in my prayers.

(CHORUS)

3.
When heavenly angels are guarding the good,
As God has ordain'd them to do,
In answer to prayers I have offered to Him.
I know there is one watching you;
And may its bright spirit be with you through life
To guide you up heaven's bright stairs,
And meet with the one who has loved you so true,
And remember you, love, in her prayers.

(CHORUS)
