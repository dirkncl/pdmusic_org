De white folks say, dis silly fuss: 
Am gittin wuss and bigger, 
An sum folks dey am mad enuff 
To say it am de Niggers, 
An if it am I, can’t help dat, 
De white, folks got de triggers; 
An now becase dare ham’s am full, 
Dey’s down on all de Niggers!

CHORUS
But I can’t help dat!
’Taint my fault;
You kin plainly see,
De more dis war dey prosycute
De wuss it am for me.
