To Miss Sunie P. Mitchell, St. Louis, MO
"Evangeline" (1862)
Song & Chorus
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Sweet Evangeline,
My lost Evangeline,
We have lived and loved, each other fond and true,
Ever true to thee, tho' far away I've been,
My heart has ever dwelt with you,
But O, those happy days will ne'er return,
Those happy days that we have seen;
For I am left to weep alone,
My sweet Evangeline.

CHORUS
Oh! how sad we've been,
Lost Evangeline,
Since we laid thee where the sweetest flowers wave,
(She is gone,)
And the angels bright,
(yes! she is gone,)
Robed in spotless white,
(yes! she is gone,)
Are watching o're thy green and mossy grave.
Evangeline, Evangeline,
Evangeline, Evangeline,
(She's gone,)
To the silent grave.

2.
I am lonely now,
My dear Evangeline,
The days are long, the nights are sad and drear,
And how changed, alas! each well remembered scene,
Since you and I were sitting here,
Alas! you nevermore will smile on me,
And life is now a sad, sad dream,
I lived to love none else but thee,
My sweet Evangeline.

(CHORUS)
