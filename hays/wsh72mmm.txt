1.
Meet me, Maggie, in the springtime,
When the flowers bloom again,
When each songster loves to warble
Some melodious, happy strain.
Meet me when the twilight shadows
Gather round the brow of day,
When the smiling face of Nature
Looks so blooming and so gay.

CHORUS
Meet me, Maggie, gentle Maggie,
I'll be waiting, dear, for you,
Oh, my heart is lonely pining
For your smile so warm and true.

2.
Meet me, Maggie, in hte meadow,
And I'll tell you where I've been,---
Where in Erin I have wandered,
All the sights that I have seen.
First I'll tell you how I love you,---
How I missed your sunny smile;
Then I'll kiss you, and I'll tell you
I was true, dear, all the while.

(CHORUS)

3.
Meet me, Maggie, darling Maggie,---
How I wish the day had flown!
When the little birds are sleeping,
Come to welcome me, my own.
Nevermore shall we be parted,
For me heart shall never rove,---
Like a weary bird it wanders
Back to you, my only love.

(CHORUS)
