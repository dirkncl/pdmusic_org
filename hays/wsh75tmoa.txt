1.
Where gently glides the wand'ring stream
Thro' meadows, field and grove,
Where flowers grew upon its banks,
I met the maid I love;
The stars put on their sweetest smiles,
The moon threw off her vail,
When first I met and dearly loved
The maid of Avondale.

CHORUS
Sweet maid of Avondale,
Fair maid of Avondale,
O! brown-eyed, modest country lass,
Sweet maid of Avondale.

2.
She saw me, blushed, and hung her head,
As I was passing by,
I never would have paused at all,
But her roguish eye;
Love, long imprisoned in my heart,
Broke from its lonely jail,
And left the doors wide open to
The maid of Avondale.

(CHORUS)

3.
Those sparkling eyes of hers looked down,
Her lips refused to speak,
She tossed her playful curls aside,
And let me kiss her cheek;
And then and there 'twas heart for heart,
Tomorrow I will sail
Across the sea, and take with me
The maid of Avondale.

(CHORUS)
