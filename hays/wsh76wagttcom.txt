1.
I used to pick de cotton, and hoe de sugar cane;
But dat was many years ago,
When my good ole massa use to sit and hear
Me playing de ole banjo;
But my har am white on de top of my head,
An' my clothes am thin, an' I ain't fed;
Ole massa and missus both an dead;
Oh! who's a gwine to take care of me?

CHORUS
Oh! who's a gwine to take care of me, Hannah?
Oh! who's a gwine to take care of me, of me,
Oh! who's a gwine to take care of me, Hannah?
I wish massa John was livin' now.

2.
I used to hunt for de 'possom and de coon,
And come home early in de morn,
And work all day wid a very happy heart,
And quit when I heard de dinner horn;
But since dat time, oh! dey set me free,
I wish to de Lord dat dey let me be,
For dem was de good ole times I did see,
Now who's a gwine to take care of me?

(CHORUS)

3.
I don't care to dance an' to sing any more,
De darkies am scattered all around,
Some o' dem's worse off dan dey was before,
An' most o' dem is sleeping in de ground;
I wish I was a good ole slave,
For something to eat I'd never crave,
I'll trabel along till I find my grave:
Oh! who's a gwine to take care of me?

(CHORUS)
