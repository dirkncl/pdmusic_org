1. When the sun thro’ shades of evening
Took her last fond look at day,
Nature seemed to slumber softly, 
As the hours passed away.
Silence whispered to the flowers,
Songsters gathered in each tree,
Joining in one merry chorus,
Singing to sweet Laura Lee.

CHORUS 1-3.
None can tell how much I loved her,
She was good and kind to me;
Heaven claims her as an angel,
Absent loved me, Laura Lee.

2. How her hair is waving tresses
Played about her spotless brow,
Careless with the winds of summer;
O! methinks I see her now.
Her bright eyes like windows open
In he heart when I can see
All the love her lips hath spoken,
Lovely, blackeyed Laura Lee.

3. Years have flown since last we parted
Yet we hoped to meet again,
But my heart is lost in sorrow,
All myh fondest hopes are slain.
She’s as angel pure in heaven,
None can be more true than she,
And I’m growing weary, waiting
To be called by Laura Lee.
