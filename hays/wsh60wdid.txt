1.
Oh Dixie am de paradise
Whar de raise de cotton and de rice,
Come away
Boy's away boy's away,
Down in Dixie
Whar de Gal's grow tall
And de Babies small,
And some folks dey don't grow at all,
Come away boy's away, boy's away down in Dixie.

CHORUS
Then, come let's go to Dixie,
Yah! ho! yah ho!
We'll sing dis song, de whole night long,
When we go down in Dixie.
Away, away,
We'll all be off for Dixie,
Away away,
We'll soon be off for Dixie.

2.
Dar was a girl in Dixie's land,
I ax'd her for her head and hand,
Come away boy's, away boys, away
Down in Dixie,
Then she smiled an' gib me her consent
I got de Gal away we went,
Come away boys, away, boys away down in Dixie.

3.
And when she went to bed one night,
She could'nt see for want of light,
Away! boys, away! away down in Dixie,
She lit de lite, as any one mout,
She put it in bed and blowed her sef out,
  Away! boys, away! away down in Dixie.

(CHORUS)

4.
De boy's down dar dey live on chicken;
And de babies like lasses,--dey want a lickin,
And away! boys, away! away down south in Dixie,
Dar face's am as broad as a farm in de Souf,
Like de Mississippi riber got snag's in de Mouf,
  Then away boys, away down south in Dixie.

(CHORUS)

5.
Oh, come now boys, since you've heard our story,
To de land of light and glory,
Come away, boys, away! away down south in Dixie,
O! our hearts am gay! we're a happy band,
Good bye! folks now for Dixie's land,
  Away! boys, away! away down south in Dixie.

(CHORUS)
