1. 
Ah! many months have glided by, 
We parted on the shore, 
He left the little ones and I, 
Perhaps to meet no more. 
He fought while others round him fell 
Then wrote, “that he would come,” 
Oh! soon how happy I shall be 
I’mlooking for him home, 
I know he’ll hasten back to me 
I’m looking for him home.

2. 
Oh! may the steamer swiftly glide, 
Upon the peaceful sea, 
And gently on its bosom ride, 
And bring him back to me, 
He bravely fought and honours won, 
Wherever he did roam, 
Now peace will reign on land and sea, 
I’m looking for him home, 
For God has spared his life for me, 
I’m looking for him home.

3. 
I see the sunbeams kiss the deep, 
When evening’s drawing nigh; 
And night comes on, I cannot sleep 
No steamer greets my eye, 
He fought the battles and is safe 
I’ll watch the ocean’s foam; 
Peace will be our’s, war will be o’er 
I’m looking for him home 
My heart be still, be sad no more 
I’m looking for him home.
