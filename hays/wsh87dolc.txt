1. De little stars am shinin’ bright an’ winkin at de moon,
De dogs down yonder in de lane an barkin at de coon,
Dat sits upon de ole rail fence aroun de field ob corn,
De birds am tired ob singin songs all day since early morn,
De leaves am dancin on de bosom ob de gentle breeze,
An nature makes de music as it floods among de trees,
I hear old Jim a singin on his way back from de mill,
In his little ole log cabin in de woods on top de hill.

CHORUS 1-2.
Ole Uncle Jim a singin on his way back from the mill,
In dat little ole log cabin in de woods on top de hill.

2. It has a door an window which lets in de light ob day,
De rustle logs am filled between with chips, and yeller clay,
De chickens roost upon de roof, de dog sleeps on de floor,
An creepin vines an big sunflowers grow aroun de door,
A footpath leads down froo de woods, anodder to de spring,
Wid dogs an guns an fishin poles Jim’s happy as a king,
He sings de cares of life away, an whistles loud an shrill,
In dat little ole log cabin in de woods on top de hill.
