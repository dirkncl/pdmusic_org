1.
When the twilight gently gathers,
Round the crimson brow of eve,
And the sun in all its beauty
Is about to take its leave.
O! I sit me at the window,
With our darling on my knee,
And think of your so far away,
Why don't your write to me?

CHORUS
O! I sit me at the window,
With our darling on my knee,
And think of you so far away,
Why don't you write to me?

2.
Evry night when I am kneeling
By my bedside in my prayer,
I call upon the angels
To be with you ev'ry where,
And I'm dreaming of you nightly,
But my heart will not be free,
For fear that something happened you.
Why don't you write to me?

(CHORUS)

3.
The days are long and dreary
And the nights are long and drear,
My heart grows sad and weary
When I wish that you were here.
Then I gaze upon your picture
That your image I might see
And ask with tears of pity O!
Why don't you write to me?

(CHORUS)
