1.
I'm a happy little darkey all the way from Alabam
Whar I used to hoe de cotton and de cane,
An' de white-folks dey will miss me when dey shout for Little Sam;
Kase I'm neber gwine to lib wib dem again.
O! I leff 'em in de night,
When de moon was shining bright,
An' I struck out to find de happy land.
I leff my only brudder
To take care of my mother--
I was bound to be a little contraband.

CHORUS
High, oh! high!
Listen till I tell you who I am!
I'se a roving little darkey,
All de way from Alabam;
I'se as free as anybody
An' dey calls me Little Sam.

2.
De cabin whar I used to lib is settin' on de hill,
And de mockin'-bird is singin' jes' as free,
Whar I used to set and listen to de music ob de rill,
As it headed for de riber to de sea;
And when de work was o'er,
We would gather 'round de door
Ob de cabin---all de darkies in a jam;
An' dey'd keep de banjo ringin'
While dey listen to me singin',
But I ran away to be a contraband.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'se around among the while-folks, doin' for dem all I can,
For to keep me busy workin' all de day;
And when I duz my duty well, dey pays me like a man,
And I goes and puts my money all away;
And I'll save up ebry cent,
'Cept what I've gone and spent,
Kase I'se gwine to travel down to Alabam,
For to see my only brudder
And my dear old ag-ed mother,
Who will gib a welcome home to "Little Sam."

(CHORUS)
