"Down South Whar de Sugar Cane Grows" (1877)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
O! I'm getting old and feeble now, I cannot work no more,
And sigh for de cabin in de lane;
O! it nearly breaks dis heart of mine to think I'll never hear
Ole massa's kind and gentle voice again.
Now I miss de music of de birds dat used to sing to me,
When I was livin' happy with my Rose.
But she's dead, and I am left alone, she's sleepin' in her grave,
Down South whar de sugar cane grows.

CHORUS
Take me back (take me back) to my home, (to my home,)
Down whar de Mississippi flows,
O! I'd love to go and live again de balance of my days,
Down South whar de sugar cane grows.

2.
O! I wish dat I had never, never come away from dar,
And never left de handles of de plow;
On de plantation whar I used to hoe de sugar cane
I know dat I'd be happy now, down dar.
Now de darkeys am all scatter'd, an' I'm told de place am chang'd,
But one thing dis poor old darkey knows,--
I have longed to go and live again upon de ole home-place,
Down South whar de suger cane grows.

3.
O! I miss de darkey's singing as dey gather'd 'round de door,
When de moon was shining just as bright as day,
And I never see dem dance so happy to de ole banjo,
Yes, dance an' sing de happy hours away.
I will never never go an' hunt de 'possum an' de coon,
Nor see de boys a handlin' ob dar hoes,
For I ain't got long to stay here now, I'se gwine home to die,
Down South whar de sugar cane grows.
