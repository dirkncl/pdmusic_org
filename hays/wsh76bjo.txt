1.
The cows were waiting at the gate,
Down yonder in the lane,
And evening in its solitude
Smiled on the fields of grain,
The clover blossoms hung their heads
And flowers bloomed so fair,
When first I saw the modest face
Of bonnie Jean O'Dair.

CHORUS
O! bonnie Jean O'Dair,
the fairest of the fair,
The sweetest girl in all the world
Is bonnie Jean O'Dair.

2.
She wore a plain and modest dress,
And apron white as snow,
It seemed that birds were happiest
Where-ever she would go.
Her eyes smiled 'neath her summer hat,
That shaded well her hair,
Which hung in tresses 'bout the face
Of bonnie Jean O'Dair.

(CHORUS)

3.
It seemed that nature set apart
This rustic-looking place
For birds to sing, and flowers bloom,
To blush before her face;
I thought, if I should look for joy
On earth I'd found it there,
My home would be a paradise,
Its angel, Jean O'Dair.

(CHORUS)
