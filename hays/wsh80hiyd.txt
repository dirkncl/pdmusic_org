Song and Chorus
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
O I remember Hannah when we lived in Louisian'
Whar' I used to hoe de cotton and de cane,
An' we libed in peace and plenty on de banks of Washita
In de little old log cabin in de lane
An' I nebber can forget how you looked at me an' cried,
An you told me not to leave you fo' de wah!
Now I'm sorry dat I lef' you dat I eber come away,
Kase I think of you an' wonder is you dar.

CHORUS
O! Hannah, is you libin yet?
O! Hannah, if you are,
Go an' git somebody fo' ter write me up a letter,
An I'll come to you, Hannah, if you're dar.

2.
I've often sat and wonder'd if de cabin whar' we lived
Is a standin' yet beside de rollin stream,
An dat good old dog is libin yet, dat used to follow me
When my life was just as happy as a dream;
I kin see you sittin, Hannah, in de moolight in de door,
I can hear your voice a singin' from afar;
I can hear de dogs a barkin' at de possum up a tree,
An I weep an' ar your, Hannah, is you dar?

(CHORUS)
