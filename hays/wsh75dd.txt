1.
Dora, darling, sit beside me,
Let your eyes upon me shinel
Listen fondly,--can you, darling,
Come back to this heart of mine?
Long, ah, long have we been strangers,
Though my love could never wane,--
Smile upon me, Dora, darling,
Let's be friends, and love again.

CHORUS
Fondly once we loved each other,
Yes, our parting gave us pain;
Say that in the future, darling,
We'll be friends, and love again.

2.
Dora, darling, don't be weeping,
Lay your head upon my breast,
And I'll tell you how I've loved you,
Loved you only, first and best;
I have often sighed to see you,
At the old gate in the lane;--
Let the past be all forgotten,--
Let's be friends, and love again.

(CHORUS)

3.
Dora, darling, I can never
Teach my fond heart to regret
That I knew you, that I loved you,
No! I fondly love you yet,
And 'twice wrong for you to leave me,
Or to give my fond heart pain,--
As of old, then, Dora, darling,
We'll be friends, and love again.

(CHORUS)
