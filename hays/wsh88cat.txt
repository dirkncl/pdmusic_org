1. The Democrats have won the day,
They’ve donw with party strife,
With Cleveland at the helm will run
This country now for life;
His democratic head is right,
His heart is always warm,
So shout aloud and swell the crowd,
For Revenue Reform.

CHORUS 1-3.
Then hurrah, for Cleveland,
Hurrah, for Thurman too,
We’ll rally ’round the stars and stripes, 
The red, white and blue;
We’ll shout for true Democrary,
And sound the wild alarm
Along the lind and give three cheers
For Revenue Reform.

2. Come all ye honest Democrats,
And join our mighty host,
We love the party as our lives,
But love our country most;
Stand by the good and grand old ship,
We’ll weather ev’ry storm,
And let our watchword always be,
For Revenue Reform.

3. The time has come for Democrats,
Who love their country true.
To stand by Cleveland to the last,
And vote for Thurmen too;
So put your shoulder to the wheel,
And lend a willing arm,
Do all you can to help the cause
Of Revenue Reform.
