1.
Come rally 'round the good old flag,
The North, South, East, and West,
And let all honest Democrats,
Who love their country best,
Rejoice to know the time has come,
When we must take our stand,
And shout aloud, huzza! huzza!
For Hancock is our man.

CHORUS 2 times
We'll give three cheers for Hancock,
And three for English too,
We'll gather 'round the good old flag,
The Red, White, and Blue.

2.
Prosperity will bless the land,
And God will help our cause;
"The Constitution as it it,
The Union as it was."
We'll let the past forgotten be,
And do all that we can,
To choose a leader whom we love,
And Hancock is our man.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
He is a soldier, brave and true,
And he is more than that,
We know he is an honored man,
And faithful Democrat.
We'll put him in the White House chair,
And try an honest plan,
To run this government awhile,
With Hancock for our man.

(CHORUS 2 times)
