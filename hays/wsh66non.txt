To my Friend J. L. Warner, Louisville, KY
"Nora O'Neal" (1866)
A Beautiful Ballad
Written & Composed by
William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
Oh! I'm lonely to night, love, without you,
And I sigh for one glance of your eye;
For there's a charm, love, about you,
When ever I know you are nigh.
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling,
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal,
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling
That I love you, sweet Nora O'Neal.

REFRAIN
Oh! don't think that ever I'll doubt you,
My love I will never conceal;
Oh! I'm lonely tonight, love, without you,
My darling, sweet Nora O''Neal.

2.
Oh! the nightingale sings in the wildwood,
As if every note that he knew,
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood,
To remind me, sweet Nora, of you.
But I think, love, so often about you,
And you know how happy I feel,
But I'm lonely tonight, love, without you,
My darling, sweet Nora O'Neal.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Oh! why should I weep tears of sorrow?
Or why to let hope lose its place?
Won't I meet you, my darling, tomorrow,
And smile on your beautiful face?
Will you meet me? O, say, will you meet me,
With a kiss at the foot of the lane?
And I'll promise whenever you greet me,
That I'll never be lonely again.

(REFRAIN)
