1.
I hear dem sleighbells ringin',
De snow am fallin' fast,
I put dis mule in harness,
An' got him hitch at last.
O, Lisa get your bonnet,
Come and take your seat,
Grab de board you're sittin' on,
An' kiver up your feet.

CHORUS
Whoa! (I tell you!)
Whoa! (I say!)
Keep your seat, my Liza Jane,
An' hold on to de sleigh.

2.
O, watch dis mule a climbin',
For dis aint half a load,
Find a mule dats roomy,
Give him all de road.
An' don't git scared at nuffin
Dat you hear or see;
Liza, I'll stay wid de mule,
An' you must stay wid me.

(CHORUS)

3.
O, see de snow a flying',
Look out! let him sail,
Watch dem ears o' his'n,
See him wag his tail.
Gwine to de preacher's,
Liza, you keep cool,
Aint got time to kiss you now,
I'm busy wid dis mule.

(CHORUS)
