1.
Meet me, Hannah, in de morn,
Gwine out to shuck de corn,
When you hear me blow de horn,
Don't forget me, Hannah.
Let de coon an' possum run,
We's a gwine to hab some fun;
Bake you hoecake in de sun,--
Don't forget me, Hannah.

CHORUS
Hannah, O! Hannah!
Don't you hear me, child?
Go an' wake up Uncle Joe,
Tell him bring his ole banjo,
For many miles I've got to go,--
Don't forget me, Hannah.

2.
Hang dem clothes out on de line,
See de sun, how bright it shine,
Don't you let your heart repine,
Don't forget me, Hannah.
You sing so good, O! sing some more,
Go right off, an' shut dat door,
Sweetest gal I ever saw,--
Don't forget me, Hannah.

(CHORUS)

3.
Put dem taters in de pan,
Lif' de ashes wid your hand,
Meet me in de promised land,--
Don't forget me, Hannah.
When you get your wings to fly,
Over yonder, when you die,
I will meet you bye and bye,--
Don't you forget me, Hannah.

(CHORUS)
