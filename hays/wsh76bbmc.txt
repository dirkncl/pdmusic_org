1.
Bring back my child again,
Bring him to me;
Life is but weary pain;
Hark to my plea!
Let me but fold its form in my embrace,
Let me but gaze once more on its dear face.
Ah! I am dying; how chilly I feel!
Husband, oh, pity me! hear me appeal!
Come, darling, come, I am faint, I am weak,
Hear me implore you, I hardly can speak!

CHORUS
Bring back my child again; hear me, I pray!
See, I am dying, don't take it away,
Let me but see again how sweet it smiled,
Then I'll die happy; Oh, bring back my child!

2.
Bring back my child again---
Back to my breast;
Let its dear form in peace
Near me still rest,
Stand by my dying bed; there let it stay
Till I have kissed its lips---passing away;
Then, darling husband, I leave it with you;
Touch it the journey in life to pursue;
Come, darling, come, Kindly heed me, I pray!
Hark to my pleading, I'm passing away.

(CHORUS)

3.
Bring back my child again---
See, I must die;
Husband, come near to me,
Bless you, don't cry!
See, I am sinking now, kneel down in prayer;
Promis you'll meet me, love, meet me 'up there.'
Oh, I'm so weary! I struggle for breath!
Soow will I silent be, folded in death;
Come, husband, come, One fond kiss, and goodbye!
Let me but press your hand, soon shall I die.

(CHORUS)
