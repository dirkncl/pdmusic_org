1.
The gentle breath of summer
Had kissed the brow of night,
The moon was in her splendor,
The stars were shining bright;
When on the silent door-knob,
The lonely crape was tied,
And friends were sadly weeping,
When little Mamie died.

CHORUS
The pearly gates were open,
And angels stood beside,
To welcome home a stranger,
When little Mamie died.

2.
They closed the shutters gently,
And robed in spotless white,
They watched her little spirit,
To Heaven take its flight.
She smiled upon her mother,
In vain to speak she tried,
But there was solemn silence,
When little Mamie died.

(CHORUS)

3.
The angels met in Heaven,
And with a crown did wait,
To welcome home another,
Within the pearly gate.
A mother's eyes look'd upwards,
A voice to Heaven cried:
"My little darling's coming,"
The night that Mamie died.

(CHORUS)
