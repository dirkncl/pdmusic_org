1.
My heart feels sad, tonight,--
From loved ones far I roam,
And tears come to mine eyes,
Whene'er I think of home;
The home I'll ne'er forget,
While mem'ry shall remain,
Oh! how I long to see
My dear old home again.

CHORUS
My home, my boyhood home,
That stands down by the lane,
Oh! how I long to see, once more,
That dear old home again.

2.
The house was built of stone,
The climney built of clay,
Among the flow'rs and trees,
The birds sang sweet all day;
And from the little porch
I've seen the fields of grain,--
Oh! how I long to see
That dear old home again.

(CHORUS)

3.
I never can forget
The smiles of each one's face,
That used to gather round
The cheerful fireplace;
My poor heart would forget
Its sorrow and its pain,
If I could only see
That dear old home again.

(CHORUS)
