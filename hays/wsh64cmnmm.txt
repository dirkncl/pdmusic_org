1. Call me no more, Mother, Call me no more—
Call me not back from “the echoless shore.”
Where the bright angels assemble ’round me
Watching and waiting, dear Mother, for thee.
I feel thy soft hand as it soothes o’er my cheek,
And even in death, ah! me thinks that you speak,
I hear your sweet voice, but oh! I implore,
Call me not back, Mother, Call me no more.

CHORUS 1-3.
Close her bright eyes, she is sweetly at rest,
Fold he white hands on her cold, chilly breast;
Angels surround her and Heavenward soar—
Call her no back, Mother, Call her no more.

2. Old death, spare the grief of a found Mother’s heart
Breaking and bleeding, to think she must part—
Part, and forever. with Mary on earth,
When all knew to love— God best knew her worth.
Angels had called her to dwell in the skies,
Where they could shine in the light of her eyes,
Life’s storms and tempests around us may roar,
Call her not back, Mother, Call, her no more.

3. Mary, dear Mary, these warm tears will start—
Drops of affection that come from my heart,
Will steal from mine eyelids and die on my cheek;
My heart yields them, Mary, my lips cannot speak.
Ye angels assemble and smile on her face,
Fold her, each one, in the tender embrace;
Crown her the brightest of all “gone before,”
Call her not back Mother, Call her no more.
