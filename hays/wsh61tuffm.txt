1.
America! Gem of the wide, wide world,
Proud Nation, O! still do I love thee,
The Stars, and the Stripes, to the breeze is unfurl'd,
While the Eagle Soars proudly above thee,
Kentucky! thou beautiful land of my birth,
To love thee, has been my endeavor;
May thy Star ever shine on this beautiful earth,
And cling to the Union forever.

CHORUS
"No North, no South, no East, no West,"
But a Glorious land of the free,
While there's life, or a love, or a heart in my breast,
The Union forever, for me.

2.
Thy Son's are a brave as thy Daughters are fair,
And as true as the Heaven's above them;
May they Cling to the Union wherever they are,
While such "beautiful Girls" live and love them.
Could the dead arise from their graves to day,
Would the Union thus threaten to Sever?
No! Webster, and "By the Eternal" and Clay.
Would thunder, the Union forever.

(CHORUS)

3.
This Glorious Union! -- dear land of the free!
Oh! who can refuse a communion?
There's a Name that will live on the land and sea
'Tis Kentucky? -- the Pride of the Union.
"United we Stand, and divided we fall."
Forsake, not your Motto, No! Never!
For We'll be the last, tho' disunion Slay all,
We will Cling to the Union forever.

(CHORUS)
