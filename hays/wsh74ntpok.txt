1.
How dear to my heart is the thatch-covere'd cottage,
The home of my boyhood for many a day,
The beautiful flowers that grew in the garden,
The smoke making wreaths from the chimney of clay,
The old-fashioned porch, with its little low ceiling,
The birds sang their songs with such innocent glee,
The footpath that led me so oft through the clover,
To beautiful Nora, the pride of Kilkee.

CHORUS
If beauty was ever intended for maidens,
If innocence ever in woman could be,
If Heaven intended to give earth an angel,
'Twas beautiful Nora, the pride of Kilkee.

2.
The love which she gave me in girlhood I cherish,
The hand which she promised I'm waiting for yet;
The kiss at the door as a pledge of affection,
The teardrop at parting, I'll never forget.
There's a love in my heart, that will live there forever,
A love that's far deeper than life is to me;
'Twas the first and the last, for my heart knows no other,
Than beautiful Nora, the pride of Kilkee.

(CHORUS)

3.
I soon will return to the scenes of my boyhood,
The land of old Erin,---the home of my birth,
Where some one is waiting for me with a welcome;
That some one's the fairest and dearest on earth;
Tomorrow I'll write her, and tell her I'm coming,
To have a warm kiss of sweet welcome for me,
And never again will I part with my darling,
My beautiful Nora, the pride of Kilkee.

(CHORUS)
