"100 Years Ago" (1876)
Words by J. A. Nunes
Music by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
A hundred years are sparkling bright
Upon our nation's brow,
Which like a diadem of light,
Is wreath'd with glory now!
Those years have made our infant land
The foremost land on earth,
And wrought a history as grand
In "enterprize" and "worth."

CHORUS
Columbia, she, on land and see
Commands respect and awe;
While ev'ry son shouts "Washington!"
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!

2.
A hundred years! a jewel, each
Surrounds our stars and stripes,
Which earth's extremest confines reach
With earth's sublimest types;---
With types of virture from a soil
Where virtues multiply,---
Types of true wisdom, courage, toil,---
All pointing to the sky.

(CHORUS)

3.
A hundred years? in time, no more;
But in events, how grand!
How must imagination soar,
To feel and understand
That in our natal day, the seed
Of Freedom's tree took birth,
Whose branches since, in fact and deed,
Have panoplied the earth.

(CHORUS)

4.
A hundred years? oh, country dear,
Live on for thousand[s] more?
To abrogate all craven fear,
To eliminate the poor,
To teach the lesson nations need,
Which all the world may scan,
That government's nor Lord nor creed,
But servant is to man.

(CHORUS)
