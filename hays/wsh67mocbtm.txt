1.
Stars of the evening shining so bright,
Smile in thy beauty this soft summer night;
See how the moon gaily floats thru' the skies,
Wink at her passing those heavenly eyes;
Gentle winds sighing thro' meadow and vale,
Bearing the flowers some marvelous tale.
Take me a message far over the sea,
Mary, dear Mary, O come back to me.

CHORUS
Lonely, so lonely! happy I'll be,
If Mary, dear Mary, will come back to me.

2.
Do you remember when we did part,
How your eyes when weeping troubled my heart?
How your lips trembled when saying "goodbye?"
A tear for a tear and a sigh for a sigh.
Where are you roving, my loved one tonight?
Smile on the moon in her wand'ring flight,
So that your image I once more may see,
And beg you, dear Mary, to come back to me.

(CHORUS)

3.
Come to the cottage--land of your birth,
Come to the house that is dearest on earth;
Come to the heart that is loving you still,
I'll kiss you a welcome, come when you will;
Eyes that were weeping when last we did part,
Fondly will smile thro' the door of my heart;
Write me letter from over the sea,
Tell me, dear Mary, you'll hasten to me.

(CHORUS)
