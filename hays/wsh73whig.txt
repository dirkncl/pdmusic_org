1.
Oh! mother, tell me, did the angels
Come a little while to stay,
Then go back again to heaven,
Taking Ida far away?
Tell me, mother, why you're weeping!
You are not yet left alone!
I am with you, look up, tell me,
Where has little Ida gone?

CHORUS
Angels listen, hear me pleading,
I have lost my little one!
Is she with you, only tell me,
Where, Oh! where has Ida gone (yes gone)? 

2.
I remember when you kissed her,
Just before she closed her eyes!
And she whispered, "I am going,"
As she pointed to the skies!
Did she let the angels take her?
Has her spirit with them flown?
Is she up in heaven? tell me,
Where has little Ida gone?

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh! mother, is she now with father,
In their home in yonder sky?
When they live and wait with angels--
Wait to welcome you and I?
Do not weep, Oh! mother dearest!
Look to Him upon the throne!
And a voice will come from heaven,
Telling us where Ida's gone.

(CHORUS)
