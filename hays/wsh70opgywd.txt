1.
I met her at the skatin' rink,
She look'd so sly at me,
She had de neatest little foot
Dat eber I did see,
She stole my heart an' win my lub
An' spoil my happiness,
An' got me nearly crazy 'bout
De gal in de muslin dress.

REFRAIN
O! pshaw! gal! You wont do!
O! pshaw! gal! Go way!
Give me my heart and set me free,
O! pshaw! quit, you're foolin' me.

2.
I called to see my Liza Jane,
She came down to de door,
I neber seed her look so gay
In all my life before,
I asked her if she lubbed me true,
She shouted out "O! yes!"
An' left me rather doubtful 'bout
De gal in de muslin dress.

(REFRAIN)

3.
She got her eyes on big foot Jim,
What drives a charcoal cart,
He went a courtin Liza Jane,
An' robber her ob her heart,
An' leff me weepin' like a clam
In trubble and distress,
Dat made me wish I'd nebber seed
De gal in de muslin dress.

(REFRAIN)

4.
She married Jim, an' he run off,
An' broke dat poor gal's heart,
He didn't leave a thing behind
But a busted charcoal cart,
So now she is a widder bold,
An' she looks gay I guess,
You'll know her when you are her out,
She's a gal in de muslin dress.
