1.
Where the roses bloom, my darling,
And the balmy breath of spring
Stoops to kiss the hawthorne blossoms,
And the birds begin to sing,---
Where the streamlet loves to whisper
Gentle music on the air,
At the gate down by the meadow,
I will meet you, then and there.

CHORUS
O, I am sure you'll not forget me,
For I know how true you are;
At the gate, down by the meadow,
I will meet you, then and there.

2.
When the birds are tired of singing,
And have gone away to rest,
When the eye of day is closing
In the far-off distant west,
Where the Ivy and the Myrtle
Hyde amid the flowers rare,
At the gate down by the meadow,
I will meet you, then and there.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the stars look at us smiling,
And the moon has hid her face,
When the flashing eyes, of Cupid
Lead you to our meetingplace,
Where your heart and mine happy,
As all faithful lovers are,
At the gate down by the meadow,
I will meet you, then and there.

(CHORUS)
