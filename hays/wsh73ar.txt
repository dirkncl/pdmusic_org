1.
By the old mill in the valley,
At the foot of yonder hill,
Where the nightowl loves to listen
To the plaintive whiporwill;
Where the little running brooklet
Makes its music night and day,
And all nature looks so lovely,--
Lives my pretty Ada Ray.

CHORUS 2 times
Oh! It seems she is an angel,
Come a little while to stay,
Till she's wanted back in heaven;
Pretty blue-eyed Ada Ray.

2.
I have met her in the meadow,
She was driving home the cows,
And the boys were on their horses
Going homeward from their plows.
I have told her that I loved her,
And she'd not a word to say,
'Twas her smile that plainly told me
I was loved be Ada Ray.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
I have met her in the clover,
And we stood beneath a tree,
I took her hand and asked her
Who she loved? she looked at _me_,
Then blushed, for I had kissed her,
And I'll not regret the day,
I met and loved, I wooed and won
My pretty Ada Ray.

(CHORUS 2 times)
