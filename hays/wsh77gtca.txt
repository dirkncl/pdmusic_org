1.
String de banjo, dit de bones,
Play de fiddle too,
Gwine to have de good ole times,
Plenty work to do.
Got out in de cottenfield,
Hoe de sugar cane,
Hunt de 'possm an' de coon,
De good time's come again.

CHORUS
We gwine to pick de cotton,
An' hoe de sugar cane,
Dance all night, till broad daylight,
When de good times come again.

2.
Darkies rolling cotton fast,
Down de river bank,
Steamboat waiting for it dar,
Take it on de plank.
See dem fore de fiah doors,
Hear em singin' plain,
Bless me soul,
I feel so good,
De good time's come again.

(CHORUS)

3.
Plenty ham an' tater now,
Couldn't ax for more,
No excuse for darkey say,
Hungry, weak an' poor.
Go into de cornfield dar,
Git to raising grain,
Plow an' mow, an' reap an' sow,
De good time's come again.

(CHORUS)

4.
I'se gwine back to Alabam,
Gwine dar to stay,
Git back in de cottenfield,
Never come away.
Don't care wat de oders do,
No cause to complain,
Tings ain't like dey used to be,--
De good time's come again.

(CHORUS)
