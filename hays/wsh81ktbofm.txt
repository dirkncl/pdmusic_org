1.
Oh! my darling, how I miss you,
As I lonely, sadly roam;
In my heart I'm fondly wishing
I was with you all at home.
Think of me-- I love you dearly!
Let your heart still happy be;
For I nightly pray "God bless you,"
Kiss the baby once for me.

CHORUS
Darling, dearest, don't forget me,
How I long your face to see;
Don't forget my tender message,
Kiss the baby once for me.

2.
When at home you're lonely sitting,
And you wish that I was there;
Does your heart feel sad and lonely
When you see a vacant chair?
When our little darling Eva,
Playful, climbs upon your knee,
Take her up, and then embrace her,
Kiss the baby once for me.

(CHORUS)
