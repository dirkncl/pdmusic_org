1. Amid life’s many changing scenes,
Wherever you may be,
Fair Lillian, I have always found
That you’ve been true to me.
No matter where I chance to roam,
On me you can depend,
Let come what will for weal or woe,
Remember, I’m your friend.

CHORUS 1-3.
As down the hill of life we go,
Through so our journey’s end,
Let come what will you’ll always find
That I am still your friend.

2. Since first I met you, Lillian fair,
We’ve often had to part,
The meetings always brought us joy
To each confiding heart.
We’ve trusted in each other’s love,
We’ll take what God may send,
But don’t forget the one true thought,
Remember, I’m your friend.

3. Ah! tiime nor age can chill the heart,
That’s warm in love for you,
For friendship such as you profess,
We’ll make it fonder, true.
At home, abroad, on land or sea,
May angels on you ’tend,
And in your prayers, O, think of me,
For Lillian, I’m your friend.
