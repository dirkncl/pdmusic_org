1.
Gently the moon mounts the skies,
Stars their night watches do keep,
Why let those tears dim thine eyes,
Thine were not made, love, to weep,
Look up and tell me you love me,
Grief nearly breaks my young heart.
Smile once again in mine eyes
And kiss me, kiss me ere we part.

CHORUS
Good bye, darling, good bye.
Do not grieve or miss me.
I must go and leave you weeping,
O, kiss me, darling, kiss me.

2.
Smile once again ere I go,
Tell me you heart will be true,
Mine be the pleasure to know,
Loving, I love none but you,
Tell me when absent you'll love me,
Lips speak the love of my heart.
Come, do not weep, love, for me,
But kiss me, kiss me ere we part.

(CHORUS)

3.
Farewell, my loved one, my own,
O but be true unto me,
Soon will me life's bark be thrown
Out in the tempest at sea.
I'm going, my darling, I'll love you.
Smile lest you break my poor heart.
O come, let me tell you, good bye,
And kiss me, kiss me ere we part.

(CHORUS)
