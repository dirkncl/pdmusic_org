1.
Up in the morning early,
Kissing the brow of day,
Sweet birds softly singing
Songs, both blithe and gay;
Nature is smiling sweetest,
Kissed by morning dew,
Making life a pleasure,
Bringing sunlight, too.

CHORUS 2 times
Sunlight, moonlight, starlight
Give to you and me,
Take, what now I offer you,
One, (kiss), two (kiss), three (kiss).

2.
Ev'ning shadows gather,
Birds have gone to rest,
White sails softly flitting
On the ocean's breast.
All the world seems happy,
Old love turns to new,
Time its wings unfolding,
Bringing moonlight, too.

(CHORUS)

3.
Clouds with silver linings
Float across the skies,
Smiles from stars are flitting
Bright as lover's eyes.
Curtains hanging gently,
Azure's pale and blue,
Adding love and beauty,
To the starlight, too.

(CHORUS)
