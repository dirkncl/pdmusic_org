1.
Come sit beside me Stella, and take old grandpa's hand,
It is eighty years ago today since I was born;
And eleven years tomorrow since your mamma passed away,
Leaving Stella with your poor grandpa here forlorn:
For your papa went to sea, and had perished in the deep
And your grandma died of sorrow for his fate
But the angels soon shall bear me to a fairer land than this
Leaving Stella yet a little while to wait.

CHORUS
Yet O my little darling, for thy sake I've longed to live!
For my heart is fill'd with sadness for thy fate;
But the Angels soon shall bear me, to a fairer land than this
Leaving Stella yet a little while to wait.

2.
Come nearer, nearer Stella-- let me press thee to my heart
In thy chasten'd look of sadness I can see
Thy mother's sunny smile, breaking through the dismal gloom,
That veils her orphan'd darling's destiny.
Yes, the angels soon shall lead them, in the straight and narrow way,
When this feeble arm that guards thee now is gone;
And thy future shall be brightness as thy past hath been so dark,
Till thy time-allotted pilgrimage is done.

CHORUS
Then farewell, my darling Stella, let me kiss away thy tears,
For my faith and hopes grow stronger in thy fate,
As the Angels come to bear me to a fairer land than this
Leaving Stella yet a little while to wait.
