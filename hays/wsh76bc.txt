1.
Beautiful child; have you no home?
Look up and tell me, why do you roam?
Why are you walking alone in the street,
Asking the people for something to eat?
God bless you poor little innocent soul,
How the sad tears from your hazel eyes roll;
All the day pleading with strangers to give;
Speak to me, little one, where do you live?

CHORUS
Beautiful child, the angels above
Watch o'er your footsteps in pity and love;
Lonely and sad on earth you may roam,
But angels are waiting to welcome you home.

2.
Beautful child; out in the storm,
'Round you are mansions happy and warm;
Where do you go when you leave the cold street?
Thin is your garment,---no shoes on your feet;
Don't weep so!---tell me, I think you said
Father and mother and sister were dead;
Weary and lonely your lot you pursue;
Earth's a sad place for such orphans as you.

(CHORUS)

3.
Beautiful child; angels will wait!
Keep your bright eyes on the beautiful gate,
While you go on thro' this city of sin,
Don't be afraid that they'll not let you in!
God and his angels are loving you still,
You are but doing his heavenly will!
Soon you'll be done with all sorrow and care,
Soon you will dwell in his mansions so fair.

(CHORUS)
