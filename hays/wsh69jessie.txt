1.
When the summer night winds echo through the vale,
Echoing the sweet notes of the nightingale,
While the nightowl listens to his merry tune,
Sitting in the treetop winking at the moon,
Then I love to wander through the shady grove,
Guided by the moonbeams to the lass I love.
Sitting lonely waiting, wishing I was nigh,
Jessie with the light brown eye.

2.
Often have we met and parted at the stile,
Parted with a teardrop, meeting with a smile,
Happy hours of pleasure ours to enjoy,
She a happy lassie, I a merry boy,
We grew up together loving, kind and true,
And no other true love either of us knew,
She I gave my heart to, modest, bright and fair,
Jessie with the light brown hair.

3.
Down in yonder village close beside the wood
Lives my darling Jessie, gentle, kind and good,
Waiting for somebody, soon she hopes to see,
With a kiss of welcome, with a smile for me,
Soon I'm going to ask her if she'll be my bride,
Fill my cup of pleasure-- run it o'er with pride.
Then forever happy in this life we'll be,
Jessie my true love and me.
