1.
Snowflakes glisten'd in the moonlight,
  Falling ev'rywhere,
Sleighbells rung their merry voices
  On the wintry air.
Ev'ry gallant had his lassie,
  Dashing down Broadway,
I had mine, and we were happy,
  Riding in a sleigh.

2.
Dashing out the road to Brighten,
  Sliding o'er the snow,
Horses panting, eager racing,
  "Mercy, how they go!"
Twenty sleighs and fifty horses
  Going out that way,
While the merry girls are laughing,
  Riding in a sleigh.

3.
Whips were cutting, drivers shouting,
  Horses flying fast,
Sleighs upsetting, voices yelling,
  As they quickly passed;
Till at last the race was ended,
  Morn was turning gray,
Homeward came the jolly parties,
  Riding in a sleigh.

4.
Coming home with Kate beside me,
  Crossing o'er the ridge,
I turn'd round and slyly kiss'd her,
  Coming 'cross the bridge.
Then she asked how many bridges
  On our journey lay,
And I answer'd, "_Count the kisses,_"
  Riding in a sleigh.

5.
Coming home, and near the mansion,
  (This I will confess,)
But I ask'd her--well, no matter,--
  For she answer'd, "Yes!"
On a certain night this winter,
  I'll not name the day,
But there'll be a preacher with us,
  Riding in a sleigh.
