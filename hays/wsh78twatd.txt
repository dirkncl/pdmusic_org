1. “Mama, look out at the beautiful snow,
Hark! how the merciless cold winds blow,
See how the streets are all mantled in white,
What are you thinking of, papa, tonight?
Why are you weeping so silent and sad?
I know papa’s gone, but can’t I make you glad?
Come kiss me mamma, and don’t weep no more,”
Hush! listen my child, there’s a wolf at the door. 

CHORUS 1-3.
Pity the fatherless child, ere it dies,
Pity the widow with tears in her eyes;
Go help the homeless, the friendless, and poor,
Do all you can,— drive the wolf from the door.

2. “Mama, don’t weep: see me kneel at your feet,
I know you are cold, and we’ve nothing to eat,
I’m weary and footsore, I’ve gone out and tried,
So hard to beg something, but I’ve been denied,
Oh! why do you tremble, you’ve nothing to fear,
The fire’s gone out, and ’tis very cold here,
Put your head on my lap, you can sleep on the floor,”
No! child, there’s no sleep, there’s a wolf at the door.

3. “Mamma! God bless you! cheer up all you can,
Some day I may be a good honest man,
But while I am nothing, as yet, but a boy,
Please let me speak to your breaking heart, joy,
Though papa is dead, there is one left us still,
Friends may forsake us, but God never will,
Come let’s go to sleep,” and their trouble’s were o’er,
And the verdict was “dead,” found a wolf at the door.
