1.
Come rally 'round the good old flag,
The North, South, East, and West,
And let all honest Democrats,
Who love their country best,
Rejoice to know the time has come,
When we must take our stand,
And shout aloud, huzza! huzza!
For Cleveland is our man.

CHORUS 2 times
We'll give three cheers for Cleveland,
And three for Hendricks too,
We'll gather 'round the good old flag,
The Red, White, and Blue.
We'll give three cheers for Cleveland,
And three for Hendricks too,
We'll gather 'round the good old flag,
The Red, White, and Blue.

2.
Prosperity will bless our land,
And God will help our cause;
"The Constitution as it is,
The Union as is was."
We'll let the past for gotten be,
And do all that we can,
To choose a leader whom we love,
And Cleveland is our man.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
He is a soldier, brave and true,
And he is more than that,
We know he is an honest man,
And faithful Democrat.
We'll put him in the White House chair,
And try an honest plan,
To run this government awile,
With Cleveland for our man.

(CHORUS 2 times)
