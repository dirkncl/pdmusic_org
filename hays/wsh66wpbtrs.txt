"We Parted by the River Side" (1866)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
We parted by the river side,
The moon looked down on you and me,
The stars put on a look of pride,
The river murmured to the sea;
The dewdrops kissed the blushing rose,
The gentle winds did sigh;
One word broke nature's sweet repose,
That sad word was "Goodby!" Oh!

CHORUS
Tell me that you love me yet,
For, oh! the parting gives me pain;
Say, tell me, that you'll not forget,
For we may never meet again.

2.
We parted by the river side,
A teardrop trembled on your cheek,
In vain to tell my love I tried,
My heart was sad -- I could not speak;
I promised that I would be true,
So long as I would live;
The parting kiss I gave to you,
Was all I had to give. Oh!

(CHORUS)

3.
We parted by the river side,
And I have roamed a distant clime,
My heart has not forgot its pride,
For I have loved you all the time;
And I am faithful to you still,
While I believe you true;
Afar or near let come what will,
I'll love you -- only you. Oh!

(CHORUS)
