1. There’s not a moment of my life
But what my memory, fond and true,
Like some lone bird seeks its mate
Flies on the wings of love to you.
I see yonder fair and faultless form
In all my dreams your face is seen,
I breathe your name to every pray’r;
My own, my darling Josephine.

CHORUS 1-2.
O! Josephine, Josephine, my own fair queen,
I swear by heav’n above you,
My heart is true, my heart is true, sweet girl, to you, to you,
Josephine, I love you.

2. O! when I see your soullit eyes,
In all their beauty on me shine,
I feel as if some angel fair
Had come to give her smiles for mine,
But, when my lips give kiss for kiss
And life is happy and serene,
All earth becomes a heaven, then,
And you’re its angel Josephine.
