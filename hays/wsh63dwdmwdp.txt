1. ’Twas down South in Dixoe,
Whar dey raise de Rice and Cotton,
And took it to the Northern States
And swap’d if off for Bacon,
Dey bof had so much
Dey did’nt know what to do,
So this bloody war commenced
With the Hoop te do den do.

CHORUS 1-3.
I tell you what it is,
I’se at de bottom ob de fuss,
Dat’s what I told you
Was de matter wid de purps,
I tell you what it is,
I’se at de bottom ob de fuss,
Dat’s what I told you
Was de matter with de purps.

2. De bacon spil’t on our hands,
De souf burnt up de Cotton,
And den came de Proclamation,
Which dis Nigga’s not forgotten.
’Twas a Victory for de Souf,
And Split de Norf in two,
Dey went to fighting about old  Cuff,
Wid de hoop de do’n doo.

3. Dey drafted in the Souf,
And made a mighty splatter,
Dey found it hard to whip de Yanks,
And dat is whats de matter.
Massa Abe, he did the Conscript try, 
But found it wouldn’t do,
New York raised the bloody cry,
With the hoop de do’n doo.

4. De Yanks fight de Secesh,
And de Secesh fight de Yankee’s,
It was mighty hard to tell,
Who had gained de most advantage.
Abe called out his Nigga boy’s,
And Jeff, said he would too,
So its Nigga fight de Nigga,
Wid de hoop to do’n doo.

CHORUS 4.
When dis Cruel war is over,
Spec de bo’f will have de worst,
Dat’s what I told you,
Was de Matter wid de purp’s,
When dis Cruel war is over,
Spec de bo’f will have de worst,
Dat’s what I told you,
Was de Matter wid de purp’s.
