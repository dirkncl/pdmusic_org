1.
O! tears of anguish on thy cheek,
So pale and wan with care.
O! come no more to dim mine eyes,
Lie dead and buried there.
Is there no comfort from above,
This grief of mine to kill,
No angels' pity, or their love?
Be still, poor heart, be still!

CHORUS
Sweet angels, O! for pity's sake,
Thy Heavenly mission fill;
O! soothe my heart, or it must break,
Be still, poor heart, be still!

2.
I feel a grief beyond control,
And I would freely give
All that I have, except my soul,
If I could only live.
Live, but to kiss the chast'ning rod,---
Die, subject to His will,
And cry no more for help from God;
Be still, poor heart, be still!

(CHORUS)

3.
It is my soul that makes me fear---
I feel a trembling there.
O! God, in pity bow Thine ear,
And listen to my prayer.
Speak to my soul ere 'tis too late,
Let death come when it will,
O! how much longer must I wait?
Be still, poor heart, be still!

(CHORUS)
