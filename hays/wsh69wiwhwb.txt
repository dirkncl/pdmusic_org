1.
The mellow one was sleeping on
The bosom of the night,
And Nature looked as if the moon
Was glad to see the sight,
My heart was happy and I felt
Within my bosom swell
A friendship near akin to love,
When I went home with Belle.

CHORUS
I asked her if she loved me,
She smiled but would not tell,
But held her gentle hand in mine,
When I went home with Belle.

2.
Her dark brown eyes, looked love in mine
As down the lane we strayed,
While ringlets of her glossy hair
About her shoulders played,
I drew her closer to my side,
At last I broke the spell,
And told her how I fondly loved,
When I went home with Belle.

(CHORUS)

3.
The moon and stars were watching us
For it was growing late
And eyes were smiling love to eyes
When we stood at the gate,
I've got a ting I'm wearing now,
But whose, I'll never tell;
I took it with a kiss that night,
When I went home with Belle.

(CHORUS)
