1.
There's no home like the old home,
Down by the murm'ring stream,
Where childhood's sunny hours
Passed like a cheerful dream;
The chimney built of stone and clay,
The ceilings, brown and low.
There's no home like the old home
Of many years ago.

CHORUS 2 times
There's no home (like the old home,)
That I shall ever know; (ever know;)
I can't forget the old home
Of Forty years ago.

2.
There's no home like the old home,
The cheerful fire at night,
The little dingy window panes,
That led in all the light;
The path of stones,--the walk that led
From gate to portico.
There's no home like the old home
Of Forty years ago.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
There's no home like the old home,
Where pride ne'er has its fall,
The home where happy hearts are found,
Is palace of them all;
The rich and proud in mansions grand
May all life's pleasures know,
But give to me the good old home
Of Forty years ago.

(CHORUS 2 times)
