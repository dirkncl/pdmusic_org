"Old Uncle Ben the Colored Refugee" (1869)
(Song and Chorus.)
by William Shakespeare Hays, 1837-1907

1.
The old long cabin stands alone,
Beside the winding stream,
Whose echoes sound so sweet at night,
Like music in a dream,
The mocking bird sings blighe and gay,
The coon [runs up?] the tree,
The moon looks down on Uncle Ben,
The colored Refugee.

CHORUS
He's sad and lonely, weak and poor,
'Way down in Tennessee,
O! let us pity Uncle Ben
the colored Refugee.

2.
The banjo which he used to play,
Hangs up behind the door,
The strings have broken one by one,
He cannot play it more,
His old dog licks him in the face,
And climbs upon his knee,
And moans aloud for Uncle Ben
The colored Refugee.

(CHORUS)

3.
When night comes on, the blossoms wild
Perfume the southern air,
And uncle Ben lies down to sleep--
To dream away his care,
He hears the angels singing sweet,
While one comes down to see
If death has kissed old Uncle Ben,
The colored Refugee.

(CHORUS)
