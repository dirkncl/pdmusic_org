1.
Angels have hung out their lamps in the sky,
Evening has shadowed the brow of the day;
Papa, come sit down and answer me why
Death called my beautiful mother away!
When her sweet darling beside her they led,
How I remember she looked up and smiled!
Softly she called you unto her and said:
"Promise you'll cherish and care for your child!"

CHORUS
Softly she called you unto her, and said:
"Promise you'll cherish and car for your child!"

2.
Many a night have poor poor mother and me
Sat by the window, and, watching the gate,
Weeping she'd ask me, "Oh, where can he be?
What can be keeping your papa so late?"
Weary with waiting, she kissed me and said,
Just like an angel, so pleasant and mild,---
"I'll watch and I'll wait, darling, go to your bed:"
Then she would pray both for you and her child!

CHORUS
"I'll watch and I'll wait, darling, go to your bed:"
Then she would pray both for you and her child!

3.
Papa, stay home, please don't leave me tonight!
Think of dear momma, in prayer let me bow,
Asking "our Father" to guide you aright!
Papa, remember, I'm motherless now!
Kneel down with me, papa, come, let us pray,
Mother, oh, smile as in life you once smiled!
Father in heaven, show papa the way,
He may go home with his motherless child!

CHORUS
Father in heaven, show papa the way,
He may go home with his motherless child!
