1.
All night they sat, with tearful eyes,
Beside the quiet bed;
The husband, weeping o'er his wife,
In anguish bowed his head;
The bloom of life had left her cheek,
Her eyes were dim and wild,
When gazing round, she faintly cried:
"May heaven protect my child!"

CHORUS
"My child," the dying mother said,
Then on her husband smiled;
She clasped it in her cold embrace,
Her last words were "my child."

2.
Her youthful brow was calm and pale,
Her hair in ringlets lay
Upon her snowy pillow, while
Her spirit passed away.
One moment more she moved her lips,
As if by love beguiled;
And smiling on her husband, said:
"May heaven protect my child!"

(CHORUS)

3.
They laid her hands across her breast,
When morning brightly shone;
There was a stillness in the room,
For Death reigned there alone!
The strongest hearts were bowed with grief,
Peace from her eyelids smiled!
Oh, loving hands will soothe and bless
That mother's lonely child!

(CHORUS)
