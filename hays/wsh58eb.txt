1.
There's a gentle black eye'd maiden,
And her name is Ella Bell,
Dwelling in a little Cottage near the mill.
'Round that cottage flow'rs are growing,
Near a stream so gently flowing,
It was there I met sweet Ella, on the hill.
We have roam'd the woods together, 
And we dearly loved each other,
When in childhood's days we gather'd roses sweet ---
And within those shady bowers,
I have pluck'd the fairest flow'rs,
And scatter'd them in beauty, at her feet.

2.
Many years ago we parted,
When from Ella's side I started,
Whisper'd she to me so softly in my ear.
While the tears fell down her face
As we took the last embrace,
And she smiled and said, "Remember, Ella Bell."
I have lov'd e'er since I met then,
And I never can forget thee,
Tho' far o'er the deep blue ocean, I may dwell ---
Soon my heart will cease to yearn,
For tomorrow I'll return,
And wander by the side of Ella Bell.
