1.
Remember thee! Yes! loved one,
Oh! how can I forget?
I never shall forget thee,
’Till the sun of life has set,
Though I may roam afar from home,
I care not where I’ll be,
But ’ere I go, Oh! let me know,
Will you remember me?

CHORUS
Oh! Fare thee well! lips cannot tell,
How happy I will be,
If I but know, sweet one that you,
Would still remember me.

2.
I never shall forget the night,
You wished me “pleasant dreams”
The moon looked smiling from the skies,
On valleys, hills and streams.
But ere we part, Oh! take my heart,
For ’twill be true to thee,
And while away, oh! night and day,
Will you remember me.
