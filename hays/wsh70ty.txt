1.
'Tis many years since first we met,
When youth was in its prime;
You've made my life a joy to me,--
One long sweet summer time.
Our friendship ripened into love;
My heart but you adores,
And day or night I love but you,
I still am--"truly yours."

CHORUS
Believe me when I tell you true,
Love cannot close its doors,
So long as you are true to me,
And I am "truly yours."

2.
When other lips breathe words of love
And make some promise true,
Then like some swift-wing'd messenger,
My love flies back to you.
Then am I happy, for I feel
Love crushes hearts by scores,
And leaves your's loving noe but me,
While I am--"truly yours."

(CHORUS)

3.
Though time in its untiring flight,
Teach others to forget,
There's one whose heart you taught to love,
Who fondly loves you yet.
Though I be sitting by your side,
Or off on foreign shores,
Morn, noon, or night, afar or near,
I still am--"truly yours."

(CHORUS)
