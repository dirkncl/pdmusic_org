1. O! merry row, O! merry row 
the bonnie bonnie Bark,
Bring back my Love to calm my woe,
Before the night grows dark.
My Donald wears a bonnet blue,
a bonnet blue, a bonet blue,
A snow-white rose upon it too,
A Highland Lad is he!
Then merry row, O! merry row
the bonnie bonnie Bark
O! merry row, O! merry row
and bring him safe to me.

2. As on the pebbly beach I stray'd,
Where rocks and shoals prevail,
I thus o'er heard a Lowland maid,
Her absent love bewail:
A Storm arose, the waves ran high,
the waves ran high, the waves ran high,
And dark and murky was the sky,
The wind did loudly roar,
But merry row'd O! merry row'd
the bonne bonnie bark,
O! merry row'd the bonnie bonnie Bark
and brought her Love on shore!
