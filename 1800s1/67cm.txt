1. I’ve wander’d thro’ the village, Tom,
  Along the Annie Lee;
To listen to the mocking bird,
  In the cottage by the sea;
The bobtail nag cant be beat,
  While coming thro’ the rye,
Let me kiss him for his mother’s sake,
  Says the spider to the fly;
We’ll rally ’round the flag boys,
  For Johnny stole the ham,
Let me kiss him for his mother’s sake,
  Hurrah for Uncle Sam. 

2. The Color’d Gal and Poor old Steve,
  Now swell our native song;
I’d offer thee this hand of mine,
  But take your time Miss Long;
I’m lonely since my mother died,
  Susanna don’t you cry,
We’re all a noddin thro’ the world,
  Then root you hog or die;
We’ll rally ’round the flag boys,
  For Johnny stole the ham,
Let me kiss him for his mother’s sake,
  Hurrah for Uncle Sam.

3. Hark! I hear an angel sing,
  Ah! daddy he’s struck ile,
We’re coming Father Abraham
  Along with Annie Lyle;
The song my mother used to sing,
  The wearing of the green,
The girl I left behind me,
  To day she’s sweet fifteen;
We’ll rally round the flag boys,
  For Johnny stole the ham,
Let me kiss him for his mother’s sake,
  Hurrah for Uncle Sam.

4. The nice young man and Fairy Bell
  Are swinging in the land,
The Captain with his whiskers,
  Has mother on the brain;
Oh! yes I hear an angel sing,
  Ah! daddy he’s struck ile.
We’re coming Father Abraham
  Along with Annie Lyle;
So rally round the flag boys,
  For Johnny stole the ham,
Yankee Doodle! Hail Columbia!
  Hurrah for Uncle Sam!
