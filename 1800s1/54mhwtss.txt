1. Oh, summer time will come and go,
Flow’rs will bloom tho’ now laid low,
But we one summer only know;
So let’s make hay while the sun shines.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let’s make hay! Let’s make hay!
Let’s make hay while the sun shines!
Let’s make hay! Let’s make hay!
Let’s make hay while the sun shines!

2. While the tide of health is flowing,
And pleasure ev’rywhere is growing,
Why take your scythe and be mowing;
And let’s make hay while the sun shines.

3. Do not think old Time is sleeping,
Tho’ he’s like the ivy creeping,
Still we’re safely in his keeping;
So let’s make hay while the sun shines.

4. Decrepid age will soon come o’er us,
Then no power can restore us,
Death alone makes up life’s chorus;
So let’s make while the sun shines.
