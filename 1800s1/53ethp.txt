1. When your daughter’s ta’en away 
And your heart is fill’d with care; 
When with Angels I shall pray 
For your peace and comfort here. 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free? 
Papa promise this to me. 

2. When your little Eva’s there,
Robed like those in spotless white;
And the conquering palm I bear.
Bless’d with love and Heaven’s light.
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free!
Papa promise this to me.

3. Wife and children send him near,
When forever I am gone;
Papa check the falling tear; 
Think upon my dying song.
Uncle Tom, Oh make him free!
Papa, Papa, do for me.
