1. Tis just a year ago today that I remember well.” 
I sat down by poor Nelly’s side 
And a story she did tell, 
’Twas ’bout a good old Darkey Jeff, 
That liv’d for many a year;
But now he’s dead and in his grave 
No trouble does he fear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For good old Jeff has gone to rest, 
We know that he is free.
Disturb him not but let him rest, 
Way down in Tennesee.

2. She took my arm, we walk’d along,
Into an open field,
And there she paus’d to breathe awhile
Then to his grave did steal,
She sat down by that little mound;
And softly whispered there,
Come to me Father ’tis thy child,
Then greatly dropped a tear.

3. But since that time how things have changed,
Poor Nelly that was my bride;
Is laid beneath the cold grave sod,
Down by her father’s side;
I planted there upon his grave,
The weeping willow tree,
I bathed its roots with many a tear,
That it might shelter me.
