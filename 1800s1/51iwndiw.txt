1. I would not die in Winter,
Dark Winter’s cheerless hour;
When naught is glad, and all is sad
Beneath its icy bow’r.
Methinks my thoughful death bed,
And sad and silent tomb,
Would have Spring’s light, not Winter’s night;
I’d not add gloom to gloom.
  Methinks my thoughtful death bed,
  And sad and silent tomb,
  Would have Spring’s light, not Winter’s night:
  I’d not add gloom to gloom.

2. But let me die in Spring time,
Bright, ever joyous Spring!
Let green trees wave around my grave
And flower’s their fragrance bring;
Let gentle zephyrs waft my soul
O’er death’s uncertain sea;
And when birds sing on flutt’ring wing,
Let that my requiem be!
  Let gentle zephyrs waft my soul
  O’er death’s uncertain sea;
  And when birds sing, on flutt’ring wing,
  Let that my requiem be!
