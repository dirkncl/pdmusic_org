1. We miss thee at home, yes! we miss thee,
Since the hour we bade thee adieu.
And pray’rs have encircled thy pathway,
From anxious hearts loving and true.
That the Savior would guide and protect thee,
As far from the lov’d ones you roam
And whisper whene’er thou wert saddened,
They miss thee, all miss thee, at home.

2. The shadows of ev.nning are falling,
O! where is the wand’rer now,
The breeze that floats lightly around me
Perchance may soon visit his brow,
O! bear on thy bosom a message
We’re watching, O! why wilt thou roam;
The heart has grown cold and dejected
For we miss thee, all miss thee at home.
