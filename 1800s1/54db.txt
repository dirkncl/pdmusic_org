1. I lov’d a little color’d girl, she liv’d in Tennesee.
She wasn’t much to any one, but all the world to me;
Her master used her very hard but mine be used me well,
And how I pitied this poor gal there’s none but me can tell.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I lov’d her long nor thought is wrong & she lov’d me in rerurn,
But she left one day and went away, my pretty Dilly Burn.

2. My heart grew sad, I could not work my master wondered why.
I told him how she left one day, and never said good bye.
’Twas then I learn’d from his dear tips, that Billy Dorn had been sold.
And how we sever’d had to be, for a paltry sum of gold.

3. Now after this, it was not long, my Dilly’s owner died,
When massa bought her, good kind soul, and gave her as my bride;
And now we’re happy in our cot, and massa’s pleased to see,
Now two fond hearts that truly love, tho black can happy be.
