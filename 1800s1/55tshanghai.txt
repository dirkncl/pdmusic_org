1. The Shanghai is a pretty bird, 
That wakes us in the morning, 
With “dulcet sweetness long drawnout” 
To tell us day is dawning, 

[REFRAIN sung after VERSEs 1-3]
Oh! there’s many a way to start mankind; 
To tell them day is dawning, 
But worst of all is Shanghai’s crow: 
Get up I tell you’is morning!

CHORUS 1-­3 [sung after each REFRAIN] 
Oh! there’s many a way to start mankind, 
To tell them day is dawning, 
But worst of all is Shanghai’s crow: 
Get up I tell you’is morning!

2. In Army and in Navy too,
The revielle is sounded,
And always in a good hotel,
A Chinese Gong is pounded.

3. The Milkman rings his little Bell,
A warning of the Kitchen,
And Charcoal dealers cry their coal
In notes not too bewitching.

4. The Iron Horse with noise and jar,
With whistle, din and rattle,
Cannot compare with notes on time,
Drawn by these feathered cattle.

CHORUS 4 [sung after the REFRAIN]
Yes! Shanghai beats them all for noise,
And in his tones of thunder,
Cries forty thousand times a day
“Who’ll feed me next I wonderrr!”
