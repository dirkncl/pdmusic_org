1. Speed our republic O Father on high!
Lead us in pathways of justice and right;
Rulers as well as the ruled, “One and all,” 
Girdle with virtue— the armor of might!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

CHORUS 1
Rulers as well as the ruled, “One and all,” 
Girdle with virtue the armor of might!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

2. Foremost in battle for Freedom to stand, 
We rush to arms when aroused by its call;
Still as of yore, when George Washington led, 
Thunders our war cry: We conquer or fall!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

CHORUS 2
Still as of yore, when George Washington led, 
Thunders our war cry: We conquer or fall!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

3. Faithful and honest to friend and to foe— 
Willing to die in humanity’s cause— 
Thus we defy all tyrannieal pow’r, 
While we contend for our Union and laws!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

CHORUS 3
Thus we defy all tyrannical pow’r, 
While we contend for our Union and laws!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

4. Rise up, proud eagle, rise up to the clouds, 
Spread thy broad wings o’er this fair western world!
Fling from thy beak our dear banner of old— 
Show that it still is for freedom unfurl’d!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!

CHORUS 4
Fling from thy beak one dear banner of old.
Show that it still is for freedom unfurl’d!
Hail! three times hail to our country and flag!
