1.
Yale College is a jolly home;
  Swe-de-le-wee-dum-bum,
We love it still, wher-e'er we roam,
  Swe-de-le-wee-dum-bum,
DUET.
The very songs we used to sing,
  Swe-de-le-we-tchu-hi-ra-sa,
'Mid memory's, echoes long shall ring,
  Swe-de-le-wee-dum-bum.

CHORUS
Litoria! Litoria!
  Swe-de-le-we-tchu-hi-ra-sa.
Litoria! Litoria!
  Swe-de-le-wee-dum-bum.

[Same format as above for below verses, each followed by a CHORUS.]
2.
As Freshman first we came to Yale,
  Examinations make us pale;
But when we reach our Senior year,
  Of such thinks we have lost our fear.

[NOTE: verses 3 thru 6 are too unreadable from the low
