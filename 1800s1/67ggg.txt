1. We are all grumblers here,
From the largest to the least,
No matter what our cheer,
Be it famine, be it feast,
For this world is very strange,
Let times be fair or foul,
No matter where we range,
It is grumble, grumble, growl,
We never are content,
But we frown and we scowl
And our breath is ever spent,
In a grumble and a growl!

2. Bright smiles are very rare.
Thankful faces scarcely seen.
Let our fate be e’er so fair.
We do nothing but complain.
Sometime a muttered curse,
Sometimes almost a howl,
Never better, always worse
And its grumble, grumble growl.
We never are contenty
But we frown and we scowl
And our breath is ever spent
In a grumble, grumble growl.

3. This is wrong, very wrong
To slight our blessings here.
I tell it now in song
To press it on you here.
Give thanks for what you have,
Always smile and never scowl
And speak in tones of love
’Stead of grumble, grumble growl.
Thus will we be content,
Always smile and never scowl
And our breath in love be spent
Not in grumble, grumble growl.
