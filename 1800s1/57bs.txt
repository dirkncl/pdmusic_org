1.
Chickling! why sing in the barnyard wide,
Say why! say why!
Call you the Bridegroom or the Bride,
Oh say! oh say!
"I call on Bridegroom, Bride,
But sing because 'tis in my hide,
Nor know, nor know thus why I'm singing."

2.
Pigling! you have it very fine,
Ah ha! oh say!
My little dumsey swine,
Oh say, oh say,
How nice you'll look in gravy
And from the spit salt cant save ye!
Ah then O wont there be a squealing!
