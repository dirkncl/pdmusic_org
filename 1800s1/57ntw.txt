1. Early in the morning as I was promenading, 
Thro’ the streets of New York city fair 
came a youthful maiden, Her heart with care o’er laden 
because she discover’d she had nothing to wear. 

Bonnets she had plenty Shawls to count by twenty 
but still her refrain As she walk’d the city fair 
was I’m tir’d  of this duster it puts me in a fluster 
I declare it’s too provoking that I’ve nothing to wear.

2. Silk and Satin flounces and Hoops of all dimensions 
had this dame of New York city fair 
soon the fashion changing Her wardrobe disarranging 
she’d cry I declare I have nothing to wear. 

3. Dear Papa’s complaining, he says there’s no restraining, 
Th’extravagance in dress of his Willilmina fair 
Then she’ll coax and flatter And ask him how his daughter, 
Would look perading thro’ the streets with nothing to wear.
