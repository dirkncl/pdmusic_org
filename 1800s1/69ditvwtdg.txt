1. I met her in the valley where the daisies grow,
I felt that I must love her, yes, if she would or no,
It was a happy day, full well, full well I know,
I met her in the valley where the daisies grow.
She was fair to me, as fair as fair can be,
No damsel yet was half so fair as she.
She vow’d that she’d be true to me
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The daisies oh! the daisies oh!
Down in the valley where the daisies grow,
It was a happy day full well I know,
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.

2. I woo’d her in the valley where the daisies grow
And where beside the streamlet the water lilies blow
It was a happy moment when first she let me know,
She lov°d me in the valley where the daisies grow.
Ah t’was joy to me, as heart was full of glee,
When she agreed my loving bride to be.
And vow’d that she’d be true to me
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.
