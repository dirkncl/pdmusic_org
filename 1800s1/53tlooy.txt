1. When summer flowersa are weaving 
There perfume wreaths in air, 
And the zephyr’s wings receiving 
The love gifts gently hear; 
Then memory’s spirit stealing, 
Lifts up the veil she wears. 
In all their bright revealing, 
The loved of other years.

2. When summer stars are  shining 
In the deep blue midnight sky, 
And their brilliant rays entwining, 
Weave coronals on high; 
When the fountain waves are singing 
In tones night only hears, 
Then sweet thoughts waken, bringing 
The loved of other years.

3. The flowers around me glowing, 
The midnight stars’ pure gleam, 
The fountain’s ceaseless flowing 
Recall life’s fondest dream 
When all is bright in heaven, 
And tranquil are the spheres, 
To thee sweet thoughts are given, 
The loved of other years.
