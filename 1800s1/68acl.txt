1. The rites were o’er the fading day,
Sent thro’ the slowly gath’ring gloom;
A quiv’ring dim uncertain ray:
To rest upon the outcast’s tomb,
There slept in that lone dreamless bed,
A weary homeless refugee;
And sire nor kindred came to shed:
A tear o’er Anna Carter Lee.

CHORUS 1 and 2.
Rest sweetly rest where night dew’s weep,
And stars keep silent watch o’er thee.
God giveth His beloved sleep,
Rest sweetly Anna Carter Lee.

2. The daughter of a rebel chief,
No treason clouds her spotless fame;
For to the last with bitter grief:
She mourn’d that traitor father’s shame
Mid scenes of blood and civil strife,
She kept unchang’d her fealty;
Her truth shall be her crown of life:
Brave loyal Anna Carter Lee.

3. An exile for her country’s love,
From earthly home and kindred driv’n;
The pitying Father from above:
Call’d back the wand’rer home to heav’n
By martyr’s blood pour’d out like rain,
Is earth baptis’d at freedom’s call;
None suffer for the truth in vain:
God crowns His faithful when they fall.

CHORUS 3.
In triumph were oh sorely tried.
A martyr’s crown prepared for thee.
For ever shall thy fame abide,
Immortal Anna Carter Lee.
