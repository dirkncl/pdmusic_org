1. Merrily swinging on briar and weed, 
Near in the nest of his little dame; 
Over the mountainside or mead, 
Robert of Lincoln is telling his name:

DUET
Bob-o値ink, bob-o'link, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Snug and safe in that nest of ours, 
Hidden among the summer flowers. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

2. Robert of Lincoln is gaily drest, 
Wearing a bright black wedding coat. 
White are his shoulders and white his crest 
Hear him call in his merry note. 

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Look! what a nice new coat is mine, 
Sure there was never a bird so fine. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

3. Robert of Lincoln痴 Quaker wife, 
Pretty and quiet with plain brown wings 
Passing at home a patient life, 
Broods in the grass while her husband sings

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Brood, kind creature you need not fear 
Thieves and robbers while I am here. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

4. Modest and shy as a nun is she, 
One weak chirp is her only note. 
Braggart and prince of braggarts is he 
Pouring boasts from his little throat. 

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Never was I afraid of man; 
Catch me, cowardly knaves if you can. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

5. Six  white eggs on a bed of hay, 
Flecked with a purple, a pretty sight! 
There as the mother sits all day, 
Robert is singing with all his might

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bobo値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Nice good wife, that never goes out, 
Keeping house while I frolic about. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

6. Soon as the little ones chip the shell, 
Six wide mouths are open for food: 
Robert of Lincoln he stirs him well. 
Gathering seeds for the hungry brood. 

[SUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
This new life is likely to be 
Hard for a gay young fellow like me. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee.

7. Robert of Lincoln at length is made 
Sober with work and silent with care; 
Off is his holiday garment laid, 
Half forgotten that merry air,

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
Nobody knows but my mate and I, 
Where our nest and our nestlings lie, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee. 

8. Summer wanes: the children are grown; 
Fun and frolic no more he knows: 
Robert of Lincoln痴 a humdrum crone: 
Off he flies, and we sing as he goes. 

[DUET]
Bob-o値ink, bob-o値ink, 
Spink, spank, spink: 
When you can pipe that mercy old strain. 
Robert of Lincoln come back again. 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, 
chee, chee, chee, chee.
