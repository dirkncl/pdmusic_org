1. Oh why should we sigh 
For moments gone by, 
Or grieve for the joys that are past, 
Ah life seems so dear As old age draws near, 
When tolls the death knoll in the blast; 
Spring time passes by, 
Bright summer hours fly, 
Rich Autumn’s too lavish to last, 
Yet Winter may bring 
More pleasure than Spring, 
Then why do we mourn for the past?

2. Down life’s rapid tide 
In pleasure’s bark glide, 
With arms ’round some fairy form seek. 
Let Love fill the sail With balmiest gale, 
And Hope wave his torch from the mast; 
Then Spring may pass by, 
The Summer hours fly, 
Rich ask we proud Autumn to last; 
The present is ours, 
We’ll gather the flow’rs 
And never lament for the past.
