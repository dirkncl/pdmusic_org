1.
There was a fiddler and he wore a wig
wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy weedle
weedle, weedle
He saved up his money and he bought a pig
Tweedle, tweedle, tweedle, tweedle,
tweelde, tweedle, tweedle.

2.
He tun-ed his fiddle and he play'd a jig
jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy joodle
joodle, joodle
Which very much delighted this funny little pig
Grinny, grinny, grinny, grinny,
greedle, greedle, greedle.
