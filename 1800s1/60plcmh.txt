1.
Pretty lady, cross my hand
With a shining kit of gold;
What the glitt'ring stars fore tell,
That I truly will unfold,
The stars are shining now,
But they will not always shine,
And there's one that breathe a vow,
That will not be always thine;
On thy palm the lines of truth,
Stretches soft and broad and clear,
But 'tis cross'd by so much ruth--
Pretty lady, stat that tear!

2.
Life's line is dimm'd by care,
Sorrow dark before thee lies;
He who should thy sorrow share,
"Is here" a voice replies.
"Now false prophet, hence depart!
My life, my love, recover
Could that Gipsy's fateful art
Make you doubt your faithful lover!
Stars may pale and clouds may rise,
Yet the sun is bright above!
And the tears may dim your eyes,
Still they'll rest on those you love!"
