1. The daystar of freedom first dawning,
Shone clear thro’ its mantle of blue,
Bright streaks from the flash of the morning,
Led onward the brave and the true;
’Till victory peal’d an hosanna,
And crown’d with the glory of Mars,
The blue of that bright beaming banner,
Bedeck’d with the stripes and the stars.
  The blue of that bright beaming banner,
  Bedeck’d with the stripes and the stars.
    The blue of that bright beaming banner.
    Bedeck’d with the stripes and the stars.

2. Now her sons with millions united,
Have plac’d the bight colors on high,
And the torch that freedom first lighted,
Is the beacon of hope in the sky.
Whereever its emblems are flowing,
’Tis kiss’d with a nation’s huzzahs,
The plaudits of millions are glowing,
Around our bright stripes and our stars.
  The plaudits of millions are glowing,
  Around our bright sripes and our stars.
    The plaudits of millions are glowing,
    Around our bright sripes and our stars.

3. Our ranks like our stars still increasing,
As time waves the flag o’er our land,
With the plaudits of freemen unceasing,
United as brothers we stand.
United Americans ever,
We’ll clothe our bright flag with huzzas;
No hand shall deface thee, forever,
Or blotout the stripes and the stars.
  No hand shall deface thee, forever.
  Or blotout the stripes and the stars.
    No hand shall deface thee, forever,
    Or blotout the stripes and the stars.
