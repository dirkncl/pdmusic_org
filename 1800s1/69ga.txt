See! the pearly gates are op’ning, 
Angels wait my fleeting breath, 
And these shadows stealing slowly 
Must, I know, bw those of death. 
Clasp my hand still closer dur ing, 
’Tis the last night of your life! 
For tomorrow I shall never answer 
when you call me wife. 
There’s no shadow on the portal 
Leading to my heav’nly home; 
Christ has promis’d life immortal, 
And ’tis He that bids me come. 
Call our children to my bedside, 
My last blessing let them keep; 
But they’re sleeping, do not wake them, 
Soon enough, they’ll learn to weep. 
Tell them often of their Mother,  
Kiss them for me when they wake, 
Lead them gently in life’s pathway, 
Love them only for my sake. 
Fare thee well! Fare thee well! 
Faint not, Faint not ’neath the chas’ning rod. 
Fare thee well! Fare thee well! 
Faint not, Faint not ’neath the chast’ning rod. 
Throw your strong arms ’round our children, 
Keep them close to thee and God! 
Keep them close to thee and God! 
Farewell! Fare thee well!
