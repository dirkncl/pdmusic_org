1. I知 a pickaninny nig,
I am some what on a jig.
I知 a fancy little coon, and I doesn稚 care a fig
I can beat old uncle Snow, de best way he can go
I will clean de whole caboodle, den ye peoples watch my toe

2. Den open up your eyes, and watch me do a jig.
I know I値l please you all in de pickaninny nig.
I will try to please you all with this my ratling jig
I値l tear myself to pieces, I知 the pickaninny nig.

3. I can plunk de old banjo, in a way dat isnt slow
I can play de old jaw bone, and can use de fiddlebow
Oh! I feel so drefful sprisce, dat I値l turn myself aloose
And go in for a fracus, kase I痴e sound upon de goose.

[Refrain]
How a scientific moke, never need to be dead broke.
He値l never need be hungry, never want for drink or smoke.
Learn to cut a pigeon wing, gib you foot a little fling
And sail in Old Persimmons, you池e a Pickaninny King.
