1. At eve I pace the whiten’d sands.
I wipe my  hair with nervous hands,
So thick with dew the shining bands,
I sigh, I moan oh wearily
For many,  many leagues of sea
Now lie beween my love and me!
  For many,  many leagues of sea
  Now lie beween my love and me!

2. His lips rain’d kisses on my hair,
He left me standing tumbling there;
He said in words, so soft so fair,
I will come back, come back to thee
Though many, many leagues of sea
May lie between my love and me!
  Though many, many leagues of sea
  May lie between my love and me!

3. Oh say not that I wait in vain!
That others watch’d with throbbing brain
For truant ones who never came,
So false to me, he could not be
Though many, many leagues of sea
Do lie between my love and me!
  Though many, many leagues of sea
  Do lie between my love and me!
