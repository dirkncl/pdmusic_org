1. Tramp, tramp, tramp,
With ever unbroken tread
March the Invincible Guards
With only the drums ahead
With only the drums ahead
March the Invincible Guards
With only the drums ahead.
With only the drums ahead.
tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
March the Invincible Guards
With only the drums ahead
tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
The bugle may do for a charge
When cavalry sweeps o’er the field.
But to the drum march of the Guards.
The firmest of foes must yield,
To the drum march of the Guards.
The firmest of foes must yield.
The firmest of foes must yield.
Hurrah!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Tramp, tramp, tramp,
With the rolling drums ahead.
The Guards will march where duty calls wtih ever unfalt’ring tread.
The Guards will march where duty calls with ever unfalt’ring tread.
The Guards, will march where duty calls the Guards,
will march, with ever unfalt’ring tread. Hurrah!

2. Tramp, tramp, tramp,
Blow the winds ever so drear,
March the invincible Guards,
With never a thought of fear;—
With never a thought of fear
March the invincible guards
With never a thought of fear
With never a thought of fear
March the invincible guards
With never a thought of fear
tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
Oh pride is a glorious thing
When honor has given it birth!
Then hark! the drum march of the guards,
Over the trembling earth!
Hark! the drum march of the guards
Over the trembling earth
Over the trembling earth Hurrah!

3. Tramp, tramp, tramp,
Over the frozen snow—
The pride of the matchless guards,
Can only a soldier know!—
Can only a soldier know
The pride of the matchless guards
Can only a soldier know
The pride of the matchless guards
The pride of the matchless guards
Can only a soldier know
tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.
It is not alone for applause,
For ever a bulwark they stand,
The foremost to fight for our laws,
To die in defence of our land!
Foremost to fight for our laws
To die in defence of our land
To die in defence of our land
Hurrah!
