1. 
Once on a time old Johnny Bull, 
  Flew in a raging grandee, 
And in derision made a tune 
  Call’d “Yankee doodle dandy.” 

[REFRAIN]
“Yankee doodle” these are facts— 
  Yankee doodle dandy. 
My son of wax, your tea I’ll tax— 
  Yankee doodle dandy.”

2. 
John sent the tea from o’er the sea
  With heavy duties rated;
But whether byson or boben,
  I never heard it stated.
[Then Jonathan to pout began—
  He laid a strong embargo—
“I’ll drink no tea, by Jove!” so he
  Threw overboard the cargo.
Then Johnny sent a regiment.
  Big words and looks to bandy,
Whose martial band, when near the land.
  Play’d “Yankee doodle dandy.”]

[REFRAIN 2]
“Yankee doodle”— keep it up!
  “Yanlee doodle dandy!”
I’ll poison with a tax your cup.
  “Yankee doodle dandy.”]

3. 
A long war then they had, in which
  John was at last defeated—
And “Yankee doodle” was the march
  To which his troops retreated.
[Cute Jonathan, to see them fly,
  Could not restrain his laughter;
“That tune,” said he, “suits to a T.
  I’ll sing it ever after.”
Old Johnny’s face, to his disgrace,
  Was flush’d with beer and brandy.
E’en while he swore, to sing no more
  This “Yankee doodle dandy.”]

[REFRAIN 3]
“Yankee doodle”— ho! ho! ho!
  “Yankee doodle dandy.”
“We kept the tune, but not the foe.
  “Yankee doodle dandy!”

4. 
I’ve told you now the origin
  Of this most lively ditty,
Which Johnny Bull dislikes as “dull
  And stupid!”— what a pity!
[With “Hail Columbia!” it is sung,
  In chorus full and hearty—
On land and main, we breathe the strain,
  John made for his teaparty.
No matter how we rhyme the words,
  The music speaks them handy.
And where’s the fair can’t sing the air,
  Of “Yankee doodle dandy!”]

[REFRAIN 4]
“Yankee doodle”— firm and true—
  “Yankee doodle dandy.”
“Yankee doodle, doodle doo;”
  “Yankee doodle dandy.”
