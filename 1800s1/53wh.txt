1. Oh! none can tell but those who've roved,
Some bleak, some desert waste afar,
Apart from all he dearly loved,
How sad and drear life's moments are;
But none that heav'nly bliss can feel,
Save those who thus are forced to roam,
A few kind accents may reveal,
From lips that bid us "Welcome Home"
  From lips that bid us "Welcome Home".

2. I've sat within the stranger's door,
And alien lips spoke kindly too,
They but reminded me the more
My own dear native land, of you;
A stranger's welcome's ever dear,
We prize it when afar we roam,
And almost fancy that we hear
The voice that bids us "Welcome Home"
  The voice that bids us "Welcome Home".

3. The silv'ry brook goes murmm'ring by;
The wand'ring wind hath pleasant tone;
The lark he carols in the sky;
All nature music's pow'r must own;
But there's a music far more dear
That greets us when we cease to roam,
When sweetly falls upon the ear,
The words that bid us "Welcome Home"
  The words that bid us "Welcome Home".
