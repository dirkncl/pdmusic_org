1. OLD TIMES, Old Times, those good old times!
When I was young and free;
I heard the tuneful village chimes,
Down by the willow tree,
My Corie dear beside me
With her hand clasp.d in mine,
A heart at rest within my breast,
In boyhood’s happy prime.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sing! sing! and drown all grief and pain,
For no we’ll never, never see,
Such GOOD OLD TIMES again.

2. And sure my home is nothing chang’d,
The birds are singing still,
The flow’rs are sringing where we rang’d,
Down by the “Old Corn Mill.”
The willow waving o’er me,
Still sweetly shades my frame;
But sleeping is my Corie,
And I am not the same.

3. Oh, come again ye good old times,
Sweet, sunny fresh and clear,
And let me hear those village chimes:
And see my Corie dear;
If I could cry for ever,
My tears would flow in vain,
My heart from Hope must sever;—
They’ll never come again.
