"Mollie Graem" (1868)
Song with Chorus
Words and Music
by J[ohn]. H[ugh]. McNaughton [1829-1891]

Standing by my lowly door,
  Where we steed in happy yore,
In the snow I write thy name;
                   Mollie Graem!

Then I watch the melting snow
  Vanish like the long ago--
And I mourn thy vanished name,
                   Mollie Graem!

1. Standing by my lowly door,
Where we stood in happy yore,
In the snow I write thy name:
Mol lie— Mollie Graem.
Then I watch the melting snow,
Vanish like the long ago,
And I mourn thy vanish’d name—
Mollie— Molie Graem!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sweet as rose in Eden set,
With the tears of angels wet,
Mine will bloom in Heaven yet—
Mollie, Mollie Graem!

2. When the Spring shall come again,
Shall I seek for thee in vain—
Waiting in the daisied lane,
Mollie— Mollie Graem!
Like the bird its wounded mate,
Long, ah, long I’ll weary wait,
Watching by the meadow gate,
Mollie— Mollie Graem!

3. Cold the world is now to me,
(Once it smiled so tenderly!)
Cold the blast blows over thee,
Mollie— Mollie Graem!
From the rose the blossom’s fled,
Leaves are falling, wither’d, dead,
Drifting o’er thy quiet bed,
Mollie— Mollie Graem!
