1. When the Monarch’s of the forest.
Perish ’neath the lightning scath,
And the crushing of the whirlwind,
In its wild resistless wrath,
Tender shoots in beauty springing,
Soon conceal each broken stem,
And renew in time’s perfection,
Leafy branch and Diadem,
  And renew in time’s perfection,
  Leafy branch and Diadem.

2. Thus around our fallen heroes,
Stricken in their pride of place,
On the gory field of battle,
Cluster scions of their Race,
From each lowly grave uprising,
From each lone dismantled hearth,
Spring these peerless perfect pledges,
Of the nation’s newer birth,
  Spring these peerless perdect pledges,
  Of the nation’s newer birth.

3. Over these the hand of mercy,
Fain would stretch the wand of power,
For the storm that spares the Sapling,
Strikes to death the human flower,
Shielded from the sweeping tempest,
Fostered by your household fires,
These the Orphans of the Nation,
Shall bear witness of their Sires,
  These the Orphans of the Nation,
  Shall bear wit.ness of their Sires.
