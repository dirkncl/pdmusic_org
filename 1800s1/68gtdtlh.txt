1. We are marching with banners flying,
Hear the cry of vict’ry sounding far and wide,
Rally round him our noble hero,
Generral Grant the nation’s pride;
Who has crown’d our country’s story
With the purest wreath of glory,
Bold and fearless in every danger,
Noble Grant oh! cheer him boys Hurrah!

CHORUS 1-3.
We are marching our banners flying,
Hear the cry of vict’ry sounding far and wide
To the ranks boys be up and doing
Vote for Grant our Chieftain and our pride.

2. Swell the chorus, the mighty chorus
Over hill and mountain, let the echo fly,
Grant and Colfax shall be our watchword,
Let the Union’s voice reply.
Gentle freedom now behold him
With the starry pinions fold him;
Grant the daring the lion hearted
He shall lead us cheer him boys Hurrah!

3. Gallant soldiers, can you forget him,
Think of all your trophies on the Battle plain;
Richmond conquest and her surrender,
Let it rouse you once again.
Grant and Colfax still resounding
O’er the East and West rebounding,
Lift our standar’d and shout exulting
Hail! to Grant oh! cheer him boys Hurrah!
