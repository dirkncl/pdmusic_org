1.
Hail Columbia, valiant land,
Where foreign foe cannot withstand!
Mark the domestic traitor band,
Mark the domestic traitor band,
Like bucaniers, for plunder join,
Then justice, right, and truth profane;
With fiend skill— infernal power—
They waste, destroy, or else devour;
The infant’s sahreik, the mother’s wail,
To stay the sots cannot prevail.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Teach the tyrants, let them know,
Lay the fell usurpers low;
No more may they upon us foist
False colors they so proudly hoist.

2.
Where holy light, of heaven born,
Beamed full bright o’er freedom’s morn;
Arouse the Promethean fire,
Arouse the Promethean fire,
Emit along th’electric chain,
From torrid zone to tem’rate Maine,
Through livid gleaming, spendor dark,
Let freemen see, and feed the spark,
And ruthless despots shall relent,
Or hallowed blood again be spent.

3.
Awake, ye drowsy lookerson,
Arise! ere all that’s dear be gone:
Arouse the latent spark of fire,
Arouse the latent spark of fire.
Our sister’s fall, the demon prey;
And cold in death our offspring lay:
Where parties join, for plunder, pelf,
And worship only gold and self;
While fain “they make believe” they pray,
They rob with grace and piety.

4.
Ye sceptics of these latter days,
Who have no faith unless it pays;
Believe, and own there is a God;
Believ, and own there is a God:
He, though slain, yet is the people’s—
He’s high above the pride of steeples!
The “den of thievs,” (not his forsooth),
United slew that God of Truth;
The sponge of gall they still present,
For ever pray, but ne’er repent.
