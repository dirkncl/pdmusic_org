1. Old Jessy once was young like us,
Could hoe de cotton well.
But now he’s passing away from us
Like de dewdrop on de hill.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Den pity poor old Jessy
And wipe de teardrop from your eye,
For Jessy’s gwine to leave us soon
And in de ground to lie.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den pity poor old Jessy
And wipe de teardrop from your eye,
For Jessy’s gwine to leave us soon
And in de ground to lie.

2. Old Jessy’s hair is gray and long
Like de moss upon the tree
And his teeth drop out ob de old jaw bone
Oh soon he will be free.

3. Oh Jessy can’t play de banjo
His fingers are stiff and sore
Dey tremble so de bones do creek
He’ll play no nebber more.

4. He used to go out in de oyster boat
Far, far away from shore
But he will nebber go out again,
Echo answers nebber more.
