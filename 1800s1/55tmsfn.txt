1.
Tell me some fond name, some word all apart,
Whereby to murmur of thee to my heart,
For the name that the world rings with seemeth to me,
Too proud for the sweet thoughts I cherish for thee.
Knoweth them not how the rude forest child
Gives a name to his dear ones far, far in the wild,
Which only he breathes to the Great Spirit's ear
A name which no mortal ever may hear.

2.
Tell me some sweet name, told only to me,
Whereby murmur to heaven of thee;
For the name that the world sings with every where,
Seems too proud for the wishes I breath in my prayer,
Tell me some fond name, sweet word apart,
Whereby to whisper of thee to my heart.
Tell me some name only known unto me,
Whereby to murmur to heaven of thee.
