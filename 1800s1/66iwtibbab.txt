1. I wish that I’d been born a boy,*
  I really do Indeed.
If just to show some young man now,
  In life how to succeed.
I wouldn’t wish to be a fop,
  For they’re conceit immense;
I’d wish to be a young man grown,
  Possess’d of common sense.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I wish that I’d been born a boy.
  I really do indeed.
If just to show some young man now,
  In life how to succeed.

2. I wouldn’t wear a false moustache,
  Upon my upper lip.
If one at all, I’d grow my own,
  To be in fashion’s tip:
I wouldn’t wear a pin of brass,
  ’Pon my shirt bosom, no,
I’d sport the gold with diamonds, real,
  Off should, I want to show.

3. I wouldn’t scent myself with musk,
  That girls might think me sweet.
I wouldn’t, like some young men ’round,
  My washerwoman cheet,
Because a young Miss glanced at me,
  I’d not imagine, so;
That she had fallen, straight in love,
  Or wish’d me for a bean.

4. I wouldn’t look to,— no, no, no,
  My Mammy for support,
Like many young girls that I know
  Who here and there resort,
I’d be a man, and not a mouse
  And go to work at once,
I’d, in my pockets have some cash
  And, make use of my sconce.

5. I wouldn’t spout my mother’s watch,
  To show off at a Ball;
I wouldn’t wear a great fob chain,
  Had I no watch at all;
I wouldn’t run a great long bill
  Be it, for what it may,
’Fore I show’d out in broadcloth clothers,
  I would my tailor pay.

6. I wouldn’t strike a woman, no,
  He’s not a man, who would
Or take advantage of old age,—
  But aid such, if I could,
Yes, if I had been born a boy
  All insults I’d repel,
And there’s some fellows that I know
  I’d like to thrash right well.
