1. The wild winds sigh o’er the Ocean wave,
  A requiem sad for thee,
And strew the sea foam on thy grave,
  Poor lost Harry Lee.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sadly they sigh for thee:
“He lies in the dark blue sea.’
But the winds blowing high,
And the sea birds cry,
Can ne’er wake Harry Lee.

2. More nobly he stood upon that deck,
  Than hero of battles won,
As sinking with the peopled wreck,
  He fired the minute gun,

3. No marble tablet shall impart,
  The story of his praise,
But mem’ry within many a heart,
  A monument shall raise,

4. Those standing on the shore of time,
  Shall hear from off the sea,
The spirit hear from off the sea,
  The spirit voices sweetly chime,
