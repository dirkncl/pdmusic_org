1.
Way down in Louisiana,
  Not many years ago,
There liv'd a color'd gemblum,
  His name was Pompy Snow,
He play'd upon de banjo
  And on de tambourine,
And for rattling of the bones he was
  The greatest ever seen
In the Louisiana lowlands lowlands low,
In the Louisiana lowlands low.

CHORUS
In the Louisiana lowlands, lowlands low,
In the Louisiana lowlands low.

2.
One night old Pompy started off,
  To play for Ceasar Clum,
But afore he went he fortified,
  With a good stout glass of rum;
When on the road he thought he saw
  A darkey, tall and grim,
So Pompy laid the banjo down
  Tto break the darkey's shin;
In the Louisiana lowlands lowlands low,
In the Louisiana lowlands low.

(CHORUS)

3.
Says he, old chap, just move along
  Or else I'll spoil your face,
But dis darkey didn't seem to move
  From out his hiding place,
So drawing back, he crooked his head,
  And down at him cachunk,
But Pompy made a sad mistake, for
  'Twas nothing but a stump,
In the Louisiana lowlands lowlands low,
In the Louisiana lowlands low.

(CHORUS)

4.
The stump it proved a little hard,
  Too hard for Pompy's wool,
For when he struck, the hickory knot,
  Went thru' the darkey's skull;
They found his banjo by his side,
  And Pompy lying dead,

[SPOKEN]---And Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
the first time up a record that it was ever known
of a darkey's ever coming to his death]

  By de breaking of his head.
And dey buried him in the lowlands, lowlands low,
In the Louisiana lowlands low.

(CHORUS)
