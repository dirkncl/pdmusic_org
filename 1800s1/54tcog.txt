1.
SOLO
In the hall, bedecked with garlands, doth it not the soul entrance,
When the joyous Ritornella is exciting all the dance?
Dost thou love to hear the rustling of the loftly poplar trees,
In the shady grove, low whisp’ring to the Evening’s gentle breeze?
CHORUS
In the shady grove, low whisp’ring to the Evening’s gentle breeze?

[sung after each VERSE]
SOLO
No, no,
CHORUS
no, no,
SOLO
Then say what dost thou love?
Nor the singing of the linnet?
Nor the murmur of the stream?
Nor the glad note of the woodlark?
Nor the charm of love’s fond dream?
No! ’tis the chink of gold you love!
Yes! ’tis the chink of gold you love! Ah!

2.
SOLO
Dost thou love the midnight revel, where gay Bacchus reigns around,
And each worldly care and sorrow in the jovial bowl be drown’d?
Dost thou love to hear soft voices with the organ’s pealing blend,
Which like fragrant breathing perfumes unto Heav’n with pray’rs ascend?
CHORUS
Which like fragrant breathing perfumes unto Heav’n with pray’rs ascend?
