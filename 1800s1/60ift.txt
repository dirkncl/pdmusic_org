I’ll follow thee,
I’ll follow thee where ever thou may’st go
To the land, the land of burning sunshine
Or the realm of winter snow..
For the world is not as boundless
As a woman’s heart can be
So where ever thou may’st wander
I will follow, follow thee!
I’ll follow, follow, follow thee!
Where ever thou may’st go,
I’ll follow, follow, follow thee!
I’ll follow thee.
I’ll follow thee.
I’ll follow thee.
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee.
I’ll follow thee.
Whatever thou may’st prize,
Of fame or grandeur to be won
Beneath the alien skies.

For the world owns no such treasure
As a faithful heart can be.
Then where ever thou may’st wander
I will follow thee.
I’ll follow, follow, follow thee!
Where ever thou may’st go
I’ll follow, follow, follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee, I’ll follow thee!
I’ll follow thee, I’ll follow thee,
I’ll follow thee, I’'ll follow thee,
I’ll follow thee, I’ll follow, follow thee!
