1.
Bright "Star of Love," shine on,
The sunbeams' gold is gone,
The rising moon is still,
Out o'er the sea,
With pearls of dew, come night!
And thou, my soul's delight
In whom all joys unite,
Fly love with me,
Bright Star of Love we go,
Where wild waves darkly flow,
And winter's winds may blow,
In night and storm,
Yet by thy side most dear!
Thy star of love would cheer,
And gloom bring naught of fear
When near thy form.
And gloom bring naught of fear
When near thy form.
Bright Star of Love shine on.

2.
Bright Star of Love! I mark
In gloom thy waiting [barque?],
With thee there is no dark
By sea or land
Bright Star of Love thy smile,
Lights ev'ry lonely route,
To hope's bright happy isle
Bound hand in hand
Come! come at death of day,
By yonder [lovestar's?] ray,
And dark altho' the way,
We'll never part,
Earth's gem divine, how bless'd;
To this fond bosom press'd
Sole star of beauty rest
Near, near my brest!
Sole star of beauty rest
Near, near my brest!
Bright Star of Love shine on.
