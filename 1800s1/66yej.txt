1.
Oh! de mighty deed am done and de Union battles won,
And de darkey gins to find just whar to go:
Massa Lincum's Proclamation saved dis great and glorious nation:
While it hustled old secession down below.
In Charleston ober dar
In Richmond ober here:
De Chivalry dey chuck'ld in dar sleebe.
But Grant he put em thro'
And so did Sherman too,
While dey told de darkies all to cut and leebe.
And dats just what dey wanted for to do.

2.
Oh! I've got de recollection bout de Alabama section,
When I used to pick de cotton whar it grow'd,
When old massa lick'd dis nigger 'case de pickins wasn't bigger
Tho' I always work'd de berry best I know'd.
But when de sojers come:
Oh! den I cut and run:
And jine de Union ranks ob Uncle Sam.
Tho' I could'nt read or write:
I soon learn'd how to fight
And I help to gain my freedom in de land.
And dats just what I wanted for to do.

3.
Oh! dars room enough for all--white and black and great and small,
In dis great and happy land ob Liberty:
I can work as well as fight: and I'll do whate'er is right;
If you'll only try and do the same by me.
We soon will understand
Our places in de land:
And could'nt hurt de country if we would.
And its plain enough to see:
Dat now we all are free
We would'nt hurt de country if we could.
Dats what we neber wanted for to do.
