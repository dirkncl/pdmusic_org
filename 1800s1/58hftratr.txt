1. For ships of all Nations a harbour
  On ev’ry broad river prepare.
They’ll bring us rich products of labour,
  And ours in return they shall share,
Abolishing space in his fleetness,
  The steam horse is bounding along,
Careering the highway to greatness,
  Then onward we cannot go wrong.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah for the Rail and the River,
  Great Britain’s renown they proclaim.
Her commerce shall flourish for ever,
  And wealth gild the crown of her fame.

2. With art and fair science to aid us,
  Success shall encircle our coast,
What  nature and these have now made us,
  A pledge for advancement we boast.
Strong Industry’s honest endeavour,
  Shall bear us triumphantly on,
High enterprise prompting us ever
  Until her best laurels be won.

3. With our Island resources most ample
  The Banner of Union unfurl’d,
Our merchants have set the example,
  How Free trade should bless the whole World,
Then let all our Docks be extended,
  Our Iron roads widely increased,
And the interest of Nations be blended,
  To live by the traffic of Peace.
