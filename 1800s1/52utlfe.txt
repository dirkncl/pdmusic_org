1.
“The sun arose in beauty,
The birds caroled their song;
Sweet flowers sent forth their fragrance,
And decked the verdant lawn.
But sad my heart was breaking,
No gleam of sunshine there,
All, all was drear and darkling,
No comfort, e’en in prayer.”

2.
“For ’twas the morn they laid you,
Dear Eva, in thy grave,
E’en now my heart is breaking,
O God, in pity save.
Thou knowest human weakness,
Thou knowest human woe;
O take me to those mansions
Where heavenly waters  flow.”

3.
“There, ’mid seraphic beings,
I’ll meet my darling one,
And join with her in singing
Amid that heavenly throng.
Forever and forever
Our swelling songs shall rise;—
O take me to those mansions
Far, far beyond the skies.”

4.
Again the sun in beauty
Arose in cloudless dawn;
Again sweet flowers in fragrance
Bloomed gaily o’er the lawn.
But Uncle Tom ne’er heeds them,
He’s joined the angel throng,
And strikes his harp immortal
To Eva’s heavenly song.
