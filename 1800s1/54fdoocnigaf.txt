1. Our country now is great and free,
  Few Days, few days,
And thus  shall it forever be,
  We know the way.
We’ll teach the hosts that gather here,
  Few Days, few days,
That we’ll protect what we hold dear,
  We know the way.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We’ll battle innovation,
Few day, few days,
And fight ’gainst usurpation
By a cunning foe,
For our guide is Freedom’s banner,
Few days, few days,
Our guide is Freedom’s banner,
We know the way.

2. The world shall see that we are true,
  Few days, few days,
And that we know a thing or two,
  We know the way.
As “Know Nothings” we’re hand in hand,
  Few days, few days,
Our countless throng shall fill the land,
  We know the way.

3. From East and West, from South and North,
  Few days, few days,
We’ll call our many legions forth.
  We know the way.
The freedom that our fathers won,
  Few days, few days,
Shall be defended by each son.
  We know the way.

4. Then shout, then shout o’er hill and plain,
  Few days, few days,
Our Union shall its rights maintain.
  We know the way.
We’ll guard, we’ll guard the ballotbox,
  Few days, few days,
From foreign wiles and treason shocks.
  We know the way.
