1. Some blest spirit doth inherit
Bright ethereal realms above;
And descending, hither wending,
Pours a gentle strain of love.

2. Oft in slumbers soothing numbers
Breathed in accents soft and clear,
Bring a feeling o’er me stealing
Of some guardian angel near.

3. Now ideal forms are real,
Wrought in fancy’s purest mould;
Sweetly blending, strains ascending
Ring from living harps of gold.

4. While declining stars are shining,
Pours the moon her silver beam;
Blissful bowers, golden flowers,
Gild each fairy winged dream.

5. Some blest spirit doth inherit
Bright eternal realms above;
And descending, hither wending,
Pours the gentle strain of love.
