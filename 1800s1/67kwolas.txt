1. Kneel where oiur loves are sleeping,
Dear ones loved in days gone by,
Here we bow in holy reverence,
Our bosoms heave the heartfelt sign.
They fell like brave men, true as steel,
And pour’d their blood like rain—.
We feel we owe them all we have,
And can but kneel and weep again.

CHORUS 1-2.
Kneel where our loves are sleeping,
They lost, but still were good and true,
Our fathers, brothers fell still fighting.
We weep, ’tis all that we can do.

2. Here we find our noble dead—
Their spirits soar’d to Him above,
Rest they now above His throne,
For God is mercy, God is love.
Then let us pray that we may live,
As pure and good as they have been,
That dying we may ask of Him,
To ope the gate and let us in.
