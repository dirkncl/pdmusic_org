1. Oh dont you remember pretty Etty Way,
Dat gentle form long since passed away,
A little slab of marble with Etty graved on top,
And a little mound of clay, marks the quiet spot.

CHORUS [sung TWICE after each VERSE]
Good bye boys I’m off for home
Far across de bay,
De whippoorwill will knell de death
De death of Etty Way.

2. Day layed her where de spring time comes,
Where mocking birds sing an bees do hum,
Her spirit like birds at eve has flown far away
To find a better home for gentle Etty Way.

3. Etty was so gentle kind and good to all,
She played de ole banjo dat hung upon de wall,
Etty’s voice was low and sweet like de little bird,
Dem soft and gentle tones dat I’ve so often heard.

4. De little cottage home is lonely and still,
Her warm dimpled cheek is cold and chill.
Well do I remember when warm was dat breast.
All’s silent and sad round the place whar she rest.
