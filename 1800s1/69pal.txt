1. As we travel the paths of this short checker’d life,
We encounter the gold with the dross,
From a child’s candy toy to a neat pretty wife,
There is much goes to “profit and loss;”
When a purchase we make, and think we have found
The real “simon pure” without gloss.
If it proves but a sham we can only turn round,
And change it to “profit and loss.”

CHORUS [sung by each VERSE]
Then don’t envy the rich or give heed to the proud,
For the brightest (and purest) of gold contains dross.
And at times when our fortunes are under a cloud,
Just change it to “profit and loss.”

2. O we’re quite prone to think as we’re gadding about,
That we’re never with good fortune blest,
But by having the patience and nerve to hold out,
We will stand a good chance with the rest;
There’s an adage that’s old, tho’ simple, ’tis true,
“A rolling stone gathers no moss,”
But with good pluck and honesty all our life through,
Now much goet to “profit and loss.”

3. As we each day are striving great riches to gain,
I’m afraid that we some times forget,
That we’re now very long on this earth to remain,
That we owe to the future a debt;
If when promptings to wrong are thrown in our way
We give them a disdaining toss,
I’m quite sure on the great final settlement day,
We’ll not have much to “profit and loss.”
