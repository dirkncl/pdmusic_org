"My Grandmother's Lesson" (1857)
by Artemas Nixon Johnson

1.
My Grandmother lived on yonder little green,
As fine old lady as ever seen,
She oftentimes taught and instructed me with care,
Of all false young men to beware;
Ti di um dum dum dum di-di-id-i-air,
Of all false young men to beware.

2.
And now my dear daughter don't you believe,
For they will fib and cunningly deceive,
They well cruelly deceive you before you are aware,
Then away goes poor old Grandma's care;
Ti di um dum dum dum di-di-id-i-air,
Then away goes poor old Grandma's care.

3.
The first welcome courting was honest young Green,
As fine a young gentlemen ever was seen,
But the words of Grandma so rand in my head,
I cound not attend to one word that he said;
Ti di um dum dum dum di-di-id-i-air,
I could not attend to one word that he said.

4.
The next who came courting was young farmer Grove,
With him I engaged in bonds of joyful love,
Such sweet and truthful love you need never be afraid,
For 'tis better to be married than to die an old maid;
Ti di um dum dum dum di-di-id-i-air,
For 'tis better to be married than to die an old maid.

5.
O dear what a fuss these old ladies make,
Thinks now I to myself there must be some mistake,
For if all the old ladies of young men had been afraid!
Why, Grandma herself would have died an old maid!
Ti di um dum dum dum di-di-id-i-air,
Why, Grandma herself would have died an old maid.
