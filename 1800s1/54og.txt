1.
Our Girls they are pretty, and gentle, and witty
As any the world ever knew;
Talk not about Spanish, Circassian and Danish,
Or Greeks ’neath their summer skies blue—
But give me our Lasses,
As fresh as the grass is,
When sprinkled with roses and dew
Our  Girls they are pretty and gentle and witty
As any the world ever knew.

CHORUS [overlapping voices; sung after each VERSE]

As any the world ever knew;
Our Girls they are pretty

2.
Each lip is a blossom, each fair swelling bosom,
As white as the high drifted snow;
With eyes softly flashing, like spring bubbles dashing
O’er hillrocks to valleys below.
All smiling with beauty, and doing their duty
Where shall we for lovelier go?
Our Girls they are pretty and gentle and witty
As any the world ever knew.

3.
O ours are the fairest, the sweetest and rarest,
The purest and fondest I see;
Their hearts are the truest, their eyes are the bluest,
Their spirits so noble and free;
O give me no other, true love, Sister, Mothther,
Our girls are the chosen for me.
Our girls they are pretty and gentle and witty,
As any the world ever knew.
