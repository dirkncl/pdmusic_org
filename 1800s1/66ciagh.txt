1. Where Potomac’s pearly waters,
  Softly kissed the dews of morn,
And the golden sunbeams shieth,
  Fairest landscapes to adorn,
Lay a young and gallant warrior,
  Far away from friends and love;
But around his form war gathered,
  Happy angels from above.

[CHORUS sung twice after each VERSE]
Gently, softly, Willie murmured,
“O that mother dear would come!”
But stern Death is fast approaching,
“Comrades, I am going home!”

2. How he closed his eyes in slumber,
  O, how soft and sweet that sleep,
As we gather’d ’round his pillow,
  Breaking hearts in sorrow weep;
But a smile o’erspreads his features,
  Smile of heav’nly light and love,
And we know that noble Willie,
  Soon would bloom in cpurts above.

3. Then as death’s approach drew nearer,
  He awoke from slumber sweet,
Called us all his loving brothers,
  Hopes that we in heav’n might meet.
He had nobly done his duty,
  He had waved our flag on high,
In the fiercest of the battle,
  And was now content to die.

4. Soon he saw our starry banner,
  Floating high in ether blue,
And his bosom swelled with rapture,—
  He had to the flag proved true
While the “ebom angel” lingered,
  Soon to touch with magic wand,
Willie’s feeble voice was ringing,
  For the emblem of our land!

5. ’Neath a mound on sunny hillside,
  They had laid his form to rest;
With his white arms gently folded
  O’er his still and lifeless breast;
There his words of love and friendship,—
  Tell my mother dear, to come!
I will meet you all in heaven,—
  Comrades, I am going home!
