1. Now Julius come and go with me, 
And see the new made bride. 
The prettiest gal by far around 
A sitting by me side; 
I told her when I left this morn, 
To have the supper early; 
The hoe cake ’taters and the corn, 
The rice and nice fresh barly, 
Then Julius come go home with me 
And drink a cup of tea. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ring the bell, oh ring the bell, 
oh ring the bell for me, 
Our supper will get cold my love, 
If you dont ring for tea.

2. I’d ax you all to come to tea
But the ’partments are too small.
I’ve only room for two or three.
We cannot seat you all.
Now Julius he’s a nice old chap
And eats but little ever.
And Fanny she will try and do
Her very best endeavour.
Then Julius come and go with me
And drink a cup of tea.

3. Oh since I’ve married that sweet gal
I feel so yound and fine.
I’ve left off drinking every thing
Except a little wine.
Now Julius is it time to go.
I know that Fanny’s waiting.
We’ve sung so much that we are tired
And our stomachs they want baiting.
Then Julius come and go with me
And drink a cup of tea.
