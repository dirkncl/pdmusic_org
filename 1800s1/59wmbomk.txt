1. I am going far  away, 
Where the summer breezes play 
To the Mississippi river I am going, 
I shall often bring to mind 
All the friends I leave behind 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Down in my Old Cabin Home, 
They are my sister and my brother, 
There shall I see My wife dear to me, 
And the graves of my father and my mother.

2. I shall wander many a mile, 
And bethink me all the while 
Of merry times that we have had together 
With my banjo on my knee. 
They will all come back to me 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home. 

3. I shall take my banjo there
In the summer evening air
Whre the darkeys are a dancing, and asinging,
When my head is growing gray
I shall love to sit and play
Away down in my Old Cabin Home.

4. I shall sit and sing alone
When the others all are gone
To work among the cotten by the river
And the little darkeyes near
Will come round me then to hear
Away down in the Old Cabin Home.
