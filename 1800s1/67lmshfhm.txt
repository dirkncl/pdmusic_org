1.
Let me spank him for his mother,
He is such a naughty boy,
He the baby tried to smother,
And he’s broken Fanny’s toy.
O! the doll I gave to Ellen
He has melted off the nose,
And there really is no telling,
To what length his mischief goes. 

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
So I’ll spank him for his mother,
For he’s such a tiresome brat,
And there really is no telling,
Now what mischief he is at.

2.
’Twas last night he put a cracker
’Neath his Aunt Jemina’s chair,
And he told me such a whopper
When I asked, how it came there,
Then when poor old Mrs. Toodles
Was just starting off by rail,
He tied her two fat poodles
Fast together by the tail!

3.
And it really is quit shocking
How one’s nerves he daily jars,
How he puts pins in one’s stockings,
And cayenne in one’s cigars,
You may guess that many another
Boyish trick he’s daily at,
So I’ll spank him for his mother,
As a tiresome little Brat.
