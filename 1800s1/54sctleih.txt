1. Childless, desolate this heart. 
Naught on earth is left to cherish, 
All is lost since we must part, 
Every hope and joy will perish. 
Eva! Eva! gentle daughter, 
Are those bright eyes veiled in death? 
That so fondly beam’d with goodness 
Upon all at parting breath. 
Art thou gone from me forever? 
Shall I never more behold thee? 
Bo’t of life, my heart’s fond treasure, 
What is now the world to me.

2. Lonely here and worn with sadness,
No loved child’s sweet voice I hear;
Life hath ceased to yield its gladness
Since without my little dear.
Eva! Eva! lovely daughter,
Are those young lips closed and cold
That so softly spoke of heaven?—
Emblem of an angel’s mould,
Picture of divine perfection.
Loved by all, enslaved and free,
Oh my heart and soul’s affection,
What is now the world to me.

3. Home is silent, dread, and drear.
Uncle Tom is seen to weep;
Topsy lingers near the bier,
Strewing roses at thy feet.
Eva! Eva! charming daughter,
Smile upon me from above;
Open those bright gates of pearl.
Bless me with thy spotless love;
Little angel thou art gone ‘there.’
Filled at last thy prophesy;
Farewell only child forever,
What is now the world to me.
