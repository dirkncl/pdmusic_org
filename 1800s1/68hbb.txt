1. The warcloud is rifted,— all hushed on the plain,
The thunders that never may waken again—
And its lin’ring shadows are fading away,
In the light which the stars of our banner display.

CHORUS 1-3.
Then hail, hail, hail beautiful banner,— 
float, float, float thou forever,—
Columbia will rise, the terror of Mars,
And bask in the light of thy beauteous stars.

2. Though darkness and gloom, may gather around,
The wak’ning in fancy the dread battle’s sound,
The flag of our Union in triumph shall wave
The glorious banner of the Noble and Brave.

3. Like the starlights above us, in heavenly blue,
Are cluster’d the stars of our country so true,
None destined by heav’n to fade or to fall,
While our banner shall wave at Liberty’s call.
