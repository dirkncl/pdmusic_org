1. Adolphus Pompey is my name, 
But that dont make no diff’rence, 
For as Mister William Shakespear’s says, 
A name’s of no ’signif’cance; 
I’m tall and slim, and just the thing, 
Just scrutinize my figure, 
And in a minute you will see, 
I’m an ’ristocratic nigger.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Keep your eyes up on him darks, 
The greatest Gent in town, 
He goes on tick, with a crooked stick, 
The darks have got him down.

2. Once on a time I liv’d down town,
With decent sort of fellows,
But now I’ve join’d the codfish club,
I mix with none but yellows,
Ev’n brother Bill I’m forc’d to cut,
Until he gets much bigger,
I must not ’sociate with him,
I’m an ’ristocratic nigger.

3. The other night we gave a ball,
A regular specificator,
When we went it many miles ahead,
Of things in human nature;
We had to cut mustaches off,
At this the ball de Vigor,
And no one could admittance gain,
But an ’ristocratic nigger.
