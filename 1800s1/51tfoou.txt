1. 
“A song for our banner,” 
The watchword recall 
Which gave the Republic her station; 
“United we stand– divided we fall!”– 
It made and preserves us a nation! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The union of lakes– the union of lands– 
The union of States none can sever–
The union of hearts– the union of hands– 
And the Flag of the Union for ever 
And ever! The Flag of our Union for ever!

2. 
What God in His wisdom and Mercy designed, 
And armed with His weapons of thunder, 
Not all the earth’s despots and factions combined, 
Have the power to conquer or sunder!
