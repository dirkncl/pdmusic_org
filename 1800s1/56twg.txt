1. Sad and lonely thro’ the world I wander
Far from friends and home,
Tho’ on them my heart will fondly ponder,
Onward still I roam;
Darling Lilla dear is calmly sleeping
Ne’er to wake again,
Where the silver dew is nightly weeping
In the willow glen.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Fare-thee-well my love forever
All life’s joys are o’er;
Thou art gone where these fond eyes can never,
Never see thee more.

2. She was fairer than the young May blossom
Budding into bloom,
And within her pure and artless bosom
Dwelt no shade of gloom;
Now among the flowers she is lying
Hid from mortal ken,
Where the mournful breeze is ever sighing
In the willow glen.

3. Side byside we wander’d o’er the heather
And each shady dell,
And our joy as thus we return’d together,
Tongue can never tell;
Now she’s gone where there is no more weeping
Far from haunts of men,
Soon I’ll follow where my Lilla’s sleeping
In the willow glen.
