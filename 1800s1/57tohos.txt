1.
Dashing thro' the snow,
In a one horse open sleigh,
O'er the hills we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bobtail ring,
Making spirits bright,
Oh what sport it is to ride
A sleighing song to night.

CHORUS
||: Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh. :||

2.
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seem'd his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And we, we got upsot.

(CHORUS)

3.
A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

(CHORUS)

4.
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls to night
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob tailed bay
Two forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead.

(CHORUS)
