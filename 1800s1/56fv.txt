1. 
I loved then long and dearly, Florence Vane;
My life’s bright dream, and early hath come again;
I renew, in my fond vision,
My heart’s dear pain,
My hopes, and thy derision,
Florence Vane, Florence Vane,
My hopes, and thy derision,
Florence Vane, Florence Vane,
The ruin lone and dreary,
The ruin old,
Where thou didst hark my story,
At even told,—
That spot— the hues Elysian
Of sky and plain—
I treasure in my vision.
Florence Vane, Florence Vane.

2. 
Thou wast lovelier than the roses in their prime;
Thy voice excell’d the closes
Of sweetest rhyme;
Thy heart was as a river
Without a main;
Would I had lov’d thee never,
Florence Vane, Florence Vane,
Would I had lov’d thee never,
Florence Vane, Florence Vane,
Florence Vane, Florence Vane.
