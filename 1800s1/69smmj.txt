1. One Sunday ofternood, it was a pleasant day,
I dress’d myself all in my best, to wander down Broadway;
I joined the happy throng that looked on birght and gay,
’Twas there I met sweet Molly Matilda Jane;
Oh! she was such a swell, She looked so sweet and charming.
Her roguerish eyes they fairly turned my brain,
Oh! She was such a belle, that without a moment’s warning
I fell in love with Molly Matilda Jane.

CHORUS 1 & 2 [sung after VERSEs 1 and 2]
Oh, was such a swell, She looked so sweet and charming,
Her roguish eyes they fairly turned my brain,
Oh, She was such a belle, that without a moments warning,
I fell in love with Molly Matilda Jane.

2. I stepped up to her side, and walked with her awhile,
And when I asked to see her home she did so sweetly smile,
Oh, such a happy hour I’ll never see again,
As that I passed with Moily Matilda Jane;
At first we talked of love, and then we spoke of marriage,
But her lofty notions almost turned my brain,
Oh, She said she’d marry no man that couldn’t keep a carriage
Expressly for his Molly Matilda Jame.

3. Of course this wouldn’t do for I was far from rich,
But soon I saw that her desired had got to such a pitch
That all that I could say was sure to be in vain,
So I said goodby to Molly Matilda Jane;
She went and wed a man that drove a stage on Broadway.
This way she took her dearest wish to gain,
So, She rides ev’ry day from the Park to Fulton Ferry,
While her husband drives for Molly Matilda Jane.

CHORUS 3 [sung after VERSE 3]
Oh, She is such a belle, They call her “Broadway Charmer,”
She’ always riding let it shine or rain,
Oh, When you take a stage just look over in the corner,
And there you’ll find sweet Molly Matilda Jane.
