1. Says Captain Robb to Farmer Cobb,
“Your Farm is very fine, Sir;
Please give me up your title deeds;
I claim it all as mine, Sir.”
“Pray, how can it be thine?” says Cobb;
I’m sure I never sold it;
“Twas left me by my father, Sir;
I only ought to hold it.”

2. Nay Cobb; the march of destiny—
’Tis strange you don’t perceive it—
Is sure to make it mine, some day;
I solemnly believe it.”
“But have you not already got
More land than you can till, Sir?
More rocks than you can ever blast?
More weeds than you can kill, Sir?

3. “Aye, Cobb, but something whispers me—
A sort of inspiration—
That I’ve a right to ev’ry farm
Not under cultivattion.
I’m of the ‘AngloSaxon race,’
A people known to fame, Sir;
But you— what right have you to land?
Who ever heard your name, Sir?

4. I deem you, Cobb, a lazy lout,
Poor, troddendown, and blind, Sir;
And if I take your useless land,
You ought to think it kind, Sir!
And with my scientific skill,
I set it down as true, Sir;
That I can gather from the farm
Full twice as much as you, Sir.

5. “To be explicit; ’Tis an age
Of freedom and progression;
No longer, doginmangerlike,
Can you retain possession.
The farm long since you forfeited,
Because you failed to till it;
To me it clearly now belongs,
Simply because— I will it.

6. “My logic if you disapprove,
Or fail of comprehending,
Or do not feel convinc’d that I
Your welfare am intending,
I’ve plenty more of arguments
To which I can resort, Sir;
Sixshooters, rifles, howieknives,
Will indicate the sort, Sir.

7. “So, prithee, Cobb, take my advice—
Make over your domains, Sir;
Or, sure as I am Captain Robb,
Will I— blow out your brains, Sir.”
Poor Cobb can only grind his teeth,
And grumble protestations
That might should be the rule of right,
Among enlightened nations.
