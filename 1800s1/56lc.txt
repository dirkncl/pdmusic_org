1. Bring de banjo— fetch de bones, 
Darkies listen to de tones, 
Sublimated sweet and clear, 
While I serenade my dear. 
Lubly Cynthie, you’re de dove 
Dat’t fill’d dis nigger’s heart wid lub, 
Now do just rise from your bed, 
And out ob de window shove your head. 

[CHORUS 1, sung twice]
Lubly Cynthie do now do, 
If you’ll lub me why I’ll lub you!

2. We played wid all our might and main,
When de clouds cum together, and fetched on a rain;
Sam Johnson he cried, now lookee here Bone,
Dis nigger dont stand on des wet stones.
Says I Mister Johnson you aint a guain to go,
Says he, I’m off to see Sally Snow—
De darkies all laughed, and Cynthie she cried
You dont get dis child for to be your bride.

[CHORUS 2, sung twice]
Lubly Cynthie dont say dat,
Or I’ll drown myself in possum fat.

3. Lubly Cynthie now listen to me,
My lub for you wont let me be,
Once more I beg look down and smile
On me, and then go res awhile;
Now lookee here Sambo, you cant cum to tea,
For I’se bound all de way to Tennesse,
Wid Bones, dats gained my lub, so go
You aint wanted here, make tracks, not slow.

[CHORUS 3, sung twice]
Cynthie, Cynthie I’se off, good night,
I’ll shoot dat Bones before daylight.
