1,
The old brown cow with the spot on her side,
  The pride of the old oak farm;
Sometimes she would caper and play with her horns,
But never would do any harm; no harm,
  But never would do any harm.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
To the old brown cow let the farmer boy toast,
  The pride of the old oak farm;
She died one day and we oft see her ghost,
Fear not, she will do you no harm;
  She never would do any harm.

2.
She was known in a circuit of thirty miles round,
  Both the old and the young knew her well;
And when they heard of the old cow's death,
Tears from their eyes then fell, then fell,
  Tears from their eyes then fell.

3.
While passing the pasture one moonlight night,
  Where for twenty long years she had fed,
Her ghost came up by the side of the fence,
And in tones like these she said, she said,
  In tones like these she said.
