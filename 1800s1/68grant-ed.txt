1. He comes the conq’ring Hero comes, 
A million hearts now greet him, 
He serv’d our country in her need, 
And we’ll go forth to meet him. 
The White-house opens wide its doors, 
To welcome Fame’s new comer, 
We’ll fight it out upon this line; 
Yes! if it takes all summer. 

CHORUS [aung after each verse]
Then rally boys, rally boys, 
The Union flag is planted; 
Our wish is law, and peace or war, 
We’re bound to have it GRANTed.

2. Ulysses brought Columbia out 
Dey shod thro’ Black-sea waters, 
And gave her up with glory crowned 
To countless seas and daughters, 
And now we’ll let him take the lead 
And help us to defend her, 
Demanding of her foemen, 
Unconditional surrender.

3. With Grant and Colfax at the head, 
We’re bound to save the nation; 
And plant her on the mountain top, 
The pride of all Creation, 
To end our cause in victoty 
We’ve but to state these bold facts 
Then boys, hurrah, shout loud and far, 
Hurrah for Grant and Colfax.
