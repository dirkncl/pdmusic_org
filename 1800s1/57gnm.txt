1.
  In a little white cottage
  Where the trees are evergreen,
And the climbing roses blossom by the door;
  I've often sat and listen'd
  To the music of the birds,
And the gentle voice of charming Nettie Moore.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
  O! I miss you Nettie Moore,
  And my happiness is o'er,
While a spirit sad around my heart has come;
  And the busy days are long,
  And the nights are lonely now,
For you've gone from our little cottage home.

2.
  Below us in the valley,
  On the Santee's dancing tide,
Of a summer eve I'd launch my open boat;
  And when the moon was rising,
  And the stars began to shine,
Down the river we so merrily would float.

3.
  One sunny morn in autumn
  Ere the dew had left the lawn,
Came a trader up from Louisiana-bay;
  Who gave to Master money
  And then shackl'd her with chains,
Then he took her off to work her life away.

4.
  Since that time the world is dreary,
  And I long from earth to rise,
And join the happy angels gone before;
  I never can be merry
  For my heart is full of woe,
And I'm pining for my pretty Nettie Moore.

5.
  You are gone lovely Nettie
  And my heart must surely break,
When the tears come no more into my eyes;
  But when weary life is past,
  I shall meet you once again,
In Heaven-- darling, up above the skies.
