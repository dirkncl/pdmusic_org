1. My Grandma lives on yonder little green, 
Fine old lady as ever was seen; 
She often cautioned me with care, 
Of all false young men to beware. 
 Timei time um tum time um pa ta. 
 Of all false young men to beware.

2. These false young men they flatter and deceive,
So my love you must not believe;
They’ll flatter, they’ll coax, ’till you are in their snare,
And away goes poor old grandma’s care.
 Timei time um tum time um pa ta.
 And away goes poor old grandma’s care.

3. The first came acourting was little Johny Green,
Fine young man as ever was seen;
But the words of my Grandma run in my head,
And I could not hear one word he said.
 Timei time um tum time um pa ta.
 And I could not hear one word he said.

4. The next came acourting was young Ellis Grove,
’Twas then we met with a joyous love;
With a joyous love I couldn’t be afraid.
You’d better get married than die an old maid.
 Timei time um tum time um pa ta.
 You’d better get married than die an old maid.

5. Thinks I to myself there’s some mistake,
What a fuss these old folks make;
If the boys and the girls had all been so fraid,
Then Grandma herself would have died an old maid.
 Timei time um tum time um pa ta.
 Then Grandma herself would have died an old maid.
