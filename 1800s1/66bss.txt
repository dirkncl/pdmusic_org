1. There is beauty on earth and beauty above.
  Mingled with stars in the cup of love,
With charming flowers fragrant and sweet,
  Their whispering voices on accent meet;
The stars unite with earth and the sky,
  In charms of beauty beaming on high
With sparkling eyes of woman fair—
  Soft and sweet as the Southern air,
  Soft and sweet as the Southern air.

2. There is not a star whose trembling ray,
  But kisses the flowers in early day,
While fleecy clouds encircle the sky,
  For the golden stars to sparkle by.
Flowers would wither but for the dew,
  That moistens their cusps— even drops so few,
And the sky grows dim in the evening air,
  If not for thee bright star so fair.
  If not for thee bright star so fair.
