"Let Me Kiss Him for His Mother" (1859)
Written by John P. Ordway
Composed by Luther Orlanda Emerson

The verses of this song ballad were suggested
by a touching incident which is said to have
occurred at New Orleans during the dreadful
fever season. A young man, who had died there,
lonely and a stranger, was about to be carried
to the grave when a lady passed to the coffin
and pressed her lips to his forehead, saying,
"Let me kiss him for his mother."

1.
Let me kiss him for his mother,
  Let me kiss his youthful brow;
I will love him for his mother,
  And seek her blessing now.
Kind friends have sooth'd his pillow,
  Have watch'd his ev'ry care;
Beneath the weeping willow,
  O lay him gently there.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sleep, dearest, sleep,
I love you as a brother,
Kind friends around you weep,
I've kiss'd you for your mother.

2.
Let me kiss his for his mother,
  What tho' left a stranger here;
She has him as none other,
  I feel her blessing near.
Tho' cold that form lies sleeping,
  He wears an angel's crown;
Dear friends around are weeping,
  O lay him gently down.

3.
Let me kiss him for his mother,
  Or perchance a sister dear;
If a father or a brother,
  I feel their blessing here.
Then kiss him for his mother,
  'Twill soothe her after years;
Farewell, dear stranger brother,
  Our requiem our tears.
