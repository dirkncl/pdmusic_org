1.
Oh! Samuel Johnsing is a man
  of color you all know;
And when among the color'd galls,
  He is the dandy beau;
His hair is always dress'd so nice,
  He always looks so clean,
And when he 'sembles with the crowd,
  His like was never seen.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dah da da da
Dah da da da
Dah da da da

O Samuel Johnsing is a man
  of color you all know,
And when among the color'd gals,
  He is the dandy beau.

2.
Oh Sam he is a music man,
  He plays his music nice;
And when he plays the violin,
  He gives the tone the spice;
I heard him play the serapheme,
  He plays the flute quite well;
But when he touch'd the light guitar,
  How sweet his tones do tell.
