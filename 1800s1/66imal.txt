1. Within the nations heart to day,
In honor brightly set,
There lives a cherish’d memory
That buddeth greenly yet,
And ever will time cannot, change
The love which death has made
Sacred to all, yet to become
The people’s heritage.

2. But words are ever, weak for praise,
There is no need to dwell
Upon the strong and tender heart
That all could read so well;
Always for worthy victories won
Is paid a costly price,
Then freedom at her need has had
A worthy sacrafice.
