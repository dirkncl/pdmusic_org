1.
The spot where the torrent leaped over the rock,
The sturdy old oak its power would mock,
Was the grave of my darling, my dear Geraldine,
The waters closed o'er her, no more was she seen.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh sweet Geraldine, why taken from me,
Why do these tears fall when thinking of thee.
Oh bitter the pang thy hard fate to moan,
Thro' life am I now left to wander alone.

2.
Thro' forest and bower, in meadow and tree,
Her gay tones resounded so joyous and free,
But nature seemed hushed and soft breezes sighed
'Round the treacherous spot where Geraldine died.

3.
The sad winds will murmur more mournfully now;
The wan leaves will drop from the old forest bough,
And ages remember the sweet form that hied
To bathe in the spot where Geraldine died.
