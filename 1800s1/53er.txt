1.
Oh, Ella Ree, so kind and true,
In the little church yard lies,
Her grave am bright wid drobs ob dew,
But brighter were her eyes.

REFRAIN
Den carry me back to Tennessee,
Dar let me live and die,
Among de fields ob yaller corn,
And de land whar Ella lie.

CHORUS
Den carry me back to Tennessee,
Dar let me live and die,
Among de fields ob yaller corn,
And de land whar Ella lie.

2.
Her pretty eyes and gentle form,
Methinks I yet can see,
I love de spot whar she was born
Way down in Tennessee.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
De summer moon will rise and set,
And de night birds thrill dar lay,
And de possum and coon so softly step
Round de grave of Ella Ree.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
