1.
DUET
Once we had a fragrant blossom,
Full of sweetness, full of loove,
And the angels came and pluck'd it,
For the beauteous realms above.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Little Bennie was our darling,
Pride of all the hearts at home;
But the breezes floating lightly,
Came and whisper'd Bennie come.

2.
Tearfully we lowly laid him
'Neath the grass that grew so green;
And the form of gentle Bennie
In our home no more was seen.

3.
Years have passed, and still we miss him,
And our hearts ne'er throb with glee,
When we think of little Bennie,
Who on earth no more we'll see.

4.
Oh, sweet Bennie when we meet thee
In the joyous realms above,
Gladly will we haste to greet thee
Filled all our hearts with love.
