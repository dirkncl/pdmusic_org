1.
Oft have I mark'd, as o'er the sea
We've swept before the wind,
That those whoe hearts were on the shore,
Cast longing looks behind,
That those, that those whose hearts were on the shore,
Cast longing looks behind;
While they whose hopes have elsewhere been,
Have watch'd with anxious eyes,
To see the hills that lay before,
Faint o'er the waters rise,
To see the hills
Faint o'er the waters rise.
Faint o'er the waters rise.

2.
'Tis thus as o'er the sea of life
Our onward course we track,
That anxious sadness looks before,
The happy still look back;
That anxious, anxious sadness looks before,
The happy still look back;
Still smiling on the course they've pass'd
As earnest of the rest,
'Tis Hope's the charm of wretchedness,
While Mem'ry wooes the blest.
'Tis Hope's the charm
While Mem'ry wooes the blest.
