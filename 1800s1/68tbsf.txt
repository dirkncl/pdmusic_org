1.
There is a charm I can't explain,
  About a girl I've seen.
My heart beats fast when she goes past,
  In a dark dress trim'd in green.
Her eyes are bright as evening stars,
  So loving and so shy,
And the folks all stop and look around
  Whenever she goes by.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
And I feel just as happy as a big sunflow'r,
  That nods and bends in the breezes,
And my heart is as light, as the wind that blows,
  The breeze from off the tree-zees,

2.
As days passed on as we became,
  Like friends of olden times,
I thought the question I would pop,
  And ask her to be mine,
But the answer I recieved next day,
  How could she treat me so!
Instead of being mine for life
  She simply answered No.

3.
I went next day dressed in my best
  This young girl for to see,
To ask her if she would explain
  Why she had shaken me,
She said she really felt quite sad
  To cause me such distress,
And then I said "won't you be mine?"
  Of course she answered yes.
