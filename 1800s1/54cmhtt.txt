1. Home, good old home, Where I was so happy and free,
With father and mother and sister and brother,
  We liv’d down in old Tennessee;
But now I’m weary and sad, As far from the old folks I roam,
I want to go back for to hunt the deer track,
  And to wath for the possum and coon.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
O, carry me home,
For never a place can I see,
Where ever I roam far away and alone,
So dear as old Tennessee.

2. I want to go where the sugar can’s growing so green,
For many a day have I wander’d away
  To watch the old mill by the stream;
Then when the night had come and the darkey’s work was done,
We gather’d around for a dance on the ground,
  To the sound of the old tambourine.

3. I think of the days when merry old corn shucking came,
When seated beside my young Tennessee bride,
  With never a care or a pain;
The boys all merry and free as they set neath the old pine tree,
The fiddle and bones sound the happy old tones,
  When we joined in the sweet melody.

4. Now I’m far away and lonely and sad is my lot,
I never can rest till my journy is past,
  And I again greet my old cot;
From my childhood’s happy home my steps will never roam,
I’ll take by my side my young Tennessee bride,
  And live ever happy at home.
