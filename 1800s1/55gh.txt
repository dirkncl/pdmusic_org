1.
Going Home@! Going Home!
  What pleasure to each heart;
To scenes of childhood we will roam,
  And from life's cares depart.
Though many years have rolled along,
  Since first I left that dear old spot,
No earthly pleasure e'er held sway,
  Like childhood's youthful, happy lot.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Going Home! Going Home!
  What pleasure to each heart;
To scenes of childhood we will roam,
  And from life's cares depart.

2.
Dear old Home! Dear old Home!
  Sweet music in that strain;
'Twill make the hardest heart relent,
  Or age seem young again.
Those old familiar scenes how changed,
  The red School-house and play-ground too;
Still to that spot I love to go,
  And youthful scenes once more renew.

3.
Happy hours! Happy hours!
  To mem'ry still how dear;
Those youthful walks and shady bowers,
  To life's sad change give cheer.
Let me climb those hills again,
  Or walk the fields I loved to roam;
Then will this heart, and not till then,
  Feel happy in its childhood home.
