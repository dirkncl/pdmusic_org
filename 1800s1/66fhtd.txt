1. Once five hundredthousand demons
were cast loose upon this world:
But alas! of all these demons
None possessed a mite of gold,
But alas! of all these demons
None possessed a mite of gold;
Therefore all began to snivel,
All together set to cry;
None of all these hopeless devils,
seemed to know what they should try
None of all these hopeless devils,
seemed to know what they should try

2. Cried old nick, the chief of Evil
Laughing ’till his sides did ache;
Lord have mercy! but these devils
are the silliest of my make!
Lord have mercy! but these devils
are the siliest of my make!
Then wicked wits were sorely tried,
Every one was desperate,
Whose kind advice these devils cried—
can retrieve our mournful fate
Whose kind advice these devils cried
can retrieve our mournful fate

3. Then said Pipifox, the smallest,
You’re a silly set I vow
Look at me, though not the tallest
I’m the devil comme il faut,
Look at me, though not the tallest,
I’m the devil comme il faut.
Now you’ve thirst and have no wine,
Which is agony confessed
When goblets through yon’ windows shine
Of wine there is the very best!
When goblets through yon’ windows shine
Of wine there is the very best!
Yonder is the townhouse cellar
Where good quarters we can find good
quarters we can find.
Have no gold we for the seller,
What of that who stays behind,
who stays behind!
Tho’ the door is locked and bolted,
Should it cause us to refrain!
Has yet lock a demon halted,
When the keyhole did remain,
the keyhole did remain.
This well pleased the thirsty demons,
who forthwith leaped thro’ the hole
And at once in demon fashion,
wine by thousand bottles stole,
And at once in demon fashion,
Wince be thousand bottles stole
sang their songs in wildest chous;
Shouting praise to love and wine!
And just think how indecorous
Drank ’till near the sun did shine.
And just think how indecorous
drank ’till near the sun did shine.
When the cock proclaimed the morning,
And the flasks were emptied all
And the imps asleep from drinking
Then old Nick gave them a call,
Forces into each empty bottle
a besotted demon then
Sealed instantly these impish rogues
safely in their glassy pen.
Demons full fivehundred thousand,
To escape have tried in vain,
And these struggling sparkling pris’ners
are by mortals called Champagne,
And these struggling sparkling pris’ners
are by mortals called Champagne;
When the corks are freely popping
Fun and passion have full sway,
When wild songs are loudly roaring,
Then the devil is to pay,
yes then the devil is to pay,
yes then the devil is to pay.
