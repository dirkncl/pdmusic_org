1. Farewell! to my home, and its own happy hearth,
Farewell to thee, Erin, thou land of my birth;
I leave thy green valleys and wander from thee,
To seek for a home, in the land of the free.
As o’er the wide waters the vessel shall ply,
And the hills in the distance shall fade from mine eye,
Afar and afar each hillow shall roll,
A sigh for thy beauties will sadden my soul.

2. See the signal for sailing Oh! fain would I gaze,
On the rocks which I climbed in my happier days;
When I watched for the see bird and looked on the shore,
As it walked to the rush, of the ocean’s dread roar.
But the breeze and the billow for bid the delay,
The sail is unfurled away and away;
I wander forever green Erin from thee,
To seek for a home in the land of the free.
