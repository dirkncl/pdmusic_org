1. Ye gentlemen and ladies fair,
  On my affliction pity take;
For when I show the greatest care,
  A perfect sound I cannot make:
I stammer when I try to sing,
  The more I strive, the worse it grows;
Oh! it is like a little sting,—
  This tickling in the nose.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]

2. I try a malady to cure,
  With drugs and potions day by day;
And still the evil I endure,
  Although a year has roll’d away:
The drinks I take disturb my heart,
  And if I snuff— O, horrid woes!
It seems my senses will depart,
  This tickling in my nose.

3. If I to soirée dare to go,
  With gentlemen of manners fine;
And they should ask a sweet morceau,
  I could not sing a single line:
My voice— it then begins to fail,
  The company impatient grows;
I tell them ’tis of no avail—
  This tickling in my nose.

4. I’ll review my history o’er,
  To you my stammering to explain;
Drings, baths, nor drugs will I want more,
  To dissipate and ease my pain:
But ladies fair and gentlemen,
  ’Tis you alone can give repose;
If you are pleased— ’tis truly then
  The heart that tickles not the nose.
