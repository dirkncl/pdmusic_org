1. Oh they tell me thou’rt dead drunk, Johnny Darling;
That last smile was one too much for thee;
Did they tell thee I was “tight” Johnny Darling,
Or so drunk that I could neither hear, nor see?
Oh! I know not how often, I’ve drank with you today;
But I wish this plaguey sidewalk Johnny Darling,
Would keep down out of my way.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh Johnny! Hie, Johnny!
Oh the Ale and Cider’s working, Johnny Darling,
And the Champagne is flying to my head;
If I don’t go home right soon, Johnny Darling.
They will pick me up, and lay me out for dead!

2. I’m lying down to rest Johnny Darling;
This gutter’s now a sleeping room for me;
Oh! could’st thou hear me snoring, Johnny Darling—
Don’t you hear John! I’m calling for thee?
Methinks I see a great rat,
He stares so queer at me;
I “swore” I b’lieve he knows Johnny Darling,
I’m drunk as any other Fool could be.

3. ’Tis useless this complaining, Johnny Darling,
But I tell you what them Spirits was so fine,
That till every dime was spent, Johnny Darling,
I couldn’t stop a swiggin’ at the wine!
Oh, a huge great "brick" I’m hearing,
Though I scarce can lift my hat;
I wish I could stop dreaming, Johnny Darling,
Of my drunken friend that pesky blindeyed rat!
