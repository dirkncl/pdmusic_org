1. Is it any body’s business,
If a gentle man should choose,
To wait upon a lady,
If that lady don’t refuse!
Or to speak a little plainer,
That the meaning all may know,
Is it any body’s business
If a lady has a beau!
Is it any body’s business
If a lady has a beau!

2. Is it any body’s business
But the lady’s, if her beau
Rideth out with other ladies,
And does not let her know?
Is it any body’s business
But the gentleman’s, if she
Should accept another escort.
Where he does not chance to be?
Should accept another excort
Where he does not chance to be?

3. If a person’s on the sidewalk,
Whether great, or whether small,
Is it any body’s business
Where that person means to call!
Or if you were a person
While he’s calling any where,
Is it certain if it is not.
There are some who make it so
For we’re certain if it is not.
There are some who make it so.

4. The substance of our query,
Simply stated, would be this;
Is it any body’s business
What another’s business is?
Whether ’tis, or whether tis’nt,
We would really like to know,
For we’re any body’s business
What his business may be there?
Is it any of your business
What his business may be there?
