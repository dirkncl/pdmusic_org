1. Ella Dean, sweet Ell;a Dean!
  Will you go alone with me
To the hills and meadows green,
  Close by the sparkling sea?

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Oh! there’s my happy home,
There’s my happy home;
Oh! there’s my happy home,
Close by the sparkling sea.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Oh! there’s my happy home,
There’s my happy home,
Oh! there’s my happy home,
Close by the sparkling sea.

2. Roses grow around my cot,
  Blythly hums the honey bee;
There’s a charm around that spot,
  Close by the sparkling sea.

3. Sweet content is reigning there,
  All are happy— all are free;
Ne’er is heard the sigh of care,
  Close by the sparkling sea.

4. I can give an honest heart,
  Fill’d with truth and love for thee;
Joy shall smile whene’er thou azrt
  Close by the sparkling sea.
