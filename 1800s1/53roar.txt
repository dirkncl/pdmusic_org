1. Singing through the forests, 
Battling over ridges, 
Shooting under arches, 
Running over bridges; 
Whizzing through the mountain. 
Buzzing o’er the vale, 
Bless me this is pleasant 
A riding on a rail.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Singing thro’ the mountain, 
Buzzing o’er the vale, 
Bless me, this is pleasant, 
A riding on a rail, 
Singing thro’ the mountain, 
Buzzing o’er the vale, 
Bless me, this is pleasant, 
A riding on a rail.

2. Men of different stations,
In the eye of fame,
Here are very quickly
Coming to the same;
High and lowly people,
Birds of every feater,
On a common level,
A travelling together.

3. Stranger on the left,
Closing up his peepers,
Now he snores amain,
Like the seven sleepers;
At his feet a volume
Gives the explanation. 
How the man grew stupid
All from association.

4. Ancient maiden lady,
Anxiously remarks,
That there must be peril
’Mong so many sparks;
Roguish looking fellow,
Turning to a strangger, 
Says its his opinion
She is out of danger.

5. Woman with her baby
Sitting on a vis­avis,
Baby keeps a squalling,
Woman looks at me,
Asks about the distance,
Says it’s tiresome talking, 
Noises of the cars
Are very, very shocking.

6. Market woman careful
Of the precious casket,
Knowing eggs is eggs,
Tightly holds her basket;
Finding that a smash,
If it came would surely 
Send her eggs to pot
Rather prematurely.
