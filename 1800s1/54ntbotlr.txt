1. Near the banks of that lone river
Where the water lilies grow,
Breathed the fairest flower that ever
Bloomed and faded years ago.
How we met and loved and parted,
None on earth can ever know,
Nor how pure and gentle hearted
Beamed the mourn’d one years ago.

2. Like the stream with lilies laden,
Will life’ future current flow,
Till in heaven I meet the maiden,
Fondly cherished years ago.
Hearts that love like mine for get not
They’re the same in weal or woe;
And that star of memory set not,
In the grave of years ago.
