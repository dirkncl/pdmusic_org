1. Hail! Columbia happy land,
Hail! ye heros! heav’n born band,
Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,
Who fought and bled in freedom’s cause,
And when the storm of war was gone,
Enjoy’d the peace your valor won.
Let indedendence be our boast,
Evermind ful what it cost,
Ever grateful for the price,
Let its altar reach the skies.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Firm, united let us be,
Rallying round our Liberty,
As a band of brothers join’d,
Peace and safety we shall find.

CHORUS, sung after each REFRAIN
Firm united let us be,
Rallying round our Liberty,
As a band of brothers join’d
Peace and safety we shall find.

2. Sons of Patriot sires, of yore
Preserve your rights, defend your shores,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Invade the shrine where sacred ties,
Of toil and blood the well earn’d prize.
While off’ring peace, sincere and just,
To heav’n we place our steadfast trust
That truth and justice will prevail,
And ev’ry scheme of discord fail.

3. Sound, sound the trump of Fame,
Let Washington’s lov’d name,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Let every clime to Freedom dear,
Listen with a joyful ear;
With wond’rous skill, with matchless power,
 He govern’d in the fearful hour
 Of horrid war, and rul’d with ease
Our  happy bind in time of peace.

4. Behold the Chief, who now commands,
Call’d forth to serve the people stands—
The rock on which the storm will beat,
The rock on which the storm will beat,
But arm’d with virture, firm and true,
His hopes are fixed on heaven and you.
Should Hope be sinking in dismay,
Should clouds obscure Columbia’s day,
Let us, with minds from changes free,
Resolve on death or Liberty.
