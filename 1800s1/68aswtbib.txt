1. The bugle call rings loud and clear,
And loud the rolling drum;
Our comrades haste to seek their posts,
The time for work has come;
The beacon fires burn bright again,
They flash on ev’ry hill
From sea to sea the shout goes up,
We march to victory!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Hurrah! hurrah! for our noble cause!
Hurrah for our leaders true!
We’ll stand by the men who stood by the flag,
And so will the Boys in Blue.
And so will we all, and so will we all,
Our pledge we now renew:
We’ll strike once more for the cause we love,
And so will the Boys in Blue!

2. Thro’ gloomy years of bloody strife,
We’ve battled side by side;
With brave, true hearts and sinewy arms
We’ve stemm’d each fi’ry tide.
Eternal Justice nerv’d us then,
And gave the conqu’ring will
With hearts aflame, and God our trust,
We strike for Justice still.

3. Our motto, equal rights to all;
The ballot shall be free;
Who stakes his life to save the flag,
May vote with you and me;
We’ll ask him not his birth or kin,
Or prate about his hue
But ev’ry man unstained with crime
May vote with boys in Blue.

4. We’ll keep the nation’s sacred pledge,
Pay ev’ry dime we owe;
Each loyal arm will gladly strike
Each day an extra blow
Repudiate— we scorn the word
And those who use it too
We are not knaves or bankrupts yet
Nor are the Boys in Blue.

5. Haste, loyal men, fill up your ranks,
Brink ev’ry soldier out;
This struggle ought to be our last,
And give the final rout
But lo, they come! a sea of men!
Impatient for the fray
They come! they come! in throngs so vast,
Our work shall seem but play.
