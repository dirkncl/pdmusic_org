1. The thunder of battle loud roars on the wave,
As Columbia’s proud sons her honor to save,
Rush forth to the conflict with shouts of the free,
And mingle their blood with the foam of the sea.
  And mingle their blood with the foam of the sea.
The cries of the wounded are piercing the sky,
As the deathdealing shot comes whistling by
And the decks are flowing with blood of the brave,
Who perish thus nobly their country to save,
  Who perish thus nobly their country to save.

2. Why pauses the combat when fiercest the fray?
Why falters each seaman with look of dismay?
Brave Lawrence has fallen! the hero’s laid low,
And he sinks on the deck defying the foe.
  And he sinks on the deck defying the foe.
The fire if tbe battle still gleams in his eye,
And again rings his voice in tones clear and high,
“Don’t give up the ship!“
“Don’t give up the ship!” nail her flag to the mast—
It never was struck except to the blast.
  It never was struck except to the blast.

3. With one mighty effort he gasps at his sword,
And cries now my boys let’s the enemy board!
Inspir’d by their cheers, he endeavors to rise;
He struggles— he falters— and sinking he dies.
  He struggles— he falters— and sinking he dies. 
His spirit has fled to that heaven of rest,
Where war and commotion disturb not his breast;
But his glory will live in history’s scroll,
And his name will survive tho’ ages may roll.
  And his name will survive though ages may roll.
