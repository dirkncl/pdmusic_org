1. Yes, Annie dear, my lov’d one, 
From o’er the deep blue sea, 
Thy Willie, long an Exile, 
Returning smiles on thee. 
I saw thee, love, in dreamland, 
For mem’ry op’ed the gate; 
There listen’d to thy silv’ry voice. 
In fancy, heard thee speak, 
It joy’d my heart, depress’d with care, 
And clouded o’er with gloom; 
It soften’d anguish and despair 
And whisper’d welcome, home!

2. Our little ones were there, love, 
So full of life and glee; 
I saw them all, as now, love, 
They cluster’d round thy knee. 
With hands uprais’d,— with tearful eyes, 
They breath’d a fervent pray’r, 
That God would bring their Father back. 
I woke— they were not there. 
For many a long and weary day 
As onward thro’ the foam; 
’Mid storm and tempest— dire dismay— 
My dreams were still, of home!

3. And now, with propects bright, love, 
Thy Willie finds his rest; 
His ev’ry burden lighten’d 
By her he loves the best. 
The blissful dream of happy years 
Is Annie by my side; 
Hope smiles on all my doubts and fears— 
Of storms, and ocean’s wide. 
The dangers of the surging sea, 
We’ll talk of years to come, 
With list’ning Cherubs on my knee, 
And Annie’s welcome home!
