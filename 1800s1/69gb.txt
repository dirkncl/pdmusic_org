1. Gone where the shadows of life cannot come, 
Where ev’ry stranger may find a sweet home. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Where there are treasures of beauty untold, 
Rivers of silver and mountains of gold. 
Weep not to miss one from earth’s weary shore, 
Earth has an angel less,— Heaven one more.

2. Gone where the angels are chanting His praise, 
Freed from the tumult of earth’s dreary ways.

3. Gone where the battle is over and won, 
And the true life of the spirit began.
