1. Oh sing once more those dear familiar lays,
Whose gliding measure every bosom thrills,
And takes my heart back to the happy days,
When first I sung them on my native hills.
With the fresh feelings of the olden times,
I hear them now upon a foreign shore,
The simple music and the artless rhymes.
Oh sing those dear familiar lays once more.
Oh sing once more those dear familiar lays,
Whose gliding measure every bosom thrills,
And takes my heart back to the happy days,
When first I sung them on my native hills
Those cheerful lays,
Of other days,
Those cheerful lays,
Of other days
Oh sing those cheerful lays, those lays once more.

2. Oh sing once more those joyprovoking strains,
Which, half forgotten, in my mem’ry dwell;
They send the lifeblood bounding thro’ my veins,
And linger round me like a fairy spell.
The songs of home are to the human heart,
Far dearer than the notes that songbirds pour,
And of our very nature form a part,
Then sing those dear familiar lays once more.
Oh sing once more those joy provoking strains,
Which, half forgotten, in my mem’ry dwell;
They send the lifeblood bounding thro’ my veins,
And linger round me like a fairy spell.
Those cheerful lays,
Of other days,
Those cheerful lays,
Of other days.
Oh sing those cheerful lays, those lays once more.
