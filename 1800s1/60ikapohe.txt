1. I know a pair of hazel eyes
So tender and so bright,
That I could sit a livelong day,
And gaze upon their light.
And gaze upon their light.
How would my heart impulsive beat
If, when on mine they rove,
Those hazel eyes should give to me
A single look of love!
Those hazel eyes should give to me
A single look of love!
A single look of love!

2. I know a pair of rosy lips
Whose smile is so divine,
That I would give the world to press
Them fervently to mine.
Yes! fervently to mine.
How would my soul dilate with joy
If, when to speak they move,
Those rosy lips should say to me
A single word of love!
Those rosy lips should say to me
A single word of love!
A single word of love!

3. I know a pair of snowy arms,
And what delight were mine,
If round my neck one fond embrace
Those snowy arms should twine!
Those snowy arms should twine!
The look, the word, the fond embrace
So dear to me would prove
That earth enchanted, would appear
A paradise of love!
That earth enchanted would appear
A paradise of love!
A paradise of love!
