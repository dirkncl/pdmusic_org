1.
We meet no more, thy softened tones,
That used to charm my ear,
Greet me no more at eventide,
In songs my heart to cheer,
No more in the fragrant bower we meet,
Beside the ripling stream,
When the stars of eve on her azure breast,
Thro' the quivering leaflets beam,
  When the stars of eve on her azure breast,
  Thro' the quivering leaflets beam.

2.
I seek the forests shadowy dell,
The blue-eyed violet's home,
And the bypath through the green old wood,
Where once we lov'd to roam,
And I wander to the grotto dear,
Far up the mountain side,
Where my car first caught thy vows of love,
That won me for your bride.--
  Where my car first caught thy vows of love,
  The won me for your bride.

3.
On the bosom of the fairy lake,
On a launch my tiny boat,
And silent watch the ripling waves,
That 'neath the moonbeams float,
I take my lute and wake its chords,
That were so dear to me,
But so sadly falls their music tones,
That I turn and weep for thee,--
  But so sadly falls their music tones
  That I turn and weep for thee.

4.
We meet no more, why is it thus?
Alas! no voice is heard,
My heart is a deserted bow'ry,
Reft of its singing bird,
Or like a space in yonder sky,
Where blaz'd a star of light,
But the star has fled, its rays are dead,
And the sky is hish'd in night,
  But the star has fled its rays are dead,
  And the sky is hush'd in night.
