1. Oh! what’s this world a coming to, does any body know, 
Where will we land, if we keep up the pace at which we go? 
Most ev’ry one is bound to dress, and often to extremes; 
And some, to keep the fashions up, oft go beyond their means.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! what’s the world a coming to, can any body tell, 
The greatest study with us all is how to cut a swell.

2. In olden times we used to be contented with enough: 
We used to wear good homespun cloth, and wear it in the rough, 
But now the very best of silks our wants will scarcely meet, 
With here and there a trailing yard to sweep the muddy street.

3. There’s Mister Shoddy, o’er the way, who used to be quite poor; 
He ’listed in his country’s cause, and kept a sutler’s store: 
He now rides in his princely coach, while “Pompey” holds the reins; 
But naughty X mys, “Jenkins,” says he’s got more bonds than brains.

4. We’er bound to shine, both old and young, let fortune frown or smile; 
And if we don’t have bread to eat, “you bet” we’ll have the style! 
So jump aboard, for time is up, down “Fashion’s stream” we’ll float, 
If aught is wrong, ’twill be made right when Ladies come to vote.
