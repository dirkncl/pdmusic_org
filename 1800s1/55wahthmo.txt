1. Wanted— a hand to hold my own, 
As down life’s vale I glide; 
Wanted— an arm to lean upon, 
Forever by my side. 
Wanted— a firm and steady foot, 
With step secure and free, 
To take its straight and onward pace, 
Over life’s path with me. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Wanted— a hand to hold my own, 
As down life’s vale I glide; 
Wanted— an arm to lean upon,
 Forever by my side.

2. Wanted— a form erect and high,
A head above my own;
So much that I might walk beneath
Its shadow o’er me thrown.
Wanted— an eye, within whose depth
Mine own might look, and see
Uprisings from a guileless heart,
O’erflown with love for me.

3. Wanted— a lip, whose kindest smile
Would speak for me alone;
A voice, whose richest melody
Would breathe affection’s tone.
Wanted— a true, religious soul,
To pious purpose given,
With whom my own might pass along
The road that leads to Heaven.
