1. My pretty Nelly, dear, 
As long as we’re both here, 
And nather of us gone away, 
I’d like to speak to you, 
Just one sweet word or two, 
That’s bother’d my poor brain all day. 
But my heart is in my mouth, 
And that’s a perfect drought, 
Was ever in such plight a lover true; 

[REFRAIN sung twice after each verse]
Then won’t ye Nelly now, 
Just help me any how, 
And I’ll do as much some time for you. 

2. But Nelly ain’t it quare,
Yet if you assint there
Or if I was some other place,
The easiest thing to do,
Would be that word or two,
But I can’t say it face to face,
For my voice gets thin and wake,
Whene’er I try to spake,
And faith the very words they all seem new. 

3. Now Nelly I believe,
You’re laughing in your sleeve,
Altho’ you’re looking so demure
I’d think ye never knew
What I’m trying to do
You’re having your own fun I’m sure
But Nelly though my words
Just fly away like birds
You know what my poor heart was always true.
