1.
I'm a gay old Carpet-Bagger!
O! don't you understand!
'Mong the color'd folks I swagger
Down in the cotton land
Now I got no eddication;
Of brains I does not brag,
But I owns a big plantation
All in my carpet bag.

CHORUS ad lib
I'm a gay old Carpet-Bagger!
O' can't you understand!
'Mong the color'd folks I swagger
Down in the cotton land.

2.
In the North I was Nobody,
O! don't you understand!
Now I drinks my wine, and toddy
King of the cotton land!
For I drives the old slave master;
he calls my scallawag
While he cusses fast, and faster,
I fills my carpet bag.

(CHORUS ad lib)

3.
I'm the loyal Carpet-Bagger,
Who rules the cotton land;
I'm a happy scalla wagger,
O! can't you understand!
For to Congress goes some mornin'
This curst old scallawag!
And I pays 'em back for scornin'
My loyal carpet bag.

(CHORUS ad lib)

4.
But I hears a storm a-comin'
O! yes I understand!
Now we'll get kick'd our for bummin'
Around this cotton land,
For I hears the nation's thunder;
We've lost our game of brag;
Now I'm off with spoons and plunder
All in my carpet bag.

(CHORUS ad lib)
