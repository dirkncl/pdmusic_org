1. Backward, turn backward, oh, time in your flight, 
Make me a child again just for tonight! 
Mother come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart as of yore 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair 
Over my slumbers youre loving watch keep 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep, 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!

2. Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love like motherlove ever has shone 
No other worship abides and endures 
Faithful, unselfish, and patient, like yours 
None like a mother can charm away pain. 
From the sick soul and the world weary brain; 
Slumber’s soft calm o’er my heavy lids creep 
Rock me to sleep. mother, rock me to sleep.

3. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again as of old. 
Let it drop over my forehead tonight, 
Shading my faint eyes away from the light, 
For with its sunny edged shadows once more, 
Happy will throng the sweet visions of yore. 
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep 
Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.
