1. The right of Nebraska now wakens my lay,
I’ll seek to protect her from tyrany’s sway,
I love her broad lands so wild and so free;
Her pure air of freedom is ever sweet to me.

CHROUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then awake sons and sires, loud echo’s prolong,
Protest with your might, ’gainst injustice and wrong,
Your try demands it, be faithful and true,
Protect well her honor and she’ll ever bless you,
Your country demands it, be faithful and true,
Protect well her honor and she’ll ever bless

2. The compromise made let it firmly endure,
’Twas sealed by as wise and free hearts, I am sure,
As those who now sit, and with vilainess skill,
Are struggling to pass the vile Nebraska hill.

3. The home of Nebraska is in the far west,
Where peace and goodwill are found in each breast,
Take care! Sunny South! your curse cannot dwell
In the home of Nebraska, we all love so well.

4. The Olive plant there, shall bare her fair breast,
And serve in her bower the sweet dove a nest,
Where softly and sweetly she’ll warble the strain,
Nebraska dwell safely peace within thee reign.

5. The proud flag of freedom was not bought with gold,
Its price above rubies can never be told;
Its bright stars of glory shall gladden our way,
Ever cheering our efforts to drive wrong away.
