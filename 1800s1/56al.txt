1. Oh, where’s the heart, to me so dear,
  The form so light and free;
The eye unclouded by a tear,
  That sweetly beam’d on me;
Those ruby lips that often press’d,
  This sad and aching brow,
Those gentle hands that soothed my rest,
  Oh, where, where are they now?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then weep, weep for Anna dear,
My own lost Anna Lee
For she sleeps in yonder churchyard drear,
Beneath the willow tree.

2. That silv’ry voice I loved to hear,
  My lonely hours beguiled;
That merry laugh, my soul would cheer
  And e’en make sadness smile,
That voice is hushed, and veiled the eye,
  That hand is cold and still,
That pulseless heart inhumed must lie,
  Nor beat, nor feel a thrill.

3. I mourn the past, ’tis sweet to mourn,
  For one so pure and true;
Tho’ lonely now and thus forlorn,
  I pass life’s journey through,
Yet still I fancy she is near;
  Oh! may th’illusion last,
For pleasures naught on earth appear
  That can eclipse the past.
