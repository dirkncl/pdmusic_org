1. It is not as it used to be,
  When you and I were young,
When round each elm and maple tree,
  The honeysuckles clung;
But still I love the cottage
  Where I passed my early years,
Though not a single face it there,
  That memory endears,
      Though not a single face is there,
      That memory endears.

2. It is not as it used to be!
  The moss is on the roof,
And from their nest beneath the caves,
  The swallows keep aloof.
The robbins bow they used to sing,
  When you and I were young;
And how did flit the wild bee’s wing,
  The opening flowers among!
      And how did flit the wild bee’s wing
      The opening flowers among!

3. It is not as it used to be!
  The voices loved of yore,
And the forms that we were wont to see,
  We see and hear no more.
No more! alas! we look in vain,
  For those to whom we clung,
And loved as we can love but once,
  When you and I were young.
    And loved as we can love but once,
    When you and I were young.
