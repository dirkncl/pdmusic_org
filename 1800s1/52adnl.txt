Adieu, adieu dear native land! 
We leave thy happy shore. 
Farewell ye kind and friendly band, 
With constant heart and gen’rous hand! 
Who ne’er may see us more, 

Adieu, adieu dear native land! 
We leave thy happy shore. 
Tho’ rolling oceans may divide, 
Tho’ endless years may intervene, 
Still hearts that grew up side by side
Change not with change of scene. 

The heart, the trusting heart so long our own; 
The eye whose glance was joy, was joy to see, 
Shall ever in our mem’ry live 
Till life shall cease to be. 

Adieu, adieu dear native land! 
We leave thy happy shore, 
Farewell ye kind and friendly band 
With constant heart and gen’rous hand 
Who ne’er may see us more. 

Adieu, adieu dear native land! 
We leave thy happy shore, 
What e’er our lot, 
Shall never be forgot.
