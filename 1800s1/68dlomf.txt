Dear land of my Fathers, with what fond endearment,
Afar o’er the ocean in some foreign clime;
My heart swells with rapture, my soul with emotion.
As proudly I claim that Columbia is mine.
Thy mem’ry unfaiding shall swell in my bosom;
While nobly I’ll boast of thee, land of the free,
As I stray on the banks of the “Seine,” “Thames,” or “Danube,”
I love thee more dear, though far distant from me.

CHORUS
Dear land of my Fathers, with what fond endearment,
Afar o’er the ocean in some foreign clime;
My heart swells with rapture, my soul with emotion,
As proudly I claim that Columbia is mine.
