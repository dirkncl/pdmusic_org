1. Close the ranks firmly, as onward we go,
Victory now and forever
Down with the traitor, the ingrate and foe,
Who endeavors the seeds of disunion to sow,
Or this glorious Republic to sever.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Then close the ranks firmly, march onward again,
Let the Union of States be our glorious refrain.

2. The flag of our country, oh long may it wave,
With its stars and stripes proudly blended,
And deep rest the curse on the coward or knave,
Wherever he dwells in this land of the brave,
Who would leave its broad folds undefended.

3. “In Union is strength,” let the watchword resound
From the North to the South, “our protection
In all our commingling of interests is found,
Where mutual forbearance and kindness abound,
And a gen’rous fraternal affection.
