1. O, the river is up and the channel is deep,
And the wind blows steady and strong.
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep
As we row the old boat along!
O, the water is bright and flashing like gold,
In the rays of the morning sun,
And old Dinah’s up away out of the cold
And getting the hoecake done.

[Refrain]
O, the river is up and the channel is deep,
And the wind blows steady and strong!
Let the splash of your oars the measure keep,
As we row the old boat along.

CHORUS
Down the river, down the river,
Down the Ohio;
Down the river, down the river,
Down the Ohio;
Down the river, down the river,
Down the Ohio;
Down the river, down the river,
Down the Ohio.

2. O, the massa is proud of the old breadbore,
For it brings  him plenty of tin.
O, the crew they is darkies, the car ­ go is corn,
And the sentry comes tumbling in;
There is plenty on board for the darkies to eat
And der’s something to drink and to smoke,
Der’s the ban ­ jo, the bones and the tambourine
Der’s the [song] and the comic joke.
