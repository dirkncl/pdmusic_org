1. The dearest spot of earth  to me 
Is Home, sweet Home! 
The fairy land I long to see 
Is Home! sweet Home! 
There, how charm’d the sense of hearing! 
There, where love is so endearing! 
All the world is not so cheering 
As Home sweet Home! 
The dearest spot of earth to me 
Is Home sweet Home 
The fairy land I long to see 
Is Home sweet Home!

2. I’ve taught my heart the way to prize 
My Home, sweet Home! 
I’ve learned to look with lover’s eyes 
On Home! sweet Home! 
There, where vows are truly plighted! 
There, where hearts are so united! 
All the world besides I’ve slighted 
For Home, sweet Home! 
The dearest spot of earth to me 
Is Home sweet Home 
The fairy land I long to see 
Is Home sweet Home!
