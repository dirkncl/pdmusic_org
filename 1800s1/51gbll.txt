1. ’Twas down in Alabama state. 
Our little hut alone did stand; 
A wife and little darkies eight, 
Compos’d our happy happy band, 
We neber can forget my lub, 
De happy hour when fust we met, 
Your voice was softer dan de dove, 
Your lips was sweeter sweeter yet.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Goodbye, Good bye Linda lub! 
Oh, Linda fare you well, 
My Massa say Ise getting old, 
Dis darky he must sell.

2. I ’member well dat happy morn,
When Linda say ’twas me she lub;
Dis darkey shellin’ massa’s corn,
And she a washing at de tub!
I tink wid joy upon de dey
When her and I was both made one;
I feel like ’coon in summer day,
A sleeping dare, in de warm sun.

3. We’ve watch’d de little gals and boys
A runing o’er de fields so green,
A happier day of sweeter joys
Dis poor old Darkey neber seen.
A long farewell, my Linda dear.
Our happiness am now all o’er!
Come Linda lub, den dry your tear;
You’ll neber, neber see me more.
