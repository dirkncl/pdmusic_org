Words by Father A. J. Ryan

1.
Fourth from its scabbard pure and bright,
Flash'd the sword of Lee;
For in the front of the deadly fight,
High o'er the brave in the cause of right.
Its stainless sheen like a beacon bright,
Led us to victory.
Its stainless sheen like a beacon bright,
Led us to victory.

2.
Out of the scabbard where full long,
It slumber'd peacefully;
Restored from its rest by the battle song,
Shielding the feeble -- smiting the strong,
Guarding the right avenging the wrong,
Gleamed the sword of Lee,
Guarding the right avenging the wrong,
Gleamed the sword of Lee.

3.
Fourth from its scabbard high in air,
Beneath Virginia's sky;
And they who saw it gleaming there,
And knew who bore it knelt to swear
That where that sword led, they would dare,
To follow and to die.
Yes where that sword led, they would dare,
To follow and to die.

4.
Out of its scabbard! never hand
waved sword from stain as free,
Nor purer sword led braver hand,
Nor braver bled for a brighter land,
Nor brighter land had a cause as grand,
Nor cause a chief like Lee,
Nor brighter land had a cause as grand,
Nor cause a chief like Lee.

5.
Forth from its scabbard! how we pray'd
That sword might victor be.
And when our triumph was delayed,
And many hearts grew sore afraid,
We still hoped on while gleamed the blade
Of noble Robert Lee,
We still hoped on while gleamed the blade
Of noble Robert Lee.

6.
Forth from its scabbard! all in vain!
Up flashed the sword of Lee,
'Tis shrouded now in its sheath again,
It sleeps the sleep of our noble slain,
Defeated yet without a stain
Proudly and peacefully,
Defeated yet without a stain
Proudly and peacefully.
