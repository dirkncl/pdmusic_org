1. This question now I would propose 
To ev’ry wife both grave and gay 
To all the girls who have their beaus 
And well I know what they will say 
A husband is a thing divine 
Exclaims the miss of sweet sixteen 
Oh would the name of wife where mine 
As in my sleep I often dream.

2. The young wife gazes on the form 
That stole her youthful heart away 
And well she recollects the morn 
That usher’d in her bridal day 
The kettle sings a merry tune 
While baby in the cradle 
The ruddy coal lights up the room 
And papa reads while dreary sews.

3. When papa in the morning goes 
Then dearie claims a partting kiss 
And baby cries for well he knows 
His romps till night he’ll sad ly miss 
When evening spreads her mantle grey 
They list for his accustom’d tread 
And dearie chides his long delay 
While baby smiles uppon the bed.

4. And papa pleads as his caress 
His business cares and notes to meet 
Then slips into his wrapper loose 
And puts his slippers on his feet 
Remarks that times look very blue 
And gives a yawn as well he might 
Declares he dont know what to do 
If money keeps so very tight.
