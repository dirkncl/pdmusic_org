1. All hail! unfurl the stripes and stars!
  The banner of the free!
Ten times ten thousand patriots greet
  The shrine of liberty!
Come, with one heart, one hope, one aim,
  An undivided band,
To elevate, with solemn rites,
  The ruler of our land:

CHORUS 1
We with one heart, one hope, one aim,
An undivided band,
To elevate, with solemn rites,
The ruler of our land!

2. Not to invest a potentate
  With robes of majesty—
Not to confer a kingly crown,
  Nor bend a subject knee.
We bow beneath no sceptred sway—
  Obey no royal nod—
Columbia’s sons, erect and free,
  Kneel only to their God!

CHORUS 2
We bow beneath no sceptred sway—
Obey no royal nod—
Columbia’s sons, erect and free,
Kneel only to their God!

3. Our ruler boasts no titled rank,
  No ancient, princely line—
No regal right to sov’reinty,
  Ancestral and divine.
A patriot— at his country’s call,
  Responding to her voice
One of the people— he becomes
  A Sov’reign, by our choice!

CHORUS 3
A patriot— at his country’s call,
  Responding to her voice
One of the people— he becomes
  A Sov’reign, by our choice!

4. And now, before the mighty pile
  We’ve reared to liberty,
He swears to cherish and defend
  The charter of the free!
God of our country! seal his oath
  With thy supreme assent.
God save the Union of the States!
  God save our President!

CHORUS 4
God of our country! seal his oath
  With thy supreme assent.
God save the Union of the States!
  God save our President!
