1.
Oh weep no more sweet Lilly White
Oh weep no more I cried,
For I will soon return again,
And you shall be my bride
’Twas thus with words of love I strove
To put her fears to flight,
But still the tears roll’d down her cheek
When I left Lilly White.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Lilly White, sweet Lilly White,
Farewell to thee my love
Though we may meet no more on earth
Thou shalt be mine alone.

2.
Far, far away from Lilly White,
With master then I went
And roving on from scene to scene
Two dreary years I spent
But still my heart would fondly turn
With feelings of delight,
To think of all the happy days
I’d past with Lilly White.

3.
At length my master weary grew
And said no more we’ll roam
But fill’d with sorrow was my breast
When we arrived at home,
For death with cruel hand had closed
Those eyes so true and bright,
And broken was the loving heart
Of my poor Lilly White.
