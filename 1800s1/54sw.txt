1. They tell of the summer bird’s clear warbling song,
Which sings she when murmurs the streamlet along,
They tell of the musical bird of the night,
They dies while it sings with excess of delight;
But Oh! in there music on land or on sea,
Like woman’s sweet voice, and its soft melody.

2. They dream of the beauty, and breathe to the night,
A tale of its queen in her silvery light,
Of myriad stars as they twinkle around
Her silvery throne and the seat of the crown’d;
But beautiful most are the lines which we trace
Imprinted so softly on woman’s fair face.

3. They say that the flower will turn to the dawn,
The Doe will return to its stricken young fawn,
The bird of the wood ere its daysong is sung,
Will plume its light wing and fly back to its young,
But woman’s proud heart you may ruin and break
’Twill never return, for ’twill never forsake.

4. Then woman, sweet woman, a wreath I’ll entwine,
Of evergreen fresh as the mountain’s sweet pines,
And flowery garlands like crimson and snow,
Will droop o’er that wreath and droop over thy brow;
When youth love daydreams and folly its charms,
Then woman, sweet woman, I’ll fly to thine arms.
