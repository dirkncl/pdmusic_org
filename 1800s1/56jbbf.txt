1. Two hundred and forty three vessels of war,
For what did they build this big fleet for,
To go to the Black and Baltic Main,
And what did it do, it came back again.
G, O, Dobbin, G, O, Dobbin,
And what did it do, it  came back again.

2. Three thousand one hundred and seventy two,
Oh, what in this world did theses Guns do;
They drilled with shot and practic’d with shell,
And saluted her Majesty wonderfull well.
G, O, Dobbin, G, O, Dobbin,
Saluted her majesty wonderfull well.

3. Thirty two thousand eight hundred and ten,
Oh, what have they done all these brave English men;
They potter’d at Sweaborg and fish’d in Azoff,
And man’d all their yards without tumbling off.
G, O, Dobbin, G, O, Dobbin,
And man’d all their yards without tumbling off.
