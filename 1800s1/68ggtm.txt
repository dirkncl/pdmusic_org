1. The time has come for all of us,
  There’s no use now to wait,
And understand what we’re a bout,
  Before it is to late;
To bring about the good old times,
  We’ve got to change the plan,
To  fight it out on this ere line,
  O! General Grant’s the man!

CHORUS 1
To fight it out on this ere line
  O! Generak Grant’s the man!

2. To reconstruct this mighty land
  And do the thing that’s right,
We don’t want any nonsense now
  Or else there’ll be a fight,
We’ve had enough shenanigan,
  Since Congress last began,
To make Peace and Prosperity,
  O! General Grant’s the man!

CHORUS 2
To make Peace and Prosperity,
  O! General Grant’s the man!

3. O now’s the time for all of us,
  To act and have a voice,
And what I sing and Grant to you,
  Is now the people’s choice;
We want a man that’s staunch and true,
  To act as well as plan,
Whose got the nerve to back it up,
  And General Grant’s the man!

CHORUS 3
Whose got the nerve to back it up,
  And General Grant’s the man!

4. So rally boys, get up and get,
  There’s no use now to wait,
But take this matter right in hand,
  Before it is too late;
And give this Grant to Uncle Sam,
  You’ll no regret the plan,
To fill the white House chair “you Bet”
  O! General Grant’s the man! 

CHORUS 4
To fill the white House chair “you Bet”
  O! General Grant’s the man!
