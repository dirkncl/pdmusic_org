1. 
How beautiful ye are, ye wild and woodland flowers, 
Meet both for festal halls and beauty’s courtly bowers; 
Ye wild and woodland flowers! 
How fair to see your cultur’d buds their tints unfold, 
In ;eaves of saphire’s hue, and sunset’s glowing gold. 
Ye leave sweet memories of happy childhood’s years, 
Ere grief hath rung our hearts with pain, our eyes with tears, 
And, like all gifts that He, the beautiful hath given, 
Your blossoms fall like types of promised heaven. 
Wild flowers! wild flowers!  

2. 
Chide not at the theme that wakes the minstrel’s lay, 
At flow’rs, simple wild flow’rs that blossom by the way; 
But thank Him for ev’ry brow His hand in mercy showers, 
And not least among His gifts wild flowers, wild flowers, 
How beautiful ye are ye wild and woodland flowers.
