1. I am a freeman, do you know my standard,
Whose stars and stripes wave ever, evermore,
Above a nation where grandeur’s adorning,
The flag that’s waving from each seabeat shore;
A beacon e’er to guide us,
Whaterev may betide us,
It led our fathers on to victory—
  I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

CHORUS 1.
It led our fathers on to victory—
I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

2. A home for freemen, where the voice of millions
Awakes each patriots heart with loving pride,
And echoes far to nations long benighted,
The song of peace from each far swelling tide.
Columbia! how we love thee;
Those stars and stripes above thee,
E’er speak to bations of our liberty—
  I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

CHORUS 2.
E’er speak to bations of our liberty—
I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

3. Thise stripes are swelling, and those stars are gleaming,
E’n like a rainbow in the crimson sky,
To guide us onward through each storm that rages
And proudly wave from the battlements high,
That flag will never falter,
Above our nation’s altar,
While one is left to strike for liberty—
  I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

CHORUS 3.
While one is left to strike for liberty—
 I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

4. Then shout Columbia! land bless’d by our fathers,
The brightest, thas has e’er adorn’d the world—
The hand of tyrants never can enslave thee
While floats the starspangled banner unfurl’d,
The land our fathers gave us,
What pow’r can e’er enslave us,
While freemen shout o’er land and over sea—
  I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.

CHORUS 4.
While freemen shout o’er land and over sea—
I am a freeman, I’ll a freeman be.
