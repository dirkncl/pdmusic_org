1. Of all the cheap treasures that garnish my next, 
There’s one that I love and I cherish the best; 
For the finest of couches that’s padded with hair, 
I never would change thee my can bottomed chair. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
’Tis a bandy legged, high shouldered, worm eaten, seat, 
With a creaking old back, and twisted old feet; 
But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there, 
I bless thee and love thee, old cane bottom’d chair, 
But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there, 
I bless thee and love thee, old cane bottom’d chair. 

2. It was but a moment she sat in this place; 
She’d a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face! 
A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair, 
And she sat there and bloom’d, in my cane bottomed chair.

3. If chairs had but feeling, in holding such charms, 
A thrill must have pass’d thro’ your withered old arms; 
I looked and I longed, and I wished in dispair; 
I wished my  self turned to a can bottomed chair.

4. And so I have valued my chair ever since,
Like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince;
Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare,
The queen of my heart, in my cane bottom’d chair.

5. When the candles burn low, and the company’s gone,
In the silence of night as I sit here alone—
I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair—
My Fanny I see in my cane bottom’d chair.

6. She comes from the past and revisits my room,
She looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom,
So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair;
And yonder she sits in my can bottom’d chair.
