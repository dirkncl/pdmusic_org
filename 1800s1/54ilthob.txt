1. I love the heights of Brooklyn,
With its green and shady bowr’s;
The emblem of a fairy land,
How sweet in Summer hours.
The Fair! with grace will always bless
The Isle whereon thou stand,
Thy SONS! in truth and rightousness,
The foremost of the Band.
I 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Love the heights of Brooklyn,
With its green and shady bow’rs;
The emblem of a fairy land—
How sweet in summer hours.

2. Oh where’s the heart that will not feel
When nature’s bright and gay,
The mossy bank yon flow’ry mead
And joys that round them play;
What e’er my lot, my fond desire
Shall ever be with thee
For aye sweet Brooklyn I’ll admire
Tho’ far from her I be.
I
