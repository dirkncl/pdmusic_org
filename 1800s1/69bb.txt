1.
Of all the chaps I ever saw
So jolly and so gay,
I sing of one could give you points
And beat you ev’ry day;
He dress’d himself in gorgeous style
And when a friend he’d meet,
From drinks he never would back out
Although he would retreat.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! yes
He was gay and nob-by;
They call’d him “Bourbon Bobby,”
Like a gay and fest-ive sporter,
He spent his money free,
And none in town could take him down
on a jolly jamboree.

2.
He used to carry lots of scraps
No matter where he went,
And if he knew a friend was poor
He’d give him ev’ry cent;
He was the pet of all the girls
And kept the latest hours.
The reason why he talked so sweet
He lived on Bourbon Sours.

3.
He always smok’d the best cigars
No matter what the cost,
He play’d at “Keno” like a man
And paid up when he lost;
At dinner when he took his seat
He took his little “sip,”
Whenever trouble troubled him
He always let her rip.

4.
He sat behind the fastest nag
Of any on the road.
I tell you what, he always threw
Three aces when he throwed;
In every gay accomplishment
The boy was most complete,
Although quite “reddish” in the nose,
He never was a “beat.”

5.
Oh now I end my little song
About this gay old sport,
Who thought he practiced at the “bar”
Yet never was in “court.”
And as he led a jolly life
Where ever he might be,
And just the happy lad to meet
Upon a jamboree!
