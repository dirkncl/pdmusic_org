1. There was cheer and shout that day,
As we stood in firm array.
And Phil Sheridan he rode along the line,
“Come, my noble lads,” said he,
“We have won the victory.
In a mighty shout and chorus now we join.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Then halt! boys, halt, and give a cheer and shout,
For gallant Grand and Sherman, noble twain!
The old flag we lay it by
And we’ll keep our powder dry.
Till Columbia gives the battle shout again!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Halt! boys, halt, and give a cheer and shout,
For gallant Grant and Sherman, noble twain!
Dear old flag, we lay you by,
And we’ll keep our powder dry.
Till Columbia gives the battle shout again.

2. See those heroes in the sun,
Sherman, Grant, and Sheridan,
With our cannon smoling hot with victory!
And whene’er their trumpets blow,
We will “forward” shout and go.
And our thunder roll from centre to the sea!

3. We will keep our sabers keen,
And we’ll save the old canteen.
And our rifles we will hang them on the wall.
Now, old flag, we lay you by,
And we’ll keep our powder dry.
Till Columbia calls to battle, one and all!
