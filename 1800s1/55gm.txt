1. I love thee gentle maiden, 
For thy merry, merry gladsome face, 
Thy cheek with blushes laden, 
Thy soft and winning grace. 
Thine eyes so full of joyance, 
Thy rosy laughing lip. 
Such lips are an annoyance 
When one can’t take a sip. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
I love theee gentle maiden 
For thy merry, merry gladsome face, 
Thy cheek with blushes laden, 
Thy soft and winning grace.

2. Like silver joybells ringing,
On silent summer day,
Your clear you voice is singing,
Within mine ear alway.
Young love has thrown his witchery
Around me as a spell
With blarney’d brogue the rosy, rogue
Has dosed my heart right well.

3. In sooth the day seems dreary,
Without your sunny smile.
My heart is very weary,
And tho’ I try to wile
It’s thoughts from thee it whispers me,
“Hope” for a brighter day
And tho’ I try to pass it by,
The heart will have its way.
