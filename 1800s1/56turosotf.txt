1. I’m on my way to Canada a freeman’s rights to share.
The cruel wrongs of Slavery I can no longer bear;
My heart is crush’d within me so while I remain a slave.
That I’m resolv’d to strike the blow for Freedom or the Grave!

CHORUS 1
O Great Father! do Thou pity me.
And help me on to Canada where the panting slave is free!

2. I’ve serv’d my Master all my days without the least reward.
And now I’m forc’d to flee away to shun mthe lash abhor’d;
The hounds are braying on my track— My Master’s just behind,
Resolv’d that he will bring me back and fast his fetters bind.

CHORUS 2
O Great Father! do Thou pity me.
And help me on to Canada where the panting slave is free!

3. I’ve heard that Queen Victoria has pledged us all a home
Beyond the reach of Slavery, if we will only come;
So I have fled this weary way, my guide the bright north star,—
And now, thank God, I speed the day in the Underground Railcar.

CHORUS 3
O old Master! why come after me—
I’m whizzing fast to Canada, where the panting slave is free!

4. I now embark for yonder shore, sweet land of liberty,
The vessel soon will bear me o’er, and I shall then be free;
No more I’ll dread the auctioneer, nor fear the Master’s frowns,
No more I’ll tremble lest I hear the baying of the hounds.

CHORUS 4
O old Master, ’tis vain to follow me,
I’m just in sight of Canada, where the panting slave is free!

5. Yes! I am safe in Canada— my soul and body free—
My blood and tears no more shall drench thy soil, O Tennesse!
Yet how can I suppress the tear that’s stealing from my eye,
To think my friends and kindred dear as slaves must live and die.

CHORUS 5
O Great Father! do Thou pity me.
And help me on to Canada where the panting slave is free!
