1. Balmy spring has come gentle Mary,
The sun is beaming warm and bright,
Dreary winter’s gloom gentle Mary
Has vanished like the star of night,
The little songsters in the trees, love,
Have caught the lark’s shrill piercing notes,
Their music fills the passing breeze love,
And on the sweet air floats. 

2. We will rove where bright streamlets glide love,
Where wild flow’wrs seek in peace to bloom,
We will strip the heathbell of its pride love
And rob earth of its rich perfume,
Then welcome balmy spring’s return Mary,
With gladsome songs and tuneful voice
We’ll trip blithely o’er the flow’ry prairie,
And with the lark rejoice.
