1.
Oh, bonnie Katie Strang,
Could I turn my heart to words,
I would warble thee a song
Maie braw that ony birds;
For thy dainty, dearie face
Into pleasure turns my pain,
For 'tis fresh and full of grace
As a gowan after rain,
For 'tis fresh and full of grace
As a gowan after rain.

2.
Where the bonnie bosky burn,
Doth wimple wild, I'll woo,
And wi' ladder leaves o' fern,
I would crown thee, lassie true,
With the flowers of the shaw
And the purple heather bells,
And ev'ry blossom braw,
That bedecks the darksome dells,
And ev'ry blossom braw,
That bedecks the darksome dells.

3.
Then wilt thou thither gang
To the woody, flower'd glen?
Oh, bonnie Katie Strang,
I've a tale to tell thee then;
When the Summer stars shall gleam,
And the mavis cease his song,
Wilt thou meet me by the stream,
Dainty darling, Katie Strang?
Wilt thou meet me by the stream,
Dainty darling, Katie Strang?
