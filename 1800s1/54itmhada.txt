1.Oft in that calm and gentle hour
When sunset gilds the drooping flow’r
I love beside my lattice green
To watch the fairy fading scene
Till fancy’s visions bright and gay
Replace the sunny smile of day,
Oh! then to some remember’d strain
I touch my harp and dream again,
I touch my harp, and dream again,
I touch my harp, and dream again!

2. I think of those fond days so dear
When ev’ry flow’r that grew was fair,
When oft I roam’d the forest free
And watch’d the sweet bird on the tree.
When all around me fondly smil’d
As I lov’d all a simple child!
Oh! still to that remember’d strain
I touch my harp, and dream again!
I touch my harp, and dream again!
I touch my harp, and dream again!
