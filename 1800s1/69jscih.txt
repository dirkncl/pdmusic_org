1. Beard as white as driven snow, 
 Nose as red as red can be; 
Clad in furs from top to toe, 
 Lips that whistle merrily; 
Here and there he goes his round, 
 Up and greet him with a cheer! 
Heeping pack upon his back, 
 Jolly Santa Claus is here! 

[CHORUS (sung after each verse]
Trumpets, whips and drums and noise! 
Tops and dolls and puzzles queer; 
Jumping jacks and other joys, 
Jolly Santa Claus is here!
Jolly Santa Claus is here! 
Jolly Santa Claus is here!

2. Hung around the chimney side
 See the stockings in a row,
In each one some toys he’ll hide,
 Then upon his tramp he’ll go;
“Lots of places yet to call.”
 Now he nods and winks his eye;
Up the chimney, down the wall,
 Off he goes and shouts “goodbye!”

3. “Merry christmas o you all!”
 This he shouts while driving on;
“And next year again I’ll call,”
 In a wink away he’s gone.
Shall our greeting now be cold
 Tho’ he calls but once a year?
Friend of yound and friend of old,
 Jolly Santa Claus is here!
