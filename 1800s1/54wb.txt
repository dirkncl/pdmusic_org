1.
Down yonder shadowed valley,
Where the death tide's waters roll,
Where dark phantoms ever daily
With the fleeting, fainting soul;
Where the hymn of death is waking,
In he gloom with measured swell;
Thither went, our heart strings breaking,
Littly, loving, Willie Bell.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Gentle Willie; Darling Willie;
How we lov'd thee none can tell;
Thou hast left us and forever,
Little, loving, Willie Bell.

2.
All the springtime played he gladly,
With the sunbeams from the sky,
In the summer watched he sadly,
All the Spring-flowers fade and die,
And he wander'd by the brooklet
Where the gushing waters fell,
Where the Angels sung at night-tide,
Music low to Willie Bell.

3.
But, when summer blossoms faded,
  And the Autumn leaves flew by;
When the gentle buds were shaded
  By the snow-wreaths from on high--
Then a voice came down from Heaven,
  Like the waves in winding shell,
And the Angel Crown was given
  To the brow of Willie Bell.

4.
Folded they his hands of whiteness,
  O'er the marble, lifeless breast;
While sweet strains from Harps of brightness
  Welcomed him to heavenly rest,
And the eyes of blue were closing,
  O'er the cheek where death damps fell,
While in dreamless sleep reposing
  Was the form of Willie Bell.

5.
Down within the grassy meadow,
  Down within the silent vale,
Where at even comes the shadow
  of the moonbeams, still and pale;
There, upon the earth's cold bosom
  'Mid the snowflakes as they fell,
Laid we our bright summer-blossom,
  Lov'd in death, sweet Willie Bell!
