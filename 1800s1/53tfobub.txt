VERSE
There's for-tune on be-fore us, boys,
We'll seek it day by day,
And if we strive and per-se-vere,
'Twill meet us half the way;

With toil-ful brow and stal-wart arm,
We've sought it far and near,
Oh ne-ver let our cou-rage fail,
but strive and per-se-vere!

There's for-tune on be-fore us, boys,
We'll seek it day by day,
And if we strive and per-se-vere
'Twill meet us half the way.

CHORUS
There's for-tune on be-fore us, boys,
We'll seek it day by day,
And if we strive and per-se-vere,
'Twill meet us half the way!
