Hark to the lay of the Carrier Dove, 
Of knightly faith and woman’s love: 
As sung in days of yore 
By a gay young Troubadour, 
By a gay young Troubadour. 

While before St. Agnes’ shrine, 
Knelt a true knight’s ladylove, 
From the wars of Palestine 
Came a gentle Carrier dove; 
Round his neck a silken string 
Round the words the warrior writ; 
At her call he stoop’d his wing, 
And upon her finger lit. 

She like one enchanted pored 
O’er the heart cherish’d scroll, 
For that lady lov’d her lord 
With a pure devoted soul. 
To her heart the dove she drew 
While she traced the burning line 
Then away his minton flew 
Back to Sainted Palestine, 
to Palestine, to Palestine. 

To and fro from land to land 
Came and went a Carrier dove, 
Till throughout the holy land 
War resigned his sword to Love. 
Swift her dove on wings of light 
Brought the news from Palestine, 
And the Lady her true Knight 
Wedded at St. Agnes’ shrine. 

Thus ends the lay of the Carrier dove, 
Of knightly fame and woman’s love; 
As sung in days of yore 
By a gay young Troubadour, 
By a gay young Troubadour, 
By a gay young Troubadour.
