1. Lonely, starved, at midnight dreary, 
Ragged Katy, faint and wea ry, 
On the sidewalk, in our City, 
Half sang, half wept, for hours, this ditty.

CHORUS 1
Hot corn! Hot corn! 
Who’ll buy my hot corn, 
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.

2. A drunken mother’s threat rememb’ring, 
If the corn she sold not, trembling, 
As each one her basket came by, 
Katy urged that piteous same cry.

CHORUS 2
Hot corn! Hot corn! 
Who’ll buy my Hot corn, 
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.

3. A ruffian drunkard, swearing, swaggering,
Towards the trembler, bravely staggering,
Little whelp of a she wolf born,
“Give me,” cried he, “an ear of corn.”

CHORUS 3
Hot corn! Hot corn!
Here’s your Hot corn.
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.

4. A rich man homeward, his way wending,
By the lone child, his steps bending,
His thoughts on gain, the hour was late, he
Heeded not the prayer of Katy,

CHORUS 4
Hot corn! Hot corn!
Pray, buy my Hot corn.
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.

5. If, to feed a mother’s vices,
Their fair girl, then, guilt entices,
With sinful wages, to all shame die,
At whose door, pray, will the blame lie?

CHORUS 5
Hot! corn, Hot corn!
Do, buy my Hot corn,
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.

6. Statesmen, Fathers, Christian, Freemen,
Loving God and country, be men!
Dare the issue, Bless our nation,
Crush this Giant Desolation!

CHORUS 6
Hot corn! Hot corn!
Who’ll buy my Hot corn.
Hot corn, Hot corn, smoking hot corn.
