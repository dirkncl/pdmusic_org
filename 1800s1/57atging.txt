1. When but a heedless child I stray’d,
Upon the ocean’s strand,
And gather’d many pearly shells,
From ’mong the glist’ning sand:
But not content I cast them off,
And sought for treasures yet untold;
But ah! with blighted hopes I learn’d,
That

[CHORUS/REFRAIN 1 and 2]
all that glitters is not gold,
That all that glitters is not gold.

2. ’Tis thus we leave sweet joys for those
We fancy others know;
How prone to judge that they feel naught,
Of earthly care or woe,
Yet if we could behold their hearts,
And they their secrets would unfold;
We’d plainly see engraven there,
That

3. Then let us seek that happiness
Contentment only gives,
With willing hands and cheerful hearts,
The joy that ever lives;
Tho’ humble be our lot in life;
Tho’ fortune should her hand withold;
We still may smile and happy be,
For 

[CHORUS/REFRAIN 3]
all that glitters is not gold,
For all that glitters is not gold.
