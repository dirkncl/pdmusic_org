1. My heart is caught in Cupid’s net 
And never can go free, 
All by the sweetest little pet 
That mortal eyes may see. 
Her cheeks are like the roses red 
That bloom down in the dell, 
And when we met O what she said 
I wouldn’t like to tell! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
She’s just the best and sweetest, 
The gayest and completest, 
I love her so, I love her so, 
Her smile’s a fairy spell; 
But who she is, my darling, O! 
I wouldn’t like to tell.

2. I’ve roam’d with her in summer days 
Down by the rippling stream, 
And O I thought her lovely face 
Was like a pleasant dream, 
I ask’d her if my heart she’d share, 
Her modest eyes they fell; 
But what she softly whisper’d there 
I wouldn’t like to tell!

3. I’m happy as the birds of spring 
No matter where I go, 
And merry thoughts around me cling, 
I love my darling so! 
Our wedding bells will soon be heard, 
I know that very well; 
But when we’ll wed upon my word 
I wouldn’t like to tell!
