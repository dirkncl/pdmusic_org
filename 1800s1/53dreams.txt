1. Oh! I have had dreams, I have had sweet dreams, 
Of childhood’s bright and many hours, 
When I wander’d all day, by the sparkling streams, 
And call’d for my mother, the gay wild flow’rs. 
When I wore her a wreath of the green woodbine, 
And twin’d in it berries and violets gay! 
And I crown’d her pale forehead and she kiss’d mine, 
Ah! she like the flowers has faded away, 
She has faded away, faded away!

2. I have had bright dreams of the old elm tree, 
Beneath whose branches spreading wide, 
I have sported away in childish glee, 
The fleetwing’d hours of the eventide. 
I have dream’d of the friends once gather’d there, 
To frolic away the long summer’s day, 
Untrammel’d by fear, unwearied by care, 
But they like the rest have faded away, 
They have faded away, fad ed away!

3. I have had bright dreams, as I’ve wand’rd alone,
When still midnight in silence reign’d;
When my own pale star, shone bright from its throne,
And in visions of hope my soul was chain’d.
But the cares of earth would come again,—
The heart would grow sick with hope’s delay,
And the visions I wove of my destiny then,
Ah! they like the rest have faded away,
They have faded away, faded away!

4. I have had sweet dreams of a fairy form,
That was ever around me there,
Of her birdlike voice, with its silvery charm,
Floating away on the evening air.
But alas for the flush of the wasting breath,
Alas for thy terrible power decay!
An angel beckoned her home from the earth,—
Like the morning star she has faded away,
She has faded away, faded away.
