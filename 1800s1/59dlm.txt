1. Little Minnie was a blessing
With her bright and laughing face.
With her gentle ways caressing
And her form so full of grace.
And we loved her, oh, how dearly!
For she was a ray of light
That shone so bright and cheerly
And fill’d us with delight.
  That shone so bright and cheerly
  And fill’d us with delight. 

2. But the light grew faint before us,
And, at least forgot to shine,
And appear’d in Heaven o’er us,
With a radiance all sublime.
Little Minnie was to leave us,
She our hope, our joy and pride.
And how sadly did we grieve us
When she droop’d away and died
  And how sadly did we grieve us
  When she droop’d away and died.

3. Now a shadow drear is falling
On the home she used to grace.
Every object still recalling
To our hearts her merry face.
But it will not last forever;
In that happier home above
We shall meet no more to sever
In a pure eternal love.
  We shall meet no more to sever
  In a pure eternal love.
