1.
Softly ye night winds that float o’er my brow 
Whisper he thinks of me, dreams of me now; 
Tell me my thoughts cheer him onward to fame. 
Tell me when sleeping, he murmurs my name. 
Say not his fond arms another entwine. 
Say not he breathes her the vows that were mine. 
Say not he breathes her the vows that were mine.

2. Lonely, I pine for his coming in vain,
Pine as the night pines for morning again,
Yet the fond thought that my lover is true
Falls on my spirit like sunlight on dew
Then let me hope and in fragrance and bloom
Fade like the lily, and die mid perfume,
Fade like the lily, and die mid perfume.
