1. 
Thou hast seen the white rose growing 
’Mid the moonbeams and the dew, 
Thou hast heard the wild brook flowing 
And have caught its glance of blue; 
But purer than the white rose, 
Or streams that sing at even, 
Was my Mary—- darling Mary! 
’Till she Pass’f away to Heaven, 
Was my Mary—- darling Mary! 
’Till she Pass’d away tp Heaven. 

2. 
In the cottage by the wildwood 
Was her sweet hand placed in mine, 
When our love was in its childhood 
And we knew not how to pine; 
Methought a holy angel 
To me that hour was given, 
In my Mary—- gentle Mary! 
Who has Pass’d away to Heaven,
In my Mary—- gentle Mary! 
Who has Pass’d away to Heaven.

3. 
Years have fled, and I am grieving
O’er the spot where Mary lies,
And my heart with sighs is heaving,
And the tears are in my eyes;
But I wait with pain and sadness
’Till these earthly ties are riven,
Then I’ll meet my Angel Mary!
Who has Pass’d away to Heaven,
Then I’ll meet my Angel Mary!
Who has Pass’d away to Heaven.
