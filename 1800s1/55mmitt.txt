1.
Music Murm'rings in the Trees
Where the sunbeam glances bright,
Lingeres on the morning breeze
With a glad delight;
And the bird on yonder bough
That o'erhangs the streamlet's brink,
Singing flutters here below
At the marge to drink.

QUARTETTE or CHORUS
Here the redman roam'd of old;
Here he chased the wildwood deer,
Here his tale of love he told
To the Indian maiden's ear,--
Told his love at days repoase
To his forest rose.

2.
Music Murm'rings thus of yore
Floated thro' forest here,
But beneath the boughs no more
Bounds the hunted deer;
And the wigwam in the grove
Stand no longer 'mid the trees,
But the tender tones of love
Linger in the breeze.

QUARTETTE or CHORUS
When the streamlet gently flows
From the noontide sun depart,
Here he lov'd awhile repose
And the murm'rings of my heart,
Let me tenderly disclose
To my forest rose.
