1. They come, they come, the freemen host, 
Let all the land rejoice; 
I see their banner’s stripes and stars, 
I hear the Nor’lands voice. 
’Tis God who speeds the conquerer, 
The God of Liberty; 
Then let us shout, all hail the voice; 
The Nor’land’s voice Be Free!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We’re freemen now, we’re freemen now, 
and we’ll be free alway; 
We’re freemen now, we’re freemen now, 
Hurra! Hurra! Hurra!

2. And let us swear by all the blood, 
That cries from out the ground, 
That we will keep inviolate 
The freedom we have found.
No more as slaves we’ll till the soil, 
No more as slaves we’ll bow; 
As freemen only will we toil, 
For we are free men now!
