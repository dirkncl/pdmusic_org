[CHORUS sung before each verse]
Fling wide the Banner, Boys,
Fling wide the Banner;
For Noble Grant, the people's choice,
Shout aloud Hosanna!

1.
All doubt will ever pass away,
With Grant the brave we'll wind the day,
In hime the nation put their trust,
They heeded not each slander,
Thrown out against the good and just,
Brave Grant, Our Great Commnander.

2.
When the nation's life hung on a thread,
When all around was gloom and dead,
Who was it rais'd each drooping head,
And taught us not to pander
With foreign or domestic foes?
'Twas Grant, Our Great Commander.

3.
Who gave our arms their first success,
And made the foe in numbers less?
Fort Donalson was first to yield,
And forced to a surrender;
Who was it won that Glorious field?
'Twas Grant, Our Great Commander.

4.
Who storm'd the works on Vicksburg's height,
When Freedom in her morning's light
Dispell'd the gloom of Treason's night,
And made the foe surrender,
Just on our Glorious Natal day?
'Twas Grant, Our Great Commander.

5.
Who made Our Country's foemen reel,
And bend their stubborn wills of steel,
And in repentance lean to feel
That God was with Our Banner?
That man will be Our President,
Brave Grant, Our Great Commander.

6.
When Rebellion's sun went down,
And justice played her laurel crown
Upon the brow of him who won
The name of the Defender;
Who bid the Bloody Conflict cease?
'Twas Grant, Our Great Commander.

7.
Come Soldiers, Sailors, Freemen, all,
Can you resist your Country's call?
Don't for a moment hesitate,
Come forth with truth and candor,
Vote for the man who saved the State,
For Grant, Our Great Commander.
