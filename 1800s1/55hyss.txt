1. I floated down the river
  On the schooner Polly Ann;
I landed on York Island,
  A very verdant man;
I gather’d up my baggage
  In a shocking crowd and jam,
When a fellow jump’d before me saying
  “Have you seen Sam”?

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I don’t know Sam,
  I don’t know Sam,
Confound this noise and bother
  Who is this fellow Sam?

2. I thought the fellow crazy,
  And fled before the wind:
The Astor rose before me,
  My coat tail stream’d behind:
Soon up the steps I scrambled,
  And shouted “Here I am”
Another fellow tapp’d me
  And ask’d “Have you seen Sam?”

3. I then went straight to Barnum’s
  To see the mighty show:
The Shanghais and the Babies,
  How loudly they did crow!
I stood and gaz’d about me,
  To see if ’twas a sham:
I smooth’d the bearded lady’s cheek,
  She sigh’d “Have you seen Sam”?

4. I hunted through each corner,
  Till nearly out of breath:
I ask’d about the wooly horse,
  The mermaid and Joice Beth;
Men laugh’d, the Shanghais cackled,
  I left old Captain Sham:
And as I turn’d to leave the place,
  The monkey’s chatter’d Sam!

5. I went up to Albany,
  To see the wires at play:
Twas pulling here twice bawling there
  Has Sam been here today?
To Washingtin I went to see,
  The Senatorial jam:
I told them of the war in York,
  The ask’d if I’d seen Sam?

6. I told them horns and bugles blew
  A fearful— warlike blast:
That crotchets quavers, fiddles flew
  In bloodless conflict past:
The fifers scream’d their piercing notes,
  The drummer’s beat their flam:
While high above the noise and din,
  The cry was “Where is Sam”?

7. I’m going up the river,
  My purse is running down:
No matter whom I chance to meet,
  That ask if Sam’s in town:
It’s Sam around above me,
  In Croton or in dram:
With luck, I’m off to morrow,
  Who is this fellow Sam?
