1. Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I have left in tears, 
From friends that I’ve not seen for years; 
And since we parted long ago, 
My life has been a scene of woe, 
But now a joyful hour has come, 
For I have heard good news from home: 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I have left in tears, 
From friends that I’ve not seen for years.

2. No Father’s near to guide me now,
No Mother’s tear to soothe my brow,
No Sister’s voice falls on mine ear,
Nor Brother’s smile to give me cheer;
But tho’ I wander far away,
My heart is full of joy today,
For friends (across the ocean’s foam,)
Have sent to me good news from home:

3. When shall I see that cottage door,
Where I’ve spent years of joy before,
’Twas then I knew no grief or care,
My heart was always happy there;
Though I may never see it more,
Nor stand upon my native shore,
Where e’er on earth I’m doom’d to roam
My heart will be with those at home.
