1. 
Yes I know that you once were my lover, 
But that sort of thing has an end. 
Though love and its transports are over, 
You know you can still be my friend. 
I was young then and foolish remember,--
Did you ever hear John Hardy sing? 
It was then the fifteenth of November, 
But this is the end of the spring.

2. 
You complain that you were not well treated 
By my suddenly altering so, 
Can I help it! you’re very conceited 
If you think yourself equal to Jo; 
Don’t kneel at my feet I implore you, 
Don’t write on the drawings you bring, 
Don’t ask me to say I adore you, 
For indeed it is now no such thing.

3.
I confess when at Bogner we parted,
I vowed that I worshipped you then,
That I was a maid broken hearted,
And you the most charming of men;
I confess when I read your first letter
I blotted your name with a tear,
But Oh! I was young-- knew no better
Could I tell I would meet Hardy here?

4.
Dear me! how you fret-- how you worry,
Repeating my vows to be true,
If I said so, I told you a story,
For I love Hardy better than you;
Yes! my fond heart is fixed on another,
I sigh so whenever he's gone,
I still love you indeed as a brother,
But my heart is John Hardy's alone.
