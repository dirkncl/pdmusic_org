1. Within the trembling Lily, bells 
Beneath their leaves so green, 
Full many a merry fairy dwells, 
By mortal eyes  unseen;
And yet, sometimes at evening hour 
I’ve heard a mystic strain, 
Of music creep from flow’r to flower, 
Sung by that elfin  train.

[REFRAIN for verses 1 and 2]
Within the trembling lily bells, 
Beneath their leaves so green, 
Full many a merry fairry dwells, 
By  mortal eyes unseen.

2. In all my changeful moods they seem, 
An echo still to find;
Their voices haunt me like a dream, 
Borne on the sumner wind;
They breathe an ans’ring blissful tone 
When hearts with hope beat high, 
And when dejections blight we own, 
They give back sigh for sigh.

3. Those ivery petals vibrate oft, 
When every breeze is still, 
’Tis fairy laughter clear and soft 
Their snowy cups which thrill;
But when the blossoms fade and fall 
in withering decay, 
You’ll hear those  elfin minstrells call, 
Come, come away.

[REFRAIN]
Fall’n are aour beaueous Lily bells, 
Soil’d are her leaves so green, 
The bee has rifled all her cells, 
Farewell sweet lily Queen.
