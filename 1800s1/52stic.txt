1. Spring time is coming all laden with flow’rs, 
Spreading her mantle of green o’er the bow’rs 
The lark high in air is he ginning to sing 
Her song of rejoicing to welcome the spring. 

Brooks are flowing, 
Life bestowing, 
Lovely nature seems to fling 
All her charms 
With willing arms 
In the lap of blooming spring. 

2. Spring time is coming all lasen with flow’rs, 
Spreading her mantle of green o’er the bow’rs, 
The lark high in air is beginning to sing 
Her song of rejoicing to welcome the spring. 

Brooks  are flowing, 
Life bestowing, 
Lovely nature seems to fling 
All her charms, 
With willing arms, 
In the lap of blooming spring. 

3. Silver-hair’d winter before her is flying 
In the depths of the valley unwept he is dying 
Save the tears of compassion which pity may wring 
From the bright eyes of April, the infant of Spring. 

Birds are mating, 
Bliss relating 
In each tuneful strain they sing, 
Haste then dearest 
Love seems nearest, 
Holiest, brightest in the spring.

In the depths of the valley unwept he is dying, 
Save the tears of compassion which pity may bring 
From the bright eyes of April, the infant of Spring. 

Birds are mating, 
Bliss relating 
In each tuneful strain they sing 
Haste then dearest, 
Love seems nearest, 
Holiest, brightest in the spring.
