1.
In South Car'lina de darkies go
  Sing song Kitty cant you ki' me oh!
Dats whar de white folks plant de tow
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me, oh!
Cover de ground all over wid smoke
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me, oh!
And up de darkies heads dey poke
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh

CHORUS
Keemo Ki'mo! -- Dar! oh whar?
Wid my hi, my ho, and in come Sally singing
Some times penny winkle, lingtum, nipcat --
Sing song Kitty cant you ki' me oh.

2.
Milk in de dairy nine days old,
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh.
Frogs and de skeeters getting mighty bold--
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh!
Dey try for to sleep but it ain't no use
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh.
Dere legs hang out for de chickens to roost
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh!

(CHORUS)

3.
Dar was a frog lived in a pool,
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh!
Sure he was de biggest fool--
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh!
For he could dance and he could sing
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh!
And make de woods around him ring
  Sing song Kitty cant you Ki' me oh.

(CHORUS)
