1. I dream, I dream of my Fatherland,
As fancy my slumber beguiles,
Where the spell of beauty each heart enthralls,
Where the home of my childhood smiles.
Ah yes! I dream of wealth and pow’r,
The wildest of visions could will
But I wake to the truth in afflictions hour,
Of the heart that loves me still I dream,

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
I dream of my Fatherland,
I dream of my Fatherland. I dream,
I dream of my Fatherland,
I dream of my Fatherland.

2. I dream of bright eyes where affection beams,
While thine shall with pleasure be bright;
And hearts that realize fancy’s dreams,
While thine is with happiness light;
Many, while fortune her gifts hath spread,
Around me, are slaves of my will,
But there is one when all shall have fled,
That will love me, love me.
