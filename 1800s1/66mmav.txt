1. O’er my cradle, years ago, one well remembered form
Would watch with love so tenderly my young life’s early morn;
Unto her arms of others all to go, ’twould be my choice,
Then singing soft and low, I’d hear my Angel Mother’s voice.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Music pealing on the air, when vesper bells rejoice,
Never yet could be compared to Moth’er’s Angel voice.

2. Years roll by, and often comes the tempter to beguile,
I recolect those Lessons taught to me while but a child;
And on the brink I’ve wav’ring stood when wrong would seem the choice,
But just in time to save, would come me Angel’s Mother’s voice.

3. Many, many Suns have set, quite gray my Locks have grown
Since mother laid her down to sleep— bright angels took her home;
And till the time shall come when I will meet her and rejoice,
There’s naught on earth will be to me like Angel Mother’s voice.
