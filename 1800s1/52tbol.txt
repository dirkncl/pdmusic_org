1.
I spose you've heard of Jenny Lind,
She came here in a Steamer,
Some call her sweedish nightingale,
And some a mighty screamer.
Old Barnum brought her ober here,
To beat our Whippoorwill;
But he must try again to beat
The Belle of Louisville.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! my Felin she can sing,
De echo wid de Violin;
Her voice is sweet like de Whippoorwill,
Oh! she's the Belle of Louisville.
Her teeth are white, (Her eyes are black,)
(Her face is blacker still,)
Oh, how I love my sweet Felin,
De Belle of Louisville.

2.
De next dat come from ober dar,
Was a gall dey call Perodi,
She hir'd some fiddlers ober here,
And gave a roaring Soiree;
We thought 'twas good untill we heard,
Dat she was Jenny's rival,
But den we gib her up for lost,
Her fame went to the dibal.

3.
De next dat come wes Katy Hays
She pleases the New Yorkers,
We understand her Irish lays
Are good, and nothing shorter.
Dey say her voice is like a swan,
Dey call her Swan of Erin,
De music of dat floating bird
I dont remember hearing.

4.
Dars another gall from old Kentuck,
I know dat she sings well,
I dont believe that she can sing,
Wid de Belle of Louisville.
Dey do not call her any bird,
De call her Blamowitze,
She make de people clap dar hands,
And sings dem all to fitz.

5.
Dars Anna Bishop sings so sweet,
Her singing it is perfect,
We understand just what she sings,
Wid no one to interpret.
But my Felin, she's the Queen,
A perfect Whipperwill,
A Bobbilink, and Mocking bird,
Is de Belle of Louisville.
