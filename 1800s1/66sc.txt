1. Up on the housetop, reindeer pause,
Out jumps good old Santa Claus.
Down thru the chimney with lots of toys,
All for the little ones, Christmas joys.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn’t go!
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick?

2. Fist comes the stocking of little Nell;
Oh, dear Santa, fill it well;
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries,
One that will open and shut her eyes.

3. Next comes the stocking of little Will.
Oh, just see that glorrious fill.
Here is a hammer, and lots of tracks,
Also a ball, and a whip that cracks.
