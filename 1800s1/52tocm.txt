1. De home of my childhood dat dearly loved spot,
Whar de yallow corn am growing roun my fader’s old cot,
Dar many happy days I spent I yet remember well,
Wid my kind old mudder down by de old Cornmill.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Den hurry me home to de old Corn mill,
To my fader’s old cot on de top of de hill,
For I am getting weary and not afraid to die.
Oh lay me side my mudder in de groun whar Katy lie.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Den hurry me home to de old Corn mill,
To my fader’s old cot on de top of de hill,
For I am getting weary and not afraid to die,
Oh lay me side my mudder in de groun whar Katie lie.

2. Full well I remember how with boyish delight,
We met roun de pineknot fires at de night,
I lub to see de old corn mill and watch de wheel go round,
I lub my good old mudder in de cold cold ground.

3. Oh for dat old corn mill to memory dear
I would eat de bright corn cake wid merry good cheer,
But de old corn mill am passing away
And de crazy old wheel am gone to decay.

4. And Katy I loved, her grave am so cold,
De old folks am dead an de young ones am sold,
Dem happy days am ober free from sorrow and ill,
When we all lived at home by de old corn mill.
