1. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered
On the grass the moonlight fell
Hush'd the sound of daylight bustle
Closed the pink eyed pimpernell
As adown the moss grown wood path
Where the cattle love to roam
From an august evening party
I was seeing Nelly home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
In the sky the bright stars glittered
On the grass the moonlight shone
From an august evening party
I was seeing Nelly home.

2. 
When the autumn tinged the greenwood
Turning all its leaves to gold
In the lawn by elders shaded
I my love to Nelly told
As we stood together gazing
On the star bespangled dome
How I blessed the august evening
When I saw sweet Nelly home.

3. 
White hairs mingled with my tresses
Furrows steal upon my brow
But a love smile cheers and blesses
Life's declining moments now
Matron in the snowy kerchief
Closer to my bosom come
Tell me do'st thou still remember
When I saw sweet Nelly home?
