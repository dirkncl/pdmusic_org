1. Father in heaven! We bow to thee, 
Poor humble insects of the sod, 
And own thee as the source of all— 
The only true and living God! 

2. The countless worlds that roll through space 
In spheric hymns proclaim 
That thou art King and Lord of all— 
O! hallowed be thy name! 

3. Imprisoned in this dark state, 
As exile from his home 
We blindly grope through doubt and sin— 
Oh! let thy Kingdom come!

4. Against thy just and holy laws
Our foolish souls have striven;
Oh Father! let thy will be done
On earth as ’tis in Heaven.

5. With earthly wants, and low desires,
Our angelnatures starved and dead,
We call on thee as helpless babes—
Give us this day our daily bread.

6. With contrite hearts, and pleasing sighs,
We fall before thy throne;
As we forgive a brother’s sins,
Oh, God! forgive our own!

7. Let not the wily tempter’s art
Seduce our erring souls from thee
But save us from all evil, Lord!
In time and in Eternity.

8. Almighty God! to thee is due
The gloty of the earth and Heaven;
All praise, all faith, and holiest love,
To thee, Oh, Lord! alone is given.
