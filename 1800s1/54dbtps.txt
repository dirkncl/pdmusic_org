1. 
[1st Voice]
Down by the pebbly shore 
Wash’d by the dark blue sea 
When moonlight comes once more. 
There Sister come to me, 
Come to me, come to me, 
Sister come to me. 
[2nd Voice]
Down by the pebbly shore. 
Merry and blithe we’ll be, 
Bringing back days of yore, 
Spite of dull reality 
Days of yore, days of yore, 
Spite of dull reality. 
Happy days,
[DUET]
Happy days 
Down by the pebble shore 
Watching the golden rays 
Fond mem ’ries will restore 
Of girlhood’s happy days. 
Sister come, Sister come, 
Down by the pebbly shore. 
Sister come, Sister come, 
Down, down by the pebbly shore. 

2. 
[1st Voice]
Down by the pebbly shore. 
Watching the mystic deep, 
Dear Tales we’ll tell once more. 
Sweet girlhood’s vigils keep 
Fond Tales we’ll tell once more. 
Sweet girlhood’s vigils keep. 
[2nd Voice]
Watching the mystic deep, 
Dear Tales we’ll tell once more. 
Sweet girlhood’s vigils keep 
Fond Tales we’ll tell once more. 
Sweet girlhood’s vigils keep. 
Happy day,
[DUET]
Happy days 
Down by the pebble shore 
Watching the golden rays 
Fond mem ’ries will restore 
Of girlhood’s happy days. 
Sister come, Sister come, 
Down by the pebbly shore. 
Sister come, Sister come, 
Down, down by the pebbly shore.
