1. She is is a winsome wee thing,
She is a handsome wee thing,
She is a bonnie wee thing,
This sweet wee wife of mine.
I ne’er saw a fairer, I ne’er lo’ed a dearer,
And ne’rst my heart I’ll wear her,
For fear my jewel tine ah

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
She is a winsome wee thing,
She is a winsome wee thing,
She is a bonnie wee thing,
This sweet wee thing wife wife of mine.

2. She is is a winsome wee thing,
She is a handsome wee thing,
She is a bonnie wee thing,
This sweet wee wife of mine.
The worlds wrack we’ll share o’t,
The wrestle and the care o’t,
With her I’ll blythly hear it,
And think my lot divine ah
