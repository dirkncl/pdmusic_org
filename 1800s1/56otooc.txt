1. Oh, the old, old clock, of the household stock, 
Was the brightest thing, and the neatest; 
Its hands tho’ old, has a touch of gold, 
And its chime rang still the sweetest; 
And its chime rang still the sweetest; 
’Twas a monitor too tho¹ its words were few, 
Yet they lived tho’ the nations alter’d, 
And its voice still strong warn’d old, and young 
When the voice of friendship falter’d. 
Tick! tick! tick! tick! tick! tick!  it said, 
quick, quick to bed, 
For ten I’ve given warning, 
Up, up and go, or else you know, 
You’ll never rise soon in the morning.

2. A friendly voice was the old, old clock,
As it stood in the corner smiling,
And bless’d the time with a merry chime,
The Win’try hours beguiling,
The Win’try hours beguiling;
But a cross old voice was that tirecome clock,
As it call’d at daybreak boldly,
When the dawn look’d gray o’er the misty way,
And the early air blew coldly—
Tick! tick! tick! tick!
tick! tick! it said,
quick out of bed,
For five I’ve given warning,
You’ll never have health,
you’ll never have wealth,
Unless you’re up soon in the morning.

3. Still hourly the sound goes round and round,
With a tale that ceases never;
While tears are shed for bright days fled,
And the old friends lost forever,
And the old friends lost forever,
Its heart beats on, tho’ hearts are gone,
That once were even stranger,
Its hands still move tho’ hands we love,
Are clasp’d on earth no longer!
Tick! tick! tick! tick!
tick! tick! it said,
to the churchyard bed,
The grave hath given warning;
Up, up and rise, and look at the skies,
And prepare for a heav’nly morning.
