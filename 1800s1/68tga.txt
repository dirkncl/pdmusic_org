1.
[Tutti]
Now the Union our forefathers left us,
Still as firm as a rock shall remain,
And tho’ traitors and foes may assail it,
No power can rend it in twain!
[SOLO]
For the spirit that lived in our fathers,
[Tutti[
Still exists in each true loyal son,
And we’ll come when we’re call’d to the rescue,
With the Banner of Many in One! ah!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
In the Grand Army of the Republic!
As comrades we clasp handinhand,
And we march to the music of Freedom,
And the motto:— “May God bless our land!”

2,
[Tutti]
Now we swear by the shades of the heroes,
Who have perish’d in liberty’s cause!
That we, living, will still do our duty,
And standby our comrades and laws!
[Solo]
We will honor the graves of our patroits,
[Tutti]
And their names shall be cherish’d with love,—
We will boast of their deeds to our children,
While we point to our Banner above! ah!

3.
[Tutti]
And if traitors should once more assemble,
To stain this fair land with our gore,
Then with stout hearts and hands ever faithful,
We’ll fight them to death, as before!
[Solo]
For the states shall go on in their greatness,
[Tutti]
As a star shining over the sea,
To give light to all nations in bondage,
And to lead them to sweet Liberty! ah!
