1. Girl of the forehead fair,
  Aileen, aroon!
Girl of the raven hair,
  Aileen, aroon!
Girl of the laughing eye,
Blue as the cloudless sky,
For thee I pine and sigh,
  Aileen, aroon.

2. Girl of the winning tongue,
  Aileen, aroon!
Flow’r of our maidens young,
  Aileen, aroon!
Sad was our parting day,
Fast flowed my tears away,
Cold was my heart as clay,
  Aileen, aroon.

3. Come ere the grave will close,
  Aileen aroon!
O’er me and all my woes,
  Aileen, aroon!
Come with the love of old,
True as the tested gold,
Pet lamb of all the fold,
  Aileen, aroon!

4.  By the strand of the sea,
  Aileen, aroon!
Still I’ll keep watch for thee,
  Aileen, aroon!
There with fond love I’ll hie,
Looking with tearfull eye,
For thee until I die,
  Aileen, aroon!
