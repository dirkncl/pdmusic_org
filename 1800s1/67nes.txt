1. They are sleeping, sweetly sleeping,
Where the Skies are soft and mild
Where the flow’rs are ever blooming
In their beauty pure  and wild
Where the grass is freshly springing
O’er their lonely narrow grave.
There New England’s Sons are lying
Where the orange branches wave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
They’re sleeping yes, they’re sweetly sleeping
While in peace their souls shall be
For they died to save our country
And the banner of the free.

2. There the birds are ever singing,
And the gentle zephyrs play,
Softly round the spot so sacred
Where our gallant soldiers lay,
And the sun in noonday brightness,
Seems to shine in milder beams.
And the ling’ring rays of twilight
Sheds o’er them its holiest gleams.

3. They have fallen, bravely fallen,
In dedence of truth and right
And their names are left untar nish’d,
Free from treason’s stain and blight.
Let them rest, their work is finish’d,
Nothing now their sleep annoys;
Angels guard th’unbroken slumbers
Of our dear New England boys.
