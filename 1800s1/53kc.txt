To His Friend 
T. Hough
"Kitty Clyde" (4 March 1853)

With a basket to put in her fish,
Every morning with line and a hook,
  This sweet little lass,
  Thro the tall heavy grass,
  Steals along by the clear running brook.

1. O who has not seen Kitty Clyde. 
She lives at the foot of the hill 
In a sly little nook 
By the babbling brook, 
That carries her father’s old mill. 
O who does not love Kitty Clyde, 
That sunny ey’d rssy cheek’d lass 
With a sweet dimp’l’d chin 
That looks rougish as sin, 
With always a smile as you pass, 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Sweet Kitty, Dear Kitty, 
My own sweet Kitty Clyde, 
In a sly little nook by the babling brook, 
Lives my own sweet Kitty Clyde.

2. With a basket to put in her fish,
Every morning with line and a hook.
This sweet little lass,
Through the tall heavy grass,
Steals along by the clear running brook.
She throws her line into the stream,
And trips it along the brook side,
O how I do wish
That I was a fish,
To be caught by sweet Kitty Clyde.

3. How I wish that I was a Bee,
I’d not gather honey from flowers,
But would steal a dear sip
From Kitty’s sweet lip,
And make my own hive in her bowers,
Or, if I was some little bird,
I would not build nests in the air,
But keep close by the side
Of sweet Kitty Clyde,
And sleep in her soft silken hair.
