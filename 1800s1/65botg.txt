1. Bird of the Greenwood why! are thou here?
Leaves dance not o'er there, flow'rs bloom not near,
All the sweet waters far hence are at play,
Bird of the Greenwood Away, Away!
Bird of the Greenwood Away, Away!
tra la la la la la la
tra la la la la
Away, Away!

2. Or art thou seeking some brighter land,
Where by the southwind vine leaves are fann'd
'Midst the wild billows why then delay?
Bird of the Greenwood! Away, Away!
Bird of the Greenwood! Away, Away!
tra la la la la la la la la la
tra la la la la la
Away, Away!

3. Chide not my lingering where storms are dark;
A hand that hath nurs'd me is in the dark;
A hand that has cherish'd thro' winter's long day,
So I turn from the Greenwood, Away, Away!
So I turn from the Greenwood, Away, Away!
tra la la la la la la la la
tra la la la la la la
Away, Away!
