1. Adown by the mur muring stream, 
That merrily winds through the val ley, 
I wandered in days that are gone, 
With the joy of my heart, gentle Allie, 
When dreaming of childhood’s blest scenes, 
One gentle form haunts  me forever, 
’Tis the form of sweet Allie, my queen, 
And she waits by the banks of the river!

CHORUS (ad lib.) [sung after each verse]
Oh! light may the shadows of care 
Pass over the heart of sweet Allie, 
She waits by the riv er for me, 
That merrily winds through the valley.

2. The footsteps of time moving on, 
Will leave me at last in the valley, 
Where oft I’ve been charm’m  by the song 
That flowed from the lips of sweet Allie. 
Oh! would that the bright sunny time 
Of youth might still sparkle forever, 
Like the waters that ceaselessly flow 
In the channels of our belov’d river!
