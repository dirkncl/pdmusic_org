1.
'Twas a beautiful night, the stars shone bright,
And the moon o'er the waters play'd,
When a Cavalier to a bower drew near,
A Lady to serenade
To tend'rest words he swept the chords,
And many a sigh breath'd he!
While o'er and o'er he fondly swore
Sweet maid! I love but thee
Sweet maid! sweet maid! sweet maid!
I love but thee
Sweet maid! sweet maid! sweet maid!
I love but thee.

2.
He rais'd his eye to her lattice high
While he softly breath'd his hopes,
With amazement he sees swinging about with the breeze,
All ready a ladder of ropes!
Up up he has gone, the Bird is flown!
What is this on the ground? quoth he?
"Oh it's plain that she loves, here's some gentleman's gloves,
She's off; and it's not with me!"
For those gloves, those gloves, they never belong'd to me,
For those gloves, those gloves, they never belong'd to me.

Of course you'd have thought
He'd have follow'd and fought,
As that was "a duelling age,"
But this gay Cavalier he quite scorn'd that idea
Of putting himself in a rage.
More wise by far, he put up his Guitar,
And as homeward he went, sung he,
"When a Lady elopes down a ladder of ropes
She may go, to, Hong Kong, for me"
She may go, she may go, she may go,
to Hong Kong for me.
