1. Rouse, hearts of Freedom’s only home! 
Hark to disunion’s cry, 
Dear liberty beheath her dome, 
Proclaim that danger’s lurch; 
Come let your noble shouts ring forth, 
In trumpet voices strong, 

CHORUS 1
“We know no South, we know no North, 
Our Union right or wrong.” 
“We know no South, we know no North. 
Our Union Right or Wrong.” 
“We know no South, we know no North. 
Our Union Right or Wrong.”

2. The temple our brave Father’s made,
The wonder of the world,
Shall they behold their throng dismay’d
When treason’s Flag’s unfurled;
Oh! Never, by the glorious stars
Which on our banner throng;

CHORUS 2 [sung 3 times]
Rouse, sons of three victorious wars,
For Union Right or Wrong.

3. Our patriot Father’s shades,
With Washington on high,
Point to their blood annointed blades
And to their children cry,
Rouse, freeman by your Father’s scars
On to the rescue throng;

CHORUS 4 [sung 3 times]
Defend our flag and sacred stars,
The Union Right or Wrong.

4. Sons of the press proclaim its worth
In telographic fires,
Bid young America stand forth
And emulate their sires;
Wake sister states and hand in hand,
Round Freedom’s Temple throng,

CHORUS 4 [sung 3 times]
Come shout to one united Band,
Our Union Right or Wrong.
