1. Bird of May from far away,
  Come across the stormy sea
Here to chant thy gladsome lay;
  Joyous minstrel, blithe and free,
Seraphlike thy notes are pour’d,
  Making all the welkin ring,
And our hearts, in sweet accord,
  Greet, with thee the flow’ry spring:
[REFRAIN]
Bird of May, Bird of May,
Welcome here from far away.

2. Bird of May, too short thy stay,
  Ere the leaves drop from the tree
In the sereworn Autumn day,
  We shall hear no more of thee.
Even thus must we depart,
  Changelings, for another clime,
There to chant, with thrilling heart,
  Never tiring, songs divine.
[REFRAIN]
Bird of May, Bird of May,
Welcome here from far away.
