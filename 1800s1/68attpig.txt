1. Oh! I’m a girl that’s fond of life, 
My age is twenty one. 
I am averse to noise and strife, 
But very fond of fun; 
And though to vice I’m so inclin’d, 
I like the flattery of mankind, 
And always like to speak my mind, 
Alike to ev’ry one. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
1. For, as
[2. As]
through the Park I go, 
The gents all want to know, 
“Who is that darling girl that drives 
so fast?” they’d like to know.

2. I live at home, with dear mamma, 
and do just as I will, 
While lover’s come from near and far, 
And we with nonsense fill! 
But I tell them all, I’ll be a nun, 
And beg they will at once have done, 
But then they say, I’m only in fun,  
As I laugh behind my fan.
