1. Forth from its scabbard! pure and bright, 
Flash’d the sword of Lee! 
Foe in the front of the deadly fight, 
High o’er the brave, in the cause of right. 
Its strainless sheen like a beacon light, 
Led us to victory.

2. Out of its scabbard! where full long, 
It slumber’d peacefully— 
Rous’d from its rest by the battle song, 
Shielding the feeble, smiteing the strong, 
Guarding the right, avenging the wrong, 
Gleam’d the sword of Lee!

3. Forth from its scabbard! high in air, 
Beneath Virginia’s sky— 
And they who saw it gleaming there, 
And knew who bore it, knelt to swear, 
That where that sword led, they would dare, 
To follow and to die.

4. Out of its scabbard! Never hand 
Wav’d sword from strain as free. 
Nor purer sword led braver hand. 
Nor braver bled for a brighter land, 
Nor brighter land had a cause as grand, 
Nor cause a chief like Lee!

5. Forth from its scabbard! How we pray’d 
That sword might victor be! 
And when our triumph was delay’d. 
And many a heart grew sore afrain. 
We still hoped on, while gleam’d the blade, 
Of noble Robert Lee!

6. Forth from its scabbard! All in vain! 
Flash’d the sword of Lee! 
’Tis shroud ed now in its sheath again. 
Defeated, yet without a stain. 
It sleeps the sleep of our noble slain, 
Proudly and peacefully.
