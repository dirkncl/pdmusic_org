[LURLINE]
[English words]
1.
Oh! Thou to whom this heart ne'er yet
Turn'd in anguish or regret,
The past forgive, the future spare;
Sweet Spirit, hear my pray'r!
Oh! leave me not alone in grief,
Send this blighted heart relief!
Send this blighted heart relief!
Make thou my life my future care,
Sweet Spirit hear my pray'r!
Ah! make my life thy future care,
Sweet Spirit hear my pray'r!
Hear oh! hear my pray'r!
Ah! hear my pray'r.

2.
Oh! Thou to whom my thoughts are known
Calm, oh calm these tremb'ling fears;
Ah! turn away the world's cold frown,
And dry my falling tears!
Oh! leave me not alone in grief
Send this blighted heart relief,
Send this blighted heart relief
make thou my life thy future care
Sweet Spirit hear my prayer,
Ah! make my life thy future care,
Sweet Spirit hear my pray'r!
Hear oh! hear my pray'r!
Ah! hear my prayer.
