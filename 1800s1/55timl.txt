1. Gently dream my darling child,
Sleeping in the lonely wild;
Would thy dreams might never know,
Clouds that darken mine with woe.
Could I smile as thou art smiling,
All my hoipeless hours beguiling,
With the hope that thou might see,
Blessings that are hid from me.

CHORUS 1-4.
[SATB]
[with overlapping voices]
Lullaby my gentle boy,
Sleeping in the wilderness;
Dreaming in thy childish joy,
Of a mother’s fond caress.
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.
[Bass]

2. Sleep, while gleams the council fire
Kindled by thy hunted sire;
Grarded by thy God above,
Sleep and dream of peace and love.
Dream not of the band that perished
From the sacred soil they cherished,
Or the ruthless race that roams
O’er our ancient shrines and homes.

3. Sleep, while night hides home and grave;
Best, while mourn the suffering brave,
Mourning as thou, too, wilt mourn,
Through the future, wild and worn,
Bruised in heart, in spirit shaken,
Scourged by man, by God forsaken,
Wandering on in war and strife,
Living still, yet cursing life.

4. Could thy tender fancy feel
All that manhood will reveal,
Couldst thou dream thy soul would share
All the ills thy fathers bear.
Thiou wouldst weep as I am weeping,
Tearful watches wildly keeping,
By the silverbeaming light
Of the long and lonely night.
