1. Oh, mother, take the wheel away, and put it out of sight, 
For I am heavy hearted, and I cannot spin tonight: 
Come nearer, nearer yet, I have a story for your ear, 
So come and sit beside me, come, and listen, mother dear; 
You heard the village bells, tonight, his wedding bells they were; 
And Mabel is his happy wife, and I am lonely here; 
A year ago tonight, I mind, he sought me for his bride, 
And, who so glad at heart as I, that happy Easter tide?

2. But Mabel came among us, and her face was fair to see,
What wonder was it, mother, that he though no more of me?
When first he said fair words to her, I know she did not hear,
But in the end she listen’d, could she help it, mother dear?
And afterwards we met, and we were friendly all the same:
For ne’er a word I said to them of anger, or of blame,
’Till both believed I did not care, and may be they were right,
But mother, take the wheel away, I cannot spin tonight.
