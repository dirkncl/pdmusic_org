1. A subtle foe has plotted long,
  Few Days, Few Days;
But we will show that we are strong,
  In a few days,
For we are join’d both heart and hand,
  Few Days, Few Days;
We soon shall free our Native land.
  From the dark foe,
Then shout the loud hosanna,
  Few Days, Few Days.
Let mountain and savanah
  The anthem raise.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
While we in emulation,
  Few Days, Few Days;
The guardians of our Nation,
  We’ll keep it free.

2. The demogogue may fret and sue,
  Few Days, Few Days;
And we will show what we can do,
  In a few days.
In Freedom’s sacred cause we band
  Few Days, Few Days;
From Allen rule to free our land.
  From shore to shore,
Then shout the loud hosanna,
  Few Days, Few Days.
Let mountain and savanah
  The anthem raise.

3. To all who comes our land is free,
  Few Days, Few Days;
And learn to prize that liberty
  We love so well;
But claim tis ours, whose fathers died,
  Few Days, Few Days;
Our Native land to guard and guide
  Its fame and laws,
Then shout the loud hosanna,
  Few Days, Few Days.
Let mountain and savanah
  The anthem raise.

4. Tho’ call’d “Know Nothings” we will show,
  Few Days, Few Days;
What we can do as all will know
  In a few days,
For we are joined both heart and hand,
  Few Days, Few Days;
And soon will free our Native land.
  From ev’ry foe,
Then shout the loud hosanno,
  Few Days, Few Days.
Let mountain and savanah
  The anthem raise.
