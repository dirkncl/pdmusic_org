1. Oh! merry ones were singing, making music on the green,
And eyes with love were glancing in the sunshine to be seen;
And left the crowded city, for the pleasure-ground away.
[CHORUS}
  For the pleasureground away, my friends,
  For the pleasureground away,
We left the crowded city,  for the pleasure-ground away.

2. Oh! is it not enchanting, when the woods with music ring,
And bands of burds, commingling, in the trees and bushes sing!
And feet, attuned to action, fly as swift as any deer,
Sweet sounds to chase the moments, and to charm the wakeful ear!
[CHORUS}
  And to charm the wakeful ear, dear friends,
  And to charm the wakeful ear,
Sweet sounds to chase the moments, and to charm the wakeful ear.

3. Oh! summer is a season that is fair, and bright, and gay,
And what’s the use of sighing peace and happiness away?
With spirits light and joyous, till the summer days are o’er,
We’ll hush the sigh of sadness, and rejoice in Nature’s store,
[CHORUS}
  And rejoice in Nature’s store, dear friends,
  And rejoice in Nature’s store,
We’ll hush the sigh of sadness, and rejoice in Nature’s store.
