Silent Nymph, with silv’ry wings 
Hither from thy bow°r stray 
I will show thee choicest things 
Where the wat’ry sunbeams play 

In a nautilus we will glide 
O’er the cool and limpid tide 
From whose surface fathoms through 
Thou my crystal halls shall view 
In a nautilus we will glide 
O’er the cool and limpid tide 
From whose surface fathoms through 
Thou my crystal halls shall view. 
Where through groves of Coral we 
Dance to Naiads’ Minstrelsy 
Dance dance dance 
To the Naiads’ minstrelsy we dance dance 
Dance to the Naiads’ Minstrelsy 
To Naiads’ Minstrelsy. 
Round about our coral throne, 
Melodies of dulcet tone 
They do strike on pearly shells, 
Tun’d by water fairies’ spells, 
Round about our coral throne, 
Melodies of dulcet tone 
They do strike on pearly shells 
Tun’d by water fairies’ spells, 
Si lent Nymph and so will we 
Dance to their sweet Minstrelsy 
Dance dance dance 
To the Naiads’ Minstrelsy 
We dance dance 
Dance to the Naiads’s Minstrelsy 
To Naiads’ Minstrelsy.
