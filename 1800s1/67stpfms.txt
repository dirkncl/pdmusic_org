1. Father, dear, I watch’d and waited, 
Knowing you would come at last, 
Tho’ the tears I could not hinder, 
And my heart was beating fast! 
Now you’re in this Temp’rance Meeting, 
Where your name they’ll gladly take, 
Will you, will you dearest father, 
Sign the Pledge for mother’s sake!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For a moment think, dear father, 
What a joyful home ’twill make, 
Will you, will you dearest father, 
Sign the Pledge for mother’s sake?

2. Will you leave off drinking, father,
It is such a dreadful sin!
And dear mother pines in sorrow,
While her cheek grows pale and thin;
She sits up for you till midnight,
Long, long hours she keeps awake,—
Do now write your name, dear father,
Sign the Pledge for mother’s sake.

3. When the angels took sweet brother,
Up to dwell with them on high,
When the little grave was cover’d,
How she pray’d that we might die!
Then she mourn’d and cried in anguish,
’Till it seem’d her heart would break—
Will you, will you not dear father,
Sign the Pledge for mother’s sake?
