1.
  Slowly where the wind is swelling
Where the sunshine fell at noon,
Rises, o'er the treetops dwelling,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
  Slowly ehere the wind is swelling,
Where the sunshine fell at noon,
Rises, o'er the treetops dwelling,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.

2.
  Now the white thick clouds are drifting,
Coming quickly, passing soon;
Strolling winds thy veil are lifting,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.

3.
  And my light, forever falling,
Is a ne'er forgotten boon:
Of he angels thou art telling,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.

4.
  Thou didst light thy weary yeoman,
Toiling when the day is gone,
Harbinger of golden autumn,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.

5.
  Round and red above the highland,
Silvering o'er its dusky cone,
Came the dreamer's floating island,
  Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon.
