1.
Round my own pretty rose I have hover'd all day
I have seen its sweet leaves one by one fall away,
They are gone, they are gone but I go not with them
No! I linger to star o'er the deolate stem,
They say if I rove to the south I shall meet,
With hundreds of roses more fair and more sweet,
But my heart when I'm tempted to wander replies
Here's my first love my last love my only love lies.

2.
When I sprang from the home where my childhood was nurs'd
'Twas my own pretty Rose that attracted me first,
We have lov'd all the summer and now that the chill,
Of the winter comes o'er us, I'm true to thee still,
When the last leaf is wither'd and falls to the earth
The false one to southerly climes bring forth,
But truth cannot fly from his sorrow he dies,
Where his first love his last love his only love lies.
