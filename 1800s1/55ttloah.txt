1. 
I lie all cold and lonely,
Beneath an elm of night,
And the stars are shining only
And the glowworm twinkles bright,
I sleep where the star gleams quiver,
And my restless mem’ries roam
Away from the golden river
To my boyhoods happy home.

2. 
The golden dream is fleeting,
Away from my troubled sight,
And my heart with hope is beating,
As I see the Cottage light
My father’s Cot before me,
Where in boy gone hours I dwelt,
When the clouds of life came o’er me
When no pain my bosom felt.

3. 
I see my mother smiling,
With a faint uneasy mirth,
And my father’s hands are piling
The fagots on the hearth;
And they whisper ever lonely,
And I think I hear my name
It was breathed in accents holy
And a teardrop with it came.

4. 
The golden sands are gleaming
In the ruddy flush of dawn,
The golden sun is gleaming,
And my nightly dream is gone;
But ever and forever,
In my sleep my wild thoughts roam,
Away from the golden river
To my boyhood’s happy home.
