1. Now calmly they rest from the march and the fray,
They sleep side by side both the “blue and the gray!”
For them let us weep, both for them and our own,
Ah! both have a mother now weeping and lone.
We will weep, we will weep for the gray and the blue!
Let them sleep, let them sleep, gallant souls, brave and true!
As brothers together they’ll rise on that day
When trumpet shall waken the blue and the gray!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We will weep! we will weep for the gray and the blue!
Let them sleep— let them sleep, gallant souls brave and true.
As brothers together they’ll rise on that day
When trumpet shall waken the blue and the gray!

2. Far south is a cottage whence cometh a wail,
For north is a home and a face sad and pale!
Each mourns o’er her brave,, and for both we will pray:
The birds sing the same o’er the blue and the gray.
We will weep, we will weep for the gray and the blue!
Let them sleep, let them sleep, gallant souls, brave and true!
As brothers together they’ll rise on that day
When trumpet shall waken the blue and the gray!

3. We’ll mourn o’er the brave, caring not for the hue,
We’ll weep for the home of the gray and the blue!
But soon thro’ the valleys of Heav’n we will stray,
All clad in white garments for blue and the gray.
We will weep, we will weep for the gray and the blue!
Let them sleep, let them sleep, gallant souls, brave and true!
As brothers together they’ll rise on that day
When trumpet shall waken the blue and the gray!
