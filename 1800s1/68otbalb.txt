1. On the beach at Long Beach, 
One fine Summer’s day 
I’d a novel reading, 
To pass the time away, 
And so interested was I in the plot, 
A gent stood there beside me 
Still I saw him not. 
’Till at last my eyelids 
I did chance  to raise, 
I found him on me looking 
With enraptur’d gaze, 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling 
Handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, 
Quite the pink of beaux.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
On the beach at Long Beach, 
One fine summer’s day, 
I met this handsome man 
Who stole my heart away; 
Now I feel so blissful, 
The happy moments glide. 
The day is quickly coming, 
When I shall be his bride.

2. As like one awaking, 
From some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange, 
His eyes with love did beam; 
And e’er such time was over, 
We began to chat. 
Hours pass’d away, 
Still she beside me sat; 
And with ways so winning, 
He did love impart. 
My spirits rose as high 
As the early mornin lark; 
He told me that he lov’d me, 
Said that all her life, 
Would be to him worthless, 
Unless I’d be his wife.

3. He said if I would marry, 
All troubles we would drown. 
And live in blissful ignorance, 
Of all the cares of town, 
With soft persuasive power, 
He told me of his love, 
Vow ing to be true 
By all the stars above. 
He ask’d me if I’d marry, 
press’d me then to say, 
’Till to his wishes yielding 
I nam’d the happy day! 
He said his cup of bliss 
was filled to the brim. 
He liv’d alone for me, 
And I alone for him.
