1.
Your attention I ask for a while,
To a song I'm going to sing you,
It's about a pretty yaller gal
I met while walking, and she threw such a glance at me:
She was pretty, and as sweet as a flow'r;
Such clothes you never did see---
She's a darling little bonnet, with a flower garden on it,
Had the yaller gal that wink'd at me.

CHORUS
Oh my! she look'd so sweet, and she dress'd so neat,
With her tilting hoops and pretty little feet,
As she went skipping along---
Pretty little yaller gal I met while walking,
And she threw such a glance at me---
As she skipp'd across the gutter, my heart went a flutter,
For the yaller gal that wink'd at me.

2.
I immediately asked her name,
  And she said it was Lucinda;
She said I was a stunner, and for life that I had won her,
  And married we should be---
So I'd dress up and I'd walk by her house
  Every afternoon about three---
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda,
She's the yaller gal that wink'd at me.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh you should have seen her on her wedding day,
  She was handsome as a venus;
When the _parson_ made us one, ah then the thing was done,
  And I never felt so happy in my life,
So I've bought a little place out of town.
  If you go by stop in and see---
You'll be welcom'd by a wife that's as dear to me as life.
She's the yaller gal that wink'd at me.

(CHORUS)
