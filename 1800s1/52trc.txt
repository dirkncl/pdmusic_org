1.
Oh, I'm going far away from my Creditors just now,
I ain't the tin to pay 'em and they're kicking up a row;
I ain't one of those lucky ones that works for "Uncle Sam,"
There's no chance for speculation and the mines ain't worth a ("d--") Copper.
There's my tailor vowing vengeance and he swears he'll give me _Fitts_,
And Sheriff's running after me with pockets full of writs;
And which ever way I turn, I am sure to meet a dun,
|: So I guess the best thing I can do, is just to cut and run. :|

2.
Oh! I wish those 'tarnel critters that wrote homw about the gold
Were in the place the Scriptures say "is never very cold;"
For they told about the heaps of dust and lumps so mighty big,
But they never said a single word how hard they were to dig.
So I went up to the mines and I helped to turn a stream,
And got trusted on the strength of that delusive golden dream;
But when we got to digging we found 'twas all a sham,
|: And we who dam'd the rivers by our creditors were damn'd. :|

3.
Oh! I'm going far away but I don't know where I'll go,
I oughter travel _homeward_ but they'll laugh at me I know;
For I told 'em when I started I was bound to make a pile,
But if they could only see mine now I rather guess they'd smile.
If of these United States I was the President,
No man that owed another should ever pay a cent;
And he who dunn'd another should be banished far away,
|: And _attention_  to the pretty _girls_  is all a man should _pay_. :|
