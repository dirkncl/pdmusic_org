1. Beautiful moon, thou queen of night,
Beaming with thy placid light;
Like the bright stars that nightly shine,
Speakest thou a pow’r divine,
Thou dost borrow light from the sun,
To the course which thou dost run;
Feeling thy kind, and genial rays.
We will sing our cheerful lays.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Beautiful moon, beautiful moon,
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful moon.

2. Smiling bright orb, though sta tion’d high,
Rolling fast in yonder sky;
Roaming abroad, far, far away,
Until lost to light of day.
Kindly guide the traveler home,
Wand’ring far o’er earth alone;
Thou art the lamp whose genial ray,
Shines from heav’n, and marks the way.

3. Beautiful moon, though mild and bright,
Millions hail thy cheering light;
Wonderful truth is told by thee,
Thou art eloquent to me.
Lovely bright orb, undimm’d by time,
Thou  dost shine on ev’ry clime;
Long as the earth or time shall be,
Cheerful songs shall rise to thee.
