1. White man take me back to my home in the West,
  Where my innocent childhood was spent free from care;
Where I’ve play’d with my brothers from morn until night,
  White man take me back, take me there.
Oh! yes take me back to the little wigwam,
  To the home of my fathere and mother so dear;
O’er the warrior’s brow now a shadow is cast,
  In mother’s soft eye is a tear.
    O’er the warrior’s brow now a shadow is cast,
      In mother’s soft eye is a tear.

2. White man take me back to my Indian girl,
  With her dark flashing eye and her long raven hair,
To that tall graceful form which I see in my dreams,
  White man take me back, take me there.
Oh! yes take me back to my Indian girl,
  She is sighing in sadness because I am gone;
No lover is present to comfort her now,
  An Indian girl loves but one.
    No lover is present to comfort her now,
      An Indian girl loves but one.

3. White man take me back where the buffaloes roam
  O’er their own native prairies so boundless and free,
I will join in the chase with the warrior’s brave,
  For that life is the life for me;
Oh! yes take me back to my own native home
  Where an Indian spirit’s as free as the air,
To the prairies and forests we still call our own
  White man take me back, take me there,
    To the prairies and forests we still call our own
      White man take me back, take me there.
