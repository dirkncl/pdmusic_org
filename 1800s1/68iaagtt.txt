1. Of all the Gals dat ever was 
or all I ever see, 
Dere’s only one I ever met 
dat stole my heart from me. 
I met her first one evening 
just as the twilight fell, 
But where we met or what’s her name, 
I aint a going to tell. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
She was sweeter than the sweetest, 
She was neater dan de neatest, 
You may talk about your fashion 
But she really was de Belle; 
But where she lives or what’s her name, 
I aint a going to tell.

2. I called on her next afternoon, 
And hadn’t we a time, 
Her card devisit she gave me 
And den I gave her mine, 
Says I my love when first we met, 
In love with you I fell, 
She answered me but what she said 
I aint a going to tell.

3. Last night I went to see my love 
And ’fore I came away 
I press’d her for to give consent 
And name the wedding day,
She quickly placed her hand in mine 
Den on my buzzom fell, 
We fixed de time but when it is 
I aint a going to tell.

4. We shortly will be married 
And we’ll have a fancy ball 
A genral invitation then 
I’m going to send you all, 
But now I have to see my Gal, 
I’ll bid you all fare well, 
She’s waiting round de corner 
But she told me not to tell.
