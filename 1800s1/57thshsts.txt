1. The heart should have some tuneful strings, 
On which ’twere well to play; 
And music, sweet as seraph sings, 
Shall bless thee on thy way. 
Oh, let it not in slumber lie 
For thousands need its strain, 
To charm away their misery 
And cheer their paths again. 

The heart should have some tuneful strings, 
On which ’twere well to play; 
And music sweet, as seraph sings, 
Shall bless thee on thy way. 
And music, sweet as seraph sings, 
Shall bless thee on thy way.

2. Give out thy soul’s rich melody. 
It will not flow unbless’d, 
If it can dry the mourner’s tear, 
Or somfort the distress’d. 
Then wake the chords that in thee dwell, 
And let the notes go free; 
Then hearts with love and joy shall swell 
In gratefulness to thee.
