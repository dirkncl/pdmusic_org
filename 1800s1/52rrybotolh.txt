1.
Down by the river our log hut stands,
Where Father and Mother once dwelt,
And the old door-latch that was worn by our hands,
And the church in prayer we knelt;
Years, years have past since that happy time,
But the river keeps rolling along.
And the rippling sound on the mossy bank,
Is singing the same old song.

[REFRAIN sung twice after each verse]
Row, row, row your boat,
Gently down the stream
All that's past is gone you know,
The future's but a dream.

CHORUS [sung four times after each REFRAIN]
Row, row, row your boat,
Gently down the stream
All that's past is gone you know,
The future's but a dream.

2.
There stands the tree we used to climb,
And the mill with its rolling din,
And the old wharf boat, there it used to float
Where the school boys used to swim.
High grass grows on the master's grave,
And the river keeps rolling along,
And the birds and the bees, the blossoms, the trees,
Are singing the same old song.
