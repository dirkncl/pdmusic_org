1.
Thy name was once the magic spell
By which my heart was bound,
And burning dreams of light and love
Were wakened by that sound;
My heart beat quick when stranger tongues,
With idle praise or blame,
Awoke its deepest thrill of life
To tremble at thy name.

2.
Long years, long years have passed away,
And alter'd is thy brow,
And we who met so fondly onve,
Must meet as strangers now.
The friends of yore come round me still,
But talk no more of thee,
'Tis idle even to wish it now;
For what art thou to me?

3.
Yet still thy name, thy blessed name,
My lonely bosom fills,
Like an echo that hath lost itself
Among the distant hills;
Which still with melancholy note
Keeps faintly ling'ring on,
When the joyous sound that woke it first,
Is gone, forever gone.
