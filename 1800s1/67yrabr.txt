1.
If yew will lis’n tew my song, I’ve one that may please yew;
I’ve bin a tryin all along tew git up suthin new;
And as the fashion of the times is each one for himself;
I calculate tew make a rhyme, I don’t do anything else.

2.
I ’listed with the three months boys, Way down in old Varmount;
Our capting, he was a real hoss, He’d whip a catamount:
Jist as the roll was all fill’d up, We started off for war;
We did n’t care who we fit with, We warn’t particular.

3.
We landed down in Washington, with knapsacks all well filled;
But our capting tho’t, before we fought, we’d better all be drilled:
So ’twas “eyes right,” “toes out,” “form in line,” and “march out tew by tew;”
But there wan’t a man in the company that any of these things could dew.

4.
Our sargeant finally made a move, which all of us tho’t right,
That every man in the company on his own hook should fight:
So off we started in the night, and jist as day begun,
We jiined U. Sam’s grand army, and arrived safe at Bull Run.

5.
I fit sometime till I got a little tired, and begun to feel sort a dry;
And as I raised my canteen up, I spied “Black Horse” Calvalry:
So I cut dirt and run like a deer (yew couldn’t see my coat tail for the dust),
At “twoforty” pace, ten thousand in the race, tew see who’d get to Washington fust.
