1. I will still preserve my fame,
Whips shall never conquor me,
Tho’ I sink and writhe in pain,
I’m devoted still to thee;
Let the arch seducer come
With his dark and fiendish spell,
One sweet sentene ’scapes my tongue,
Richard, fare thee well.

2. Must I never see thee more,
Lover of this wretched heart?
Hard the fate which we deplore,
Doom’d for ever thus to part;
Snares surround me, but in vain.
Threat will fail my soul to quell,
Yet ere madness racks my brain,
Richard, fare thee well.

3. Soon in other lands we’ll greet,
Where the suff’ring are at rest,
Oh! what happiness to meet
In the mansions of the blest;
Care and sorrow are not known;
There the virtuous ever dwell,—
’Till we reach our heav’nly home,
Richard, fare thee well.
