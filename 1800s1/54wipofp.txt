1. Were I posses’d of fairy pow’r To sail on joyous wing,
  Oh then I would from fairy land The sweetest flow’rets bring.
I’d weave them into coranals, To deck thy maiden brow,
  And make thee lady if I could  More beautiful than now,
    I'd weave them into coronals To deck thy maiden brow,
      And make thee lady if I could More beautiful than now.

2. I’d guard thee with my magic might, from ev’ry scene of ill;
  And it should be a pleasing task, Thy wishes to fulfil,
That like the dread of early years, So might thy life be past,
  And time should o’er thy beauteous brow, His shadows faintly cast.
    That like the dread of early years, So might thy life be past,
    And time should o’er thy beauteous brow, His shadows faintly cast.

3. Thy lips always wear a smile, No tear should dim thine eye,
  And not a cloud should float across, Life’s brilliant summer sky,
Tis thus I’d weld my magic power If e’er such pow’r could be,
  And gladly deem myself repaid, By one sweet smile from thee.
    Tis thus I’d weld my magic power If e’er such pow’r could be,
      And gladly deem myself repaid, By one sweet smile from thee.
