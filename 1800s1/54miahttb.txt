1. The times are so “tight” for the cash is hard to get,
Though all hope they’ll have some tomorrow
And ev’ry one looks “blue” and are in such a pet,
Finding money is a hard thing to borrow.

CHORUSes 1-5
So take down your “shingle” and shut up your shop,
For money is a hard thing to borrow,
So take down your “shingle” and shut up your shop,
For money is a hard thing to borrow.
“Yes indeed.”

2. The banker he looks brave as you ask him for the “chink,”
But he pays our the “ready” with sorrow,
For he cannot stand a “run” and he now begins to think
That money is a hard thing to borrow.

3. The Merchant is cast down with loaded shelves in view,
And no customer buys to his sorrow
For soon from New York he will get a billet doux,
For money is a hard thing to borrow.

4. The politician stares, office costs a mighty “lump,”
And the mouth of his purse is so narrow.
It was just to get some cash, that he got upon the stump,
Knowing money is a hard thing to borrow.

5. The whiskey maker sighs, for the drough has kill’d the corn
And he lood on his prospects with horror,
For he knows his friends won’t stick when he hasn’t got a “horn,”
Finding money is a hard thing to borrow.

6. But honest men ne’er fear, though there come a mighty crash
And a note should fall due on the morrow.
Just call on your friends, they will spare a little cash,
They money is a hard thing to borrow.

CHORUS 6
You can keep up your “shingle” and open up your shop,
Though money is a hard thing to borrow.
You can keep up your “shingle” and open up your shop,
Though money is a hard thing to borrow.
"Yes indeed."
