1.
  Oh! Johnny, lubly Johnny, dear,
What makes you look so queer?
  Have you been calling [mama, now?]
Or drinking lager beer?
  Have you been in de rib'er
To pull de tadpole up
  And found dey broke in two
And had to gib it up?--

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Ah! Johhny, lubly Johnny, dear,
Your equal is not here!
CHORUS
Oh! Johnny, lubly Johnny, dear,
Your equal is not here!

2.
  If Johnny was de Alderman
Ob New York City town,
  He'd shut de Dutchman's groc'ry stores
Or licence must come down;
  He'd stop de cat's from running
On de sunday ob de week,
  And let de ladies and genb'lem
Make railroads ob der feet.--

3.
  He'd take de Broadway pavement
And tear it right straight up,
  To keep de horses on der feet,
For falling is bad luck;
  He'd make de sidewalks wider
To let de ladies walk,
  To keep de genblem's boots and shoes
From tearing all dere __ garments!

4.
  If Johnny goes and marries
Any oder gal dan me,--
  I'll go and feed de lobsters
At de bottom ob de sea;
  Wid de _eels_ I'll _sole_ my boots,
Wid de _catfish's_ _kittens_ play,
  Wid de waves play _pitch_ and _toss_
'Kase Johnny dear's away!
