1. I’ve sung about “the yellow girl,”
And she’s lovely as a Rose,
But now I’ll sing a strain of one,
Indeed you can’t suppose.
Her form is like adonis fair,
Her cheeks blush like the flow’rs,
The only girl that holds my heart,
Is little Fannie Powers.

CHORUS 1&2.
’Twas early in the fall,
I met her at a ball,
She wore a wreath of coral flowers,
As by her side I sat,
My heart went pit a pat,
To look on little Fannie Powers.

2. I asked her then, to dance with me,
If she did feel inclined,
She smiled so sweetly on me then,
And whispered “I don’t mind;”
We danced the Polka o’er and o’er,
And passed the merry hours
I found that night, my heart had flown,
To little Fannie Powers.

3. Then early the next fall
I gave a social ball,
She wore a wreath of orange flowers,
And now I’m blest for life,
For she’s my loving wife,
Is darling litlte Fannie Powers.

CHORUS
3. I could not sleep, I could not work,
For, my heart was wrung with strife,
I went to her, and ask’d her plain,
To be come my darling wife;
She hung her head and blushed so deep,
But her answer you may guess,
She look’d at me then gave a sigh,
And fainttly answered, “Yes!
