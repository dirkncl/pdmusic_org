1. Oh! the old mill wheel it turns, it turns, 
Throughout the live long day. 
And flings  the current of the stream. 
Abroad in glitt’ring spray; 
The old black wheel has turned for years, 
Beside the mossy mill, 
That stands like some old sacred thing, 
Beside the clay red hill.

2. Oh! the old mill wheel it turns, it turns, 
As in my childhood’s hour. 
As when I bathed beneath its spray, 
In its refreshing shower, 
But they who were my comrads  then, 
Are sleeping on the hill, 
And sow to them forever more, 
The old mill wheel stands still.

3. Oh! the old mill wheel it turns, it turns, 
Like times unresting one, 
Which day and night, and night and day, 
Have never ceased to run, 
The old mill wheel’s as emblem true, 
Of time that ne’er stands still, 
I love to see it turning so, 
Beside the mossy mill.

Turning, turning, turning, turning, 
turnning, turning, turning, turning, 
turning, is the old mill wheel. 
Turning, turning, turning, turning, 
turning, turning, turning, turning, 
turning is the old mill
