1. I never left the place that knew me,
And may never know me more;
Where the chords of kindness drew me,
And have gladened me of yore,
But my secret soul has smarted
With a feeling full of gloom
For the days that are departed
And the place I call’d my home
And the place I call’d my home.

2. I am not of those who wander
Unaffectioned here and there,
But my heart must still be fonder
Of my sites of joy  or care;
And I point sad memory’s finger
Thro’ my faithless foot may roam
Where I’ve most been made to linger
In the place I call’d my home
In the place I call’d my home.
