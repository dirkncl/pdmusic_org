"Champagne Charlie" (1867)
Words by H. J. Whymark [George Leybourne?]
Music by Alfred Lee

1.
I've seen a deal of gaiety through out my noisy life
With all my grand accomplishments I ne'er could get a wife,
The thing I most excel in is the P. R. F. G. game.
A noise all night in bed all day, and swimming in Champagne.

CHORUS
For Champagne Charlie is my name, Chamgagne Charlie is my name
Good for any game at night my boys, good for any game at night my boys,
For Champagne Charlie is my name, Chamgagne Charlie is my name
Good for any game at night my boys, who'll come and join me in a spree.

2.
From Coffee and from supper rooms, from Poplar to the Pall Mall,
The girls on seeing me exclaim "Oh! what a Champagne swell!"
The notion 'tis of ev'ry one, if 'twere not for my name,
And causing so much to be drunk, they'd never make Champagne.

CHORUS

3.
The way I gain'd my title's by a hobby which I've got,
Of never letting others pay, however long the shot,
Whoever drinks at my expense are treated all the same;
From Dukes and Lords to Cabmen down, I make them drink Champagne.

(CHORUS)

4.
Some epicures like Burgundy, Hock, Claret, and Moselle,
But Motet's Vintage only satisfies this Champagne swell;
What matter if to bed I go, and head is muddled thick,
A bottle in the morning sets me right then very quick.

(CHORUS)

5.
Perhaps you fancy what I say is nothing else but chaff,
And only done, like other songs, to merely raise a laugh;
To prove that I am not in jest each man a bottle of Cham--
I'll stand tizz round--yes that I will, and stand it--like a lamb.

(CHORUS)
