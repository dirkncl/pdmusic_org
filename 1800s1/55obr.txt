1.
Now white folks I'll sing you a ditty,
I'se from home, but dat's no pity,
Oh, to praise myself, it am a shame,
But Robert Ridley is my name.

CHORUS
Oh, Bob Ridley ho,
Oh, Bob Ridley ho,
Oh, Bob Ridley! Oh!
Oh!! Oh, Robert Ridley ho!

2.
Oh, white folks, I have cross'd de mountains,
How many miles I didn't count 'em.
Oh, I'se left de folks at de old plantation,
And came down here for my education.

(CHORUS)

3.
New York city am a mighty fine one,
For beauty and location it aint behind em.
Oh, de ladies all look so sweet and gidley,
Wonder dey don't fall in love wid old Bob Ridley.

(CHORUS)
