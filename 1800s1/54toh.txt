1.
There's a spot that I love, there's a home that I prize,
Far better than any on earth;
It is bound to my heart by the holiest ties;
And I prize, O, how fondly it's worth!
'Tis not beauty nor splendor endears it to me,
Oh, no! for its grandeur has flown;
But 'tis fondest affection that binds me to thee,
My old home, my dear, happy home!
But 'tis fondest affection that binds me to thee,
My old home, my dear happy, happy home.

CHORUS
O, my old home, my dear old happy home;
It fondest affection that binds me to thee,
My old home, my dear happy home.

2.
O, home, what dear magic is in that sound;
How closely it speaks to my heart;
What a world of deep tenderness in thee is found;
O, who from such treasures could part?
Could barter the joys for a sweet home of love,
For a path in a strange world unknown;
Could seek for vain pleasure and heartlessly rove,
If they knew the true value of home?
Could seek for vain pleasure and heartlessly rove,
If they knew the true value of home?

3.
Some sigh to be wealthy, some seek to be great,
Some envy what others can do;
But O, I'm content in my lowly estate,
For the hearts all around me are true;
And ties that are nearest and dearest to me,
And hearts that are truly mine own,
With fondest affection now bind me to thee,
My old home, my dear, happy home!
But 'tis fondest affection now bind me to thee,
My old home, my dear happy, happy home.

(CHORUS)
