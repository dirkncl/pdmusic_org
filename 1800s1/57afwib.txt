1.
  I'm a wild and laughing girl,
  Just turned of sweet sixteen,
As full of mischief and fun
  As ever you have seen;
And when I am a woman grown,
  No city beau for me.
If ever I marry in this life,
  A farmer's wife I'll be.

[CHORUS after each Verse]
  A farmer's wife I'll be,
  A farmer's wife I'll be,
If ever I marry in this life,
  A farmer's wife I'll be!

2.
  I love the smiling orchards
  Where the golden apple grows;
I love to pluck the flowers,
  The daisy and the rose;
And fields of grass and waving corn
  Are sights I love to see,
If ever I marry in this life
  A farmer's wife I'll be!

3.
  Let those who like it best
  Enjoy the smoky town,
Midst dusty walls and and dusky walks
  To ramble up and down;
But sunny fields and shady groves
  Have charms enough for me.
So if ever I marry in this life
  A farmer's wife I'll be!
