1. On the ribber Talapoosa,
  Near old Coosauda town;
There liv’d a lovely yellow girl,
  Her name was Olive Brown.
Her hair was of de darkest.
  Her cheek was soft as down;
And her form was far de finest
  Of all de gals around.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Oh lovely Olive Brown!
  Oh lovely Olive Brown.
The sweetest girl that ever liv’d
  In Coosauda town.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Oh lovely Olive Brown!
Oh lovely Olive Brown,
The sweetest girl that ever liv’d
In Coosauda town.

2. I courted once dis yellow girl,
  Of beauty ne’er surpass’d;
Her head was deck’d with many a curl,
  Her teeth of pearl were cast;
She tripp’d along with fairy grace,
  Her eyes like diamonds shone,
And she was known thro’ our the place,
  As “Lovely Olive Brown.”

3. Tho’ the darkies all were singing
  Of their sweetheart, “Lubly Mai,”
And of other gals dat’s stealing
  All de Darkies hearts away:
Yet to me there’s none so charming,
  As the lovely Olive Brown
Who liv’d in Talapoosa
  Near old Coosauda town.

4. Don’t talk to me of “Lucy Neal,”
  Or little “Nelly Bly”;
There charms are nothing to compare
  With sweet Olive’s, ’fore she die.
She sang so sweetly all the day,
  And ne’er was known to frown;
Oh she carried every heart away,
Did lovely Olive Brown.

5. But now how changed, my heart is sore,
  All lonely here I roam;
I never shall see sweet “Olive” more,
  Save in our heavenly home;
Yes, down among the willows
  Far ’neath the mossy ground,
Where nightengales are singing,
  Sleeps, the lovely Olive Brown.
