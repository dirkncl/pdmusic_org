I love this land, its sunny clime, its golden sand, 
its birds, their chime, its [lurfy?] vales, 
its flow’ry hills, its woodland dales, its crystal rills, 
its crystal rills. 

I love this land, its sunny clime, its golden sand, 
its birds, their chime, its [lurfy?] vales, 
its flowry hills, its woodland dales, 
its crystal rills, its crystal rills. 

But! more than that I love the man, 
the man with valor clad, with valor clad who left his clan 
of bliss & glee, of bliss & glee, of bliss & glee. 

I love the man with valor clad, who left his clan, 
to make this land of golden sand renown’d & free, 
to make this land renown’d & fee, 
to make this land renown’d & free, 
to make this land, this land renown’d & free.
