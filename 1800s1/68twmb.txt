1. Raise high the white man’s banner, 
Let it float upon the air; 
Fling to the breeze the honor’d names 
Of Seymour and of Blair, 
Of Seymour who the Statesman is, 
Of Blair, the hero bold; 
And let the laurel wreath surround 
These blazoned words of gold.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then comrades join the column; 
March onward to the fight 
Beneath the whiteman’s banner— 
The laurel and the white. 
[SOLO]
Three cheers for Seymour and Blair; 
[CHORUS]
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah. 
[SOLO]
Three more cheers for Seymour and Blair, 
CHORUS]
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah.

2. With names like these to conquer with, 
A people may be strong 
In vindicating every right 
In crushing out each wrong. 
Let, then, all freeborn patriots, 
Join with a brave intent 
To vindicate our Father’s choice, 
“A white man’s Government.”

3. No mendicant or negro rule 
For men who truly prize 
A heritage of glory from 
The great, the true, the wise. 
Let Grant and Colfax fight beneath 
The flag of sable hue;
A nobler banner we will raise
And nobler deeds we’ll do.
