1. O, long I have sung of sweet Kitty Clyde 
Who lived at the foot of the hill; 
And tho’ that sweet pretty bird has flown, 
Another is living there still. 
She’s lithe and gay as the robin that sings, 
On the trees by the old millside; 
And if ever I loved a girl in my life, 
’Tis the charming sweet Minnie Clyde. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
O, Minnie Clyde, she is my pride, 
And sore I am no jester; 
For if ever I loved a girl in my life, 
’Tis Minnie, Kitty Clyde’s Sister.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
O, Minnie Clyde, she is my pride, 
And sure I am no jester; 
For if ever I loved a girl in my life 
’Tis Minnie, Kitty Clyde’s sister.

2. I think her eyes are brighter than Kitty’s, 
The dimple  in her chin is deeper, 
I would be imprison’d the rest of my life, 
With Minnie Clyde for my keeper; 
In the festive throng she sings a sweet song, 
With the lowly alike she is meek; 
Her eyes are the windows of her soul, 
Thro’ which Minnie’s heart would speak.

3. O, blest are the hearts that live in the cot,
That stands at the foot of the hill;
O, sweet are the songs that echo in the glen,
By the murmur of the meekcovered mill;
The birds all chant their notes to Minnie,
The angels above have caress’d her
But you have the angels and you have the birds,
And I’ll have Kitty Clyde’s sister.
