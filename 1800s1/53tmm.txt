1.
Where slowly winds a sylvan dream,
  From th' gloomy shade,
  Of a dark wild glade,
A woman's form, in the' moon's pale beam,
Knelt by an infant's grave.
Her hair swept o'er a brow of white,
Her eye shone with unearthly light,
And her moaning voice, the live long night,
Was heard across the waves:
  Ha! ha!
  La! la!
The winds are sighing,
Night birds flying
Art then lonely
With me only?
Rest, my baby, rest!
Ah! rest!

2.
Her heart was broke, her mind was gone,
  She shed no tear,
  She said no pray'r.
But ever by that little one,
She'd sing her lullaby.
The chill night dew is on her brow;
What recks she of its coldness now,
If by that grave she still can bow
And sing so moaningly!
  Ha! ha!
  La! la!
The' waves pass slowly singing lowly!
Do they cheer thee,
Murm'ring near thee
Rest, my baby! rest!
Ah! rest!

3.
Who dug the grave? Ah! none could tell!
  Nor what her name
  Who nightly came,
While her unbound hair so wildly fell,
And, spirit like, knelt there!
Long grass waves o'er that little head,
And flowers planted there are dead!
But still sweeps by that wailing sad
Upon the midnight air.
  Ha! ha!
  La! la!
O'er the sleeping
Lone watch keeping!
None else to love thee
Save One above thee
Rest, my baby! rest!
Ah! Rest!
