1. Oh, great is thy mission, thou angel of freedom.
Not far from thee now is the goal to be won,
The Gospels will tell us, if rightly we read them
How a sentinel stood unharm’d in the sun.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
The orb of thy frame to its zenith uprisen,
Thy firm spirit yet stands unhurt in the flame,
And vain are the capture, the shackles, the prison;
For freed men look upward still shouting thy name.

2. The dark war cloud that pour’d its ruin all ’round us
Hath roll’d its red flood from the hills to the sea,
And the pitiless storm that nearly hath drown’d us
Reserv’d all its lightnings proud  eagle for thee.

3. Oh, haste thee away then thy comrades await thee
Whom oppression and grief so lately have slain,
Our hosts o’er the Jordan with gladness will greet thee
There is thy sole refuge from sorrow and pain.
