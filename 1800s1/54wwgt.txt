1. We were girls together,
And ever side by side,
While o’er the blooming heather,
To school we daily hied.
To us the rose ne’er had a thorn,—
The dewdrops all were pearls;
Life seem’d but one gay summer morn,
When you and I were girls.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
We were girls together,
And ever side by side,
While o’er the blooming heather
To school we daily hied.

2. We were girls together,
And bright the future seem’d;
When in our happy cottage home,
We ne’er of care had dream’d.
Your soul was like the cloudless sky,
When morn her wing unfurls,
And hope flash’d proudly from your eye
When you and I were girls.

3. We’ve grown old together,
And with life’s ebbing tide,
We’ve seen the lov’d for ever
Beyond our vision glide.
We feel the promis’d port is near,
For Faith and Hope unfurls
Their starry sheen— to us so dear,
When you and I were girls.
