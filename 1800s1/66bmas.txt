1. O carry me back where I fell,
There beneath the grassy sod;
Lay this wounded form to rest,
“While my soul returns to God,”
Place above the Soldier’s head,
A lowly board like those that tell
O’er many a southern grave,
The spot where our brave Heroes fell.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Bury me at sunset hour,
Where the last bright ling’ring ray,
In the crimson eastern sky
Marks the closing of the day.

2. Who will tell my mother dear,
How I bravely fighting, fell
’Mid the whistling of the shot,
And the screaming, bursting shell;
We were comrades when we lay
In old Libby’s prison cell,
Don’t refuse my last request,
Bury me comrades where I fell.

3. Soon the cruel war will end,
And o’er ev’ry land and sea
Floats our Unions’s starry flag,
Emblem of a people free.
Don’t forget me when I’m gone,
I have loved my country well,
I shall gladly for her die,
Lay me comrades where I fell.
