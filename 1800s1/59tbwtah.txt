"The Boy with the Auburn Hair" (1859)
As Sung by E. F. Dixey

1.
It was on a summers morn-n-i-ing all in the month of may,
And in those flowery gard-en-i-ing where Bessie she did stay,
I overheard a dam-u-siel in sorrow to complain,
All for the sake of her lov-ier he ploughed the roaring main.

SOLO and CHORUS
With his Oh, oh,
oh oh oh oh oh, ho,
he was her darling boy,
He was the boy with the auburn hair
his name was Mcavoy.

2.
I stept up to this dam-u-iel and did her much surprise,
Because she did not know me I being in singular disquise.
Says I my charming creature my gay young hearts delight,
How far have you to trav-u-el this dark and stormy night.

(SOLO and CHORUS)

3.
The way kind sir to Mamsi-yunk If you will please to show,
And pity a poor distracted maid for there I have to go,
In search of the faithless heartless young man and Snicklefritz is his name
All on the banks of the Schul-li-kill I'm told he does remain.

(SOLO and CHORUS)

4.
If Johnny Kizer he was here he'd keep me from all harm,
But he's on the field of bat-tu-el with his gallant uniform,
He's on the field of bat-tu-iel his foes he will destroy
Like a roaring boy from Dar-bi-a he fought in Germantown.

(SOLO and CHORUS)
