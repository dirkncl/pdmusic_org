1. The early flower had shed its leaf,
Its loveliness so pure and brief
Our tho’ts has filled, our hearts control,
As mem’ry stirs the stricken soul.
We see thee now, fair noble boy,
Whose beauty death could scarce destroy,
With sparkling eye and rosy cheek,—
A boon which guardian angels seek.

2. That sleep of thine may close thine eyes,
But Willie, thou wilt early rise;
Yes there thy morning sun now shines,
And gilds thy home in fairer climes.
’Tis no lone land, but happy throngs
There fill sweet Heav’n with raptrous songs,
Which, borne to earth, could we but hear,
How blest would Willie’s home appear.

3. He lives to greet and welcome there
The hearts he loved and still would share;
And we can almost hear his notes
As round us his glad spirit floats;
And hov’ring o’er our path by day,
The little seraph seems to say,
"In Jesus’ arms I’ll wait for you;
Here, here our loves we’ll long renew."
