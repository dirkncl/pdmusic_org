1. When the morning’s glory breaketh,
  Gilding all the wide spread sea,
And the bugle’s note awaketh,
  Ringing out so loud and free;
When the evening twilight falleth
  Slowly o’er our bark again,
And the bell the night watch calleth,
  Home beloved, I miss thee then!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Mary a year I’ve wander’d far,
And gazed on foreign vale and glen;
But while midst all their charms so winning,
Home beloved— I miss thee then!
Home beloved— I miss thee then!

2. When the heavy thunder pealeth
  Shaking earth with fearful jar,
And the lightnings flash revealeth
  Every tall and tapering spar—
When the stars in midnight splendor
  Seem to fill the hearts of men
Only with thoughts holy, tender—
  Home beloved— I miss thee then!

3. When we’ve safely braved the dangers
  Of the storm and of the seas,
And within the ports of strangers
  Our good frigate lies at ease;
When I hear the heavy tramping
  Of the despot’s steelarmed men,
Every warm heart’s ardor damping—
  Home beloved— I miss thee then!
