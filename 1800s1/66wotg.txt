1.
Oh! Johnny dear, and did you hear, the news that's lately spread,
That nevermore the Southern cross must rear its stately head;
The "White and Red's" forbid by law, so Northmen proudly say,
Nor you, nor I, can e'er again be "Wearin' of the Grey!"
And when we meet with strangers, who take us by the hand,
Enquiring warmly of the South, our own beloved land.
We've bound to tell the woful truth, let cost whate're it may,
That some are threaten'd e'en with death, for "Wearin' of the Grey!"

CHORUS
We've bound to tell the woful truth, let cost whate're it may,
That some are threaten'd e'en with death, for "Wearin' of the Grey!"

2.
Then since the color we must wear is of the hateful blue,
The children of the Sunny South must be to mem'ry true;
Ah! take the cockade from their hats and tread it 'neath the feet,
And still tho' bruis'd and mangled [most?], 'twill speak a language sweet;
And huried in our heart of hearts the precious words lie hid,
Where oft they can't the bitter tears to wet the drooping lid.
But let them flow they do us good thro' all the mournful day,
While constant we do call to mind the "Wearin' of the Grey!"

CHORUS
But let them flow they do us good thro' all the mournful day,
While constant we do call to mind the "Wearin' of the Grey!"

3.
And if at last our father's law be torn from Southland's heart,
Her sons will take their household go[o]ds and for away depart;
Rememb'ring still the whisper'd word, to weary wand'rers giv'n,
That justice pure, and perfect rest, are found alone in heav'n,
Then on some green and distant isle beneath the setting sun,
We'll patient wait the coming time when life and earth are done,
Nor even in the dying hour while passing calm away,
Can we forget or e'er regret the "Wearin' of the Grey!"

CHORUS
Nor even in the dying hour while passing calm away,
Can we forget or e'er regret the "Wearin' of the Grey!"
