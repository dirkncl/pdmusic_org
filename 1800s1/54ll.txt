1.
We have parted in sadness
With pale Lilly Lee;
But her slim eye in gladness
A bright hand shall see:
She has gone to inherit
A home with her God,
In the land of the spirit,
No mortal hath trod.

CHORUS 1
We have parted in sadness,
With pale Lilly Lee,
But her dim eye in gladness,
A bright hand shall see;
She has gone to inherit,
A homw with her God,
In the land of the spirit,
No mortal hath trod.

2.
She has gone there before us,
But we’re not alone,
For she’ll kindly watch o’er us
’Till life’s work is done;
Then with angels she’ll meet us,
And bid us to some,
And with anthems they’ll greet us,
And welcome us home.

CHORUS 2
She has gone there before us,
But we’re not alone,
For she’ll kindly watch o’er us,
Till life’s work is done;
Then with angels she’ll meet us,
And bid us to come,
And with anthems they’ll greet us,
And welcome us home.

3.
Yes, we’ll all meet in gladness,
On that distant shore,
Where the fever and madness,
Of life will be o’er;
Where the forms that are faded,
In beauty shall bloom,
Where no hearts e’er are shaded,
In sorrow and gloom.

CHORUS 3
Yes, we’ll all meet in gladness,
On that distant shore,
Where the fever and madness,
Of life will be o’er;
Where the forms that are faded,
In beauty shall bloom,
Where no hearts e’er are shaded,
In sorrow and gloom.
