1.
Sad news from home for me,
Friends gather there in gloom,
Friends who have join'd in glee,
Oft, in that cottage home;
But oh! how chang'd that home is now,
No longer joyful hearts are there,
Withing the tomb that aged brow,
That aged Father's free from care.

[REFRAIN]
Sad news from home,
Friends gather there in gloom,
Friends who have join'd in glee,
Oft, in that Cottage home.

2.
Lonely a Mother weeps,
Breaking her heart in vain,
Mourning for him who sleeps,
Ne'er to awake again;
And oh! her lov'd ones by her side,
So sadly gazing thro' each tear,
Without a Father for their guide,
Can ne'er again feel happy here.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Far, far away I roam,
Far from my native land,
Oft, will I sigh for home,
Sigh for each kindred hand;
Tho' I man ne'er again behold,
The home and friends so dear to me,
There is a Heaven we are told,
Where all that's good on Earth shall be.

(REFRAIN)
