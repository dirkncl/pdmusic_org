O Joyful, joyful Spring!
How welcome to they coming;
The flow'rs and trees put forth their leaves,
And busy bees are humming.
Joyful Spring! How welcome is thy coming.
The flow'rs and trees put forth their leaves,
And busy bees are humming.
The trees put forth their leaves,
And busy bees are humming.
And all day long,
The happy song,
Of birds upon the wing,
Of birds upon the wing,
In accents sweet
Appear to greet,
Thy coming gentle Spring.
In accents sweet,
Appear to greet,
Thy coming gentle Spring,
Thy coming gentle Spring.

O Joyful, joyful Spring!
Forgot is winter now--
Thy flow'ry hand hath swept away
The snow-wreath from his brow!
Joyful Spring! Forgot is winter now;
Thy flow'ry hand hath swept away
The snow-wreath from his brow.
Thy hand hath swept away
The snow-wreath from his brow.
Thy warmth is felt.
The ice drops melt
To dew tears from above!
To dew tears from above!
The streamlets flow,
They bless and flow,
Like gen'rous human love.
The streamlets flow,
They bless and flow,
Like gen'rous human love.
Like gen'rous human love.

O Joyful, joyful Spring!
The glad heart looks around!
And feels the throb of ardent life
In all its pulses bound
Joyful Spring, the glad heart hooks around,
And feels the throb of ardent life
In all its pulses bound,
The throb of ardent life,
In all its pulses bound.
Then heart to heart,
Sweet thoughts impart,
For Love reigns sov'reign king!
For Love reigns sov'reign king!
In very truth, Life seems all youth,
In the Joyful time of Spring!
In very truth, Life seems all youth,
In the Joyful time of Spring!
The Joyful time of Spring,
The time of Spring!
