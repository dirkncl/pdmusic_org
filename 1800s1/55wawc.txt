1.
When I came to town lately
  I found-- 'tis no joke,
Men, Women and Children,
  Were all wearing cloaks;
So I says to myself,
  Do as other folks do,
And to be in the fashion,
  We'll wear a cloak too,

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
For we all wear cloaks,
  We all wear cloaks,
To be in the Fashion,
  We all wear cloaks.

2.
Why not? for I'll prove 
  In the course of life's pther,
We, all of us wear a cloak
  Some time or other;
For there's none but must own,
  However great is their pride,
There are somethings,
  'Tis sometimes convenient to hide.

3.
The dany is military
  Still wears his cloak,
And thinks a cigar
  Is the tiffy to smoke;
With his fine frill and wristbeads
  He makes a great show;
But take off his cloak,
  'Tis all dickey, you know.

4.
Young Miss with her beauty--
  Her airs and her graces,
In he hood of her cloak
  Often carries two faces;
Her lover declares
  She's an angel uncommon,
Till she throws off her cloak,
  When he finds she's a woman.

5.
The Lover, till wed,
  Seems to court beauty's way,
And says he but lives
  Her commands to obey;
But once tightly roused
  In the conjugal yoke,
_Do as I tell you, madam!_
  For off goes his cloak.

6.
The Lawyer a cloak wears
  As well as the lover,
So many odd suits
  He has always to cover;
His cloak once thrown off,
  Shows a great deal of evil;
For instead of the Lawyer,
  Oh, this the-- (Devil.)

7.
The Doctor will boast
  Of his skill, and the way
To lengthen out life
  And cheat death of his prey;
He has a grand panacea
  For every ill,
And when he's no Lancet,
  He'll bleed with a Bill.

8.
Some Clergymen there are,
  Of the hypocrite stock,
Who care more for the fleece
  Than they do for the flock;
You may always know such
  Before you instal--
For the larger the salary,
  The louder the call.

9.
The Singer will sing you
  A song for your pelf,
With his eye on your purse,
  And his thoughts, on himself;
The ring of the spelter,
  Is his key note-- I choke,
So, I pray you excuse me,
  And I'll keep on my cloak.
