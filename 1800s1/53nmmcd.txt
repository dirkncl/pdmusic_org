1. The southern sun was sinking low,
And bathing all in beauty’s glow;
The blooming vale lay calm and still,
And silence reign’d on ev’ry hill;
Then as I gaz’d with loving eyes,
I heard this tender strain arise.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
“Never more, Clara dear,
Never more my Clary dear,
Never more, Clara dear,
Shall my songs at evening greet your ear.”

2. The sun now sank far from my sight,
And hill and vale wrapt in night,
But soon the moon in lovliness,
Came forth again the scene to bless;
Still I gaxed with loving eyes,
I heard the strain once more arise.

3. And thus we ever fondly rave,
Whose love extends beyond the grave;
And where the little black girls sleep,
The faithful lovers come to weep;
And nightly there they breathe their sighs,
And nightly there these strains arise.
