1. Down where the waving willows
’Neath the sunbeams smile,
Shadow’d o’er the murm’ring waters
Dwelt sweet Annie Lisle;
Pure as the forest lily,
Never tho’t of guile
Had its home within the bosom
Of sweet Annie Lisle.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Wave willows, murmur waters,
Golden sunbeams, smile!
Earthly music cannot waken
Lovely Annie Lisle.

2. Sweet came the hallow’d chiming
Of the Sabbath bell,
Borne on the morning breezes
Down the woody dell.
On a bed of pain and anguish
:Lay dear Annie Lisle,
Chang’d were the lovely features,
Gone the happy smile.

original publication of 1858, the were added in 1860]

3. Toll bells of Sab-bath morn-ing,
I shall never more
Hear your sweet and holy music,
On this earthly shore.
Forms clad in heav'nly beauty,
Look on me and smile;
Waiting for the longing spirit
Of your Annie Lisle.

4. Raise me in your arms, dear mother,
Let me once more look
On the green and waving willows,
And the flowing brook;
Hark! those strains of angel music,
From the choirs above:
Dearest mother, I am going,
Truly, "God is love."
