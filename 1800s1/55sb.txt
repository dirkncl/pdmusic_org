1. Say, brothers, will you meet us,
Say, brothers, will you meet us,
Say, brothers, will you meet us
  On Canaan’s happy shore! 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
Glory, glory, hallelujah,
For ever, evermore!

2. By the grace of God we’ll meet you,
By the grace of God we’ll meet you,
By the grace of God we’ll meet you,
  Where parting is no more. 

3. Jesus lives and reigns for ever,
Jesus lives and reigns for ever,
Jesus lives and reigns for ever,
  On Canaan’s happy shore.
