1. Down by the river our log hut stands,
Where father and mother once dwelt;
And the old door latch that was worn by our hands,
And the church where in prayer we knelt.
Years, years have pass’d since that happy time,
And the river is rolling along;
And the rippling sound on the mossy bank,
Is singing the same old song.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream,
All that’s past is gone, you know, the future’s but a dream.
Row, row, gently down the stream,
Row, row, row, gently down the stream.

2. There stands the tree that we used to climb,
And the mill with its rolling din;
And the old wharf boat, there it used to float,
Where the school boys used to swim.
Still the old hut is standing there,
And the river is rolling along;
And the birds and the bees, the blossoms, the trees,
Are singing the same old song.
