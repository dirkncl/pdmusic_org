1.
Softwly now the light of day
Fades upon our sight away;
Free from care and labor free,
Lord, we would commune with Thee.

2.
Thou, whose all pervading eye
Naught excapes, without, within,
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

3.
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee. Amen.

1.
Holy Spirit, Light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase th shades of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.

2.
Holy Spirit, Pow'r divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin, without control,
Held dominion o'er my soul.

3.
Holy Spirit, Joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

4.
Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down ev'ry idol throne;
Reign supreme, and reign alone. Amen.

Words by Samuel Longfellow, 1819-1892

1.
Holy Spirit, Truth divine,
Dawn upon this soul of mine;
Word of God, and inward Light,
Wake my spirit, clear migh sight.

2.
Holy Spirit, Love divine,
Glow within this heart of mine;
Kindle every high desire;
Perish self in thy pure fire.

3.
Holy Spirit, Power divine,
Fill and nerve this will of mine;
By Thee may I strongly live,
Bravely bear, and nobly strive.

4.
Holy Spirit, Right divine,
King within my conscious reign;
Be my Lord, and I shall be
Firmly bound, forever free. Amen.
