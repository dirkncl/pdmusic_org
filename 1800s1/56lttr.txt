1. When spring with gayest verdure glowing 
Decks meadow wood and vale 
And the balmy breezes flowing, 
With sweets perfume the gale:
When nature’s plum’d and mellow choirs, 
Chant forth their minstrelsy 
Of all the songs the soul inspires 
The Robin’s notes for me.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Listen, listen, listen, 
listen, listen, listen, 
listen to the Robin 
as he sings on yonder tree.

2. When angry winter wild and dreary 
Soars round with icy wing, 
And our hearts, with grief and sorrow weary, 
Sigh for reviving spring: 
’Tis the Robin’s thrilling notes proclaim, 
The dawn of the blooming year 
Heart and soul with rapture gleaming 
When his glad song we hear.
