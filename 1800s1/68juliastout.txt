1. My massa told me last week,
  that he’d give me this day out,
So I’ve dress’d myself up in my best,
  To see my Julia Stout.
The promise that she gave to me,
  And that all in good time.
She said that she’d meet me in the lane
  When the clock scruck hald past nine.
My Julia she is handsome as every body knows;
  She’s sweet as the flowers,
that in the garden grows.

I’ll chuck myself up to the moon,
Not kno’ing what I’m about.
For the real extract of a sugar plant,
Is excentric Julia Stout.

2. The first time I Julia met,
  ’Twas at a fancy hop,
There was meershaums belles and dandy swells,
  But she was at the top.
Acquaintance there I sought with her,
  And ever since that time,
It made me feel quite jubilant,
  To think that she’d be mine.
And when that we got married,
  And as we live in clover
I’ll invite all the darkies to the feast
  When it is over.

I’ll chuck myself up to the moon
  Not knowing what I’m about,
For the real extract of a sugar plant,
  Is excentric Julia Stout.

3. So now good friends, I must away.
  I bid you now good night.
Yet ’ere I go I’ll let you know
  I’m glad you’re here tonight.
I’ll set Julia up in business,
  In a great big peanut stand.
Two doors above the Jacob’s sons,
  In the Bowery street near Brand.
And if in business she would fail, 
  Alas I’ll have to go,
Disgrace myself and join the
  “Freedmans Burioe”

The members may not like it,
  But I’ll have them be content,
For I’m a trueborn American
  Citizen of African descent.
