1. God of the Free! upon Thy breath 
Our Flag is for the right unroll’d,
Still broad and brave as when its stars 
First crown’d the hallowed time of old
For honor still their folds shall fly,
For duty still their glories burn.
Where Truth, Religion, Freedom guard,
The patriot’s sword and martyr’s urn.

CHORUS 1
Then shout beside thine Oak, O North!
O South! wave answer with thy palm,
And in our Union’s heritage,
Together lift the Nation’s Psalm.

2. How glorious is our mission here,
Heirs of a virgin world are we,
The charter’d lords whose lightnings tame
The rocky mound and roaring sea,
We march and nature’s giants own
The fetters of our mighty cars:
We look and lo! a continent
Is couch’d beneath the Stripes and Stars.

CHORUS 2
Then shout beside thine Oak O North!
O South! wave answer with thy palm,
And in our Union’s heritage,
Together lift the Nation’s Psalm.

3. No tyrant’s impious step is ours,
No lust of pow’r on nations roll’d,
Our Flag for friend a starry sky,
For foes a tempest eve’ry fold.
Oh! thus we’ll keep our nation’s life,
Nor fear the bolt by despots hurl’d,
The blood of all the world is here,
And they who strike us, strike the world.

CHORUS 3
Then shout beside thine Oak, O North!
O South! wave answer with thy palm,
And in our Union’s heritage,
Together lift the Nation’s Psalm.

4. God of the Free! our nation bless,
In its strong manhood as its birth;
And make its life a star of hope
For all the struggling of the earth:
Thou gav’st the glorious past to us,
Oh! let the present burn as bright,
And o’er the mighty future cast

CHORUS 4
Truth’s shout beside thine Oak, O North!
O South! wave answer with thy palm,
And in our Union’s heritage
Together lift the Nation’s Psalm.
