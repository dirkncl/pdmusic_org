1. America beloved, revered
  We would an anthem chant to thee,
With loyal hearts that beat the time
  To Freedom’s thrilling minstrelsy.
UNITED STATES thy name of strength,
  By solemn DECLARATION given,
That bears the signatures of Saints
  To truths triumphant, born in Heav’n.
That bears the Signatures of Saints
  To  truths triumphant born in Heav’n!

2. No crown is thine, for Liberty
  Bestowed on thee here diadem;
And WASHINGTON, thy FATHER, gave
  A lustre to its ev’ry gem.
Thy Banner gleams with glorious light
  From brilliant Stars which symbolize
A Galaxy of Sov’reign States
  The Stars of Hope in Freedom’s Skies.
A Galaxy of Sov’reighn States
  The Stars of Hope in Freedom’s Skies.

3. Beneath those stars on heaven’s blue,
  In emblem lines of red an white,
The precious blood and purpose pure
  Of Sires are kept in mem’ry bright:
And, like those Sires of SEVENTY SIX,
  Thy sons who stand that flag beneath,
Shall let no breath of treason taint
  The air thy loyal millions breathe;
Shall let no breath of treason taint
  The air thy loyal millions breathe.

4. But Freedom’s hymn shall cleave the sky,
  In grand Niag’ra’s thunder tone,
From rugged Maine’s rock bounded coast
  To California’s golden zone:
Till, echoes by responsive notes,
  Uprising from the land and sea,
That Hymn sublime throughout the world
  Shall sound the March of Liberty.
That Hymn sublime throughout the world
  Shall sound the March of Liberty.

5. Then loved Republic, blessed in all
  That Science, Art and Labor bring,
Fair Peace in Plenty’s lap shall rest
  Beneath thine Eagle’s shelt’ring wing:
And strong in right, thy hero hosts
  Shall humbly bow with hearts that own
No power but Heaven’s omnicient King,
  No throne but HIS eternal throne!
No power but Heaven’s omnicient King,
  No throne but HIS eternal throne!
