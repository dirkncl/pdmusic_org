"Far away, far away native land,
The chime so dear wherever we may be,
  We can never know till we press a foreign strand,
How pine our hearts for thee."

====
1. From my native land tho’ I wander far away,
My heart can ne’er forget
Its familiar scenes follow me where ’ere I stray,
With mem’ry’s teardrops wet.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Far away, far awy native land,
The chime so dear where ever we may be,
We can never know ’till we press a foreign strand,
How pine our hearts for thee.

2. Other lands may boast of a milder, brighter sky,
Where winter blasts ne’er come,—
Of a chime where perfumes are ever floating by,
But oh, ’tis not my home!

3. Tho’ the rude, bleak winds wander round my native cot,
And stormclouds sweep the sky,—
With my kindred dear, mine shall be a happy lot,
There let me live and die.
