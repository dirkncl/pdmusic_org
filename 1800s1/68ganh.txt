1. O shout from he hillside, the valley and the plain!
A ray of hope is beaming upon our land again;
For side byu side with Colfax, the statesman tried and true,
A Nation's honor'd hero will lead her hosts anew.

CHORUS 1-6.
Then shout from the hillside, the valley and the plain,
A nation's honor'd Hero will lead her host again.

2. We'll rally all our forces 'round the banner of the free,
And joining the Grand Army, march on to victory;
With Grant and Colfax leading, we'll never fear defeat,
Our foes must surrender, or beat a long retreat.

3. With confidence we're looking to him whose faithfulness
And courage brought our nation out of the Wilderness;
On from the Chicago Platform we'll enter for the race,
And those who dare oppose us must soon give up the chase.

4. All hopes of White House glory the turncoat must resign
For "if it takes all summer" we'll fight in on this line,
And from his post dishonor'd we shortly will send home
That obstinate old compound of Veto pow'r and rum.

5. With Justice for our motto, breath'd forth on ev'ry gale,
And Grant and Colfax leading, we surely must prevail,
Well may all traitors tremble, for in their last estate,
Surrender uncondition'd will surely be their fate.

6. Let three times three be given for glory's honor'd son,
Who ever fought for freedom and ev'ry battle won;
Then shout from the hillside, the valley and the plain!
A nation's honor'd Hero will lead her hosts again.
