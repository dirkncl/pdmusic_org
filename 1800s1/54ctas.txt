1 .Oh! wont you come, my Rosy dear,
  And take a sail with me
My boat is laying just out here,
  And only wafts for thee.
She is the nicest little boat,
  Upon the Tennessee;
She痴 got the sweetest name afloat,
  I names her after thee.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then take a sail with me my dear,
  And down the stream we値l glide.
You値l never feel the slightest fear,
  While I am by your side.

2. The weather now is fine and clear,
  There痴 not a cloud above,
So take you seat my Rosy dear,
  And then right off we値l shove.
I値l 稚end the sail and you shall steer,
  And when we move along,
We値l raise our voices both so clear
  In some nice little song.

3. We値l seek some green and shady spot,
  And there we値l go ashore;
We値l build a pretty little cot:
  And stay there evermore.
Then wont you come my Rosy dear,
  And take a sail with me;
My boat is laying right out here:
  And only waits for thee.
