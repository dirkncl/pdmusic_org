My happy Days were then.

1. A Mother’s name is dear to all,
The first we lisp in infant day;
And when our golden youth hath flown,
We love to sing it in our lays:
’Tis sweet to mem’ry to recall,
The watchful care, and cheering smiles,
Of a dear Mother’s loving heart,
A heart that ne’er its love beguiles.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
There’s many names we all revere,
And cherish’d ones to us most dear,
But none more sweet to us are giv’n,
Than those of Mother, Home and Heav’n.

2. The name of home we love to hear,
Tho’ it may ring from us and tears;
There is in it a charm that binds,
Our hearts to scenes of bygone years:
We ne’er from mem’ry can efface,
The hallow’d spot that gives us birth,
The glowing hearts of youthful friends,
Who join’d us in our sports of mirth.

3. The name of Heav’n doth wing our thoughts,
From joys of earth that quickly die,
To never fading ones that bide,
Within the realms of yon fair sky:
We love to dwell upon the thought,
That we with those we lov’d so well,
Shall meet again where all is joy,
In that bright land where Angels dwell.
