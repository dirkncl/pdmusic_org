1.
Huzza for the prairies wide and free;
Ho! for the Kansas plains;
Where men shall live in liberty,
Free from a tyrant's chains.
We will ask no page in story,
Prouder than the spotless glory,
Of a land that gives her might
To the battle of the right.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Huzza for the prairies wide and free;
Ho! for the Kansas plains;
Where men shall live in liberty,
Free from a tyrant's chains.

2.
We sprun at the power, and break the rod,
Wreaking in guilt and crime;
We bow the knee to none but God,
Maker, and King of time;
And the brave will round us rally,
From the mountain and the valley,
Till the skies with freedom ring,
And the world shall hear us sing.

3.
O sweet is the charm of rock and tree;
Bright are the flowing rills,
Where we have roam'd to youthful glee,
Over the eastern hills;
But we turn from all their beauty,
To the call of truth and duty,
And we give our chainless might,
To the battle of the right.

4.
Tho' far from the soil of Pilgrim fame,
On the Atlantic shore,
Here we build a noble name,
Proud as our fathers were.
And the far off Rocky mountains,
With their flashing lakes and fountains,
Shall behold our glory spring,
While the world shall hear us sing.
