1.
Do they miss me at home
Do they miss me at home?
'Twould be an assurance most dear
To know that this moment some loved one
Were saying I wish he were here
To feel that the group at the fireside
Were thinking of me as I roam
Oh yes 'twould be joy beyond measure
To know that they missed me at home
To know that they missed me at home.

2.
When twilight approached the season
  That ever is sacred to song
Does some one repeat my name over
  And sigh that I tarry so long
And is there a chord in the music
  That's missed when my voice is away
And a chord in each heart that awaketh
  Regret at my wearisome stay,
  Regret at my wearisome stay.

3.
Do they set me a chair near the table
  When evening's home pleasures are nigh,
When the candles are lit in the parlor,
  And the stars in the calm azure sky?
And when the "good nights" are repeated
  And all lay them down to their sleep,
Do they think of the absent, and waft me
  A whispered "good night" while they weep?
  A whispered "good night" while they weep?

4.
Do they miss me at home -- do they miss me
  At morning, at noon or at night?
And lingers one gloomy shade round them
  That only my presence can light?
Are joys less invitingly welcome,
  And pleasures less hale than before,
Because one is missed from the circle
  Because I am with them no more?
  Because I am with them no more?
