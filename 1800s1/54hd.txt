1.
  Home delights! Home delights!
  Jewels in memory's own;
The sweet little valley beside the old cottage,
  Made sunshine to brighten my home.
  True, life's changes cross our path;
  True, dear friends have passed away;
  But those happy scenes of youth,
Cheer each heart, and bless each day.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
  Home delights! Home delights!
  Jewels in memory's own;
The sweet little valley beside the old cottage,
  Made sunshine to brighten my home.

2.
  Fireside scenes! Fireside scenes!
  Caskets of happy spent years;
Though seasons trouble this gleam of sweet solace
  To youthful remembrance endears.
  Hearts best warmly with true love,
  Hearts then from deceit were free;
  The good old fireside scenes of youth
  Never can forgotten be.

3.
  Early days! Early days!
  Treasures of love-lasting worth;
The old homestead cottage and sweet little valley
  Were dearer than all else on earth.
  Parents lie beneath the sod;
  Brothers and sisters most dear;
  But those early days of youth
  Soothe life's toil, and calm each fear.
