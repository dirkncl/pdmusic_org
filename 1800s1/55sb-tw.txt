1. Bachelor's Hall! what a square looking place it is
Kape me from sich all the days of my life;
Sure but I think what a burnin’ disgrace it is,
Never at all to be gettin’ a wife;
See the old bachelor, gloomy and sad enough,
Placeing his tay kittle over the fire,
He soon tips it over Saint Patrick! he’s mad enough,
(If he were present) to fight with the Squire.

2. How like a hog in a mortar bed wallowing,
Awkward enough, see him knading his dough;
Troth! if the bread he could ate without swallowing,
How he would favor his palate you know.
Pots, dishes, pans and such greasy commodities,
Ashes and prata skins kiver the flour;
His cupboard’s a storehouse of comical oddities,
Things that had never been neighbours before.

3. His meal being over, his table’s left sitting so,
Dishes take care of yourself if you can;
But hunger returns, then he’s fuming and fretting so,
Och! let him alone for a taste of a man;
Late in the night when he goes to bed shiverin’,
Niver a bit is the bed made at all;
He crapes like a tarapin, under the kiverin’,
Bad luck to the picture of Bachelor's Hall.
