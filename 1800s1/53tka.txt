1. I lib in de hut by de side ob de brook, 
I dar plow and plant de tater, 
Dar cum sich a storm dat it swoop dem all away, 
I ’scape on de back ob allegater, 
He go down de riber ahead ob de storm, 
His tail make de water froth and spatter;
He fly like  de bullgine but neber off de track, 
Dat de snapin tercle ax him what de matter.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On dis side ob sun down and tudder side de moon, 
Dis daekie on de back ob Allegater, 
He go see de great show dis side de state ob Maine, 
He feed him all de way on sweet pertater.
On dis side ob sun down and tudder side de moon, 
Dis daekie on de back ob Allegater, 
He go see de great show dis side de state ob Maine, 
He feed him all de way on sweet pertater.

2. De next day at noon jus a fore de moon was up,
We pass out de Missisippe riber,
And when out de great guff ob Mexico we got,
He snorted like de horse dat had de feber,
Den all along de guff streum we plow de big ditch,
Not a hill ob corn nor tater patch was no whar,
De water in de big ditch, he raise so mighty high, 
Dat I spoke to de darkness in de moon dar.

3. I ax him whar he gwin to, I ax him o’er again,
He say whar de sun rise down east,
To de great Cristle Palice in de city ob New York,
Whar de darkies had dar own way at de great feast;
We den see’d de light house on ole Sandy hook,
We pass twix dat and Cuney Ilin
And den thro’ de narrers  we leff Tellegraf behine
Twas a smokin hot day and we wer swetin.

4. I go along box but a darkie make it roun,
In de box I put my rousin allegater,
I took him to de resevoy for dat was de place,
So I fill him to de brim wid croten water,
De gemin at de door, he ob course let me in,
Sich a gemin jus like me from ole Kentucke,
I didn’t pay a fip but I talk to gemin dar,
And I kiss de gals as day cum flockin roun me.

5. Oh, den I go examin eb’ry ting in de great show,
And I write down all dar names in my portfoleyo,
As soon as I got back to ole Kentuck again,
Den I’ll build one on de banks ob de Ohio,
I’ll make it from de top to de bottom all wid glass,
It shall reach from Lueyville to Cennenatte,
From udder side ob sun down and dis side ob de moon,
Dey will call me one eye Ceasor from Kentucke.
