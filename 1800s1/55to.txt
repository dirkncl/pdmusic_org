1. The Seampstree by her candle sits, 
The pleasant day is past.
And down her cheeks, by sorrow pal’d 
The burning tears flow fast;
She thinks upon the lov’d, who lean 
For life upon her hand, 
For, fatherless, her lot is cast 
Amid an orphan band Poor mother died,  
And father’s dead, 
And brother, sister, cry for bread.

2. How patient all the night she plies 
Her fingers to the task, 
For when the morrow morning comes, 
For bread the Orphans ask: 
And she is father, mother, now, 
Although her eyes are dim 
With weeping, And her heart is full, 
with sorrow to the brim.

3. Oh gentle spirit, God will bless 
Her patient work of love;
A glory crown for such as her, 
He keeps in Heav’n above: 
And though her cheek may paler grow, 
And toiling she may die, 
For watching o’er the fatherless, 
She has a home on high, 
For watching o’er the fatherless, 
She has a home on high.
