1.
Good evening white folks, lend your ears,
And to my song just listen,
I'm here tonight to tell my little story,
And what I have to lucidate
Will make your eyeballs glisten,
So gaze upon Adolphus Morning glory.

2.
There is a charming colored gal,
A blushing sylph of sweetness,
That's thrown a magic spell of love before me,
She's young and lovely as a rose,
A bunch of maiden neatess,
Just suited to Adolphus Morning glory.

3.
Next week I'm going to married be
To charming Marianna,
And them my name will live in fame and story,
For I'm go'ng to run for congress
Way down in Alabama,
That's where you'll find Adolphus Morning glory.
