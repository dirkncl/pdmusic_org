1. Hark! ’tis Freedom’s battlecry,
  Pealing over hill and glen,
Thrilling upward to the sky;
  Hear it! ye who would be men.
Ye who love the true and right,
   Honest rule, and equal laws,
Gather, gather in your might,
  Strike again for freedom’s cause.

2. Like the voice of meeting floods
  Rushing downward to the sea,
Like the roar of windtoss’d woods,
  Sounds the toesin of the Free!
Rock, and tree, and mountain crest,
  Echo to the glad refrain,
From the prairies of the West,
  To the farthest coast of Maine.

3. Up— ye haters of the wrong!
  Freedom calls you to the fray,
Up— and to her standard throng,
  There is work for you today!
Hand to hand with tryant Power
  Ye must battle as ye can—
Courage! ’tis the promised hour!
  And it brings “The Coming Man.”

4. Sound his name from State to State,
  Louder than the ocean’s roar—
From Pacific’s “Golden Gate”
  To the far Atlantic’s shore.
LINCOLN! hark, from all our coasts,
  Millions join the glad acclaim!
LINCOLN leader of our hosts—
  Victory is in his name!
