1. Oh! please don’t laugh when I relate 
To you a story sweet. 
It’s all about a  charming girl 
That I by chance did meet. 
’Twas love at first sight when we met, 
Those lips so red and cherry. 
Oh! what a stunning girl it was, 
That I met on the Ferry. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Walking thro’ the Cabin, 
Passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, 
Hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me 
For I can’t be merry, 
Since I met that little dear, 
Crossing on the Ferry.

2. I scarcely knew, which way to look, 
For she a midget seem’d. 
Electric sparks I thought I felt, 
So bright her eyes they beem’d, 
For ev’ry glance was like a lance, 
As in my heart they’d bury. 
Until I felt, I scarce knew how, 
While crossing on the Ferry.

3. Our journey’s end at last arrived, 
My heart beat slow and fast. 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them past, 
She turn’d her head and spoke to me, 
In a voice so soft and merry, 
Saying, write a note to Station D. 
Sign, crossing on the Ferry.
