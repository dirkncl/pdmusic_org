1.
Old fogies may brag of their crusted Port,
Their drops of short and all that sort,
And bottles or rare old stuff may sport,
But sparkling wines for me,
Cliquot and Moselle and rare old hock,
Of a fizzing kind I keep in stock,
For there’s life in that, as soon as you knock
The neck off the bottle d’ye see my boys.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
And like music, the corks with a pop! pop! pop!
pop! pop! pop! and pop! pop! pop!
Like music the corks with a pop! pop! pop!
fly away from the sparkling wine.
And then round the corner we pop! pop! pop!
pop! pop! pop! and pop! pop! pop!
And then round the corner we pop! pop! pop!
and all thro’ the sparkling wine.

2.
It raises the spirits I know my boys,
It causes noise, and all the joys,
With which a fast swell his time employs,
When out on a jolly spree,
The knockers we wrench ere the break of day,
The dare devil tricks we often play,
And the chase, when from police we’re running away,
And all due to the sparkling wine my boys.

3.
And last scene of all when you’re settled and done
It keeps up the fun, in debt you can tun,
And you don’t care a fig for a both’ring dun,
When primed with the sparkling wine.
And when all your money and credit are gone,
If you keep to the wine, you’ll not feel forlorn,
And your clothes, and your jewels, you’re welcome to pawn,
To buy a new stock of the wine my boys.
