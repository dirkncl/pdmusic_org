1. Standing where the bleak winds whistled 
Round her small and fragile form; 
Arms withing torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
’Cept to jostle her aside— 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She in tones of anguish cried 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
“Mister! Please give me a penney, 
For I’ve not got any Pa— 
Please, Sir, Give me just one penny— 
I want to buy some bread for Ma!”

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
While we beg for those with plenty, 
And for them to us unknown, 
We’ll not forget our little “barefoots,” 
They are heathens nearer home.

2. Hailing thus each passing stranger, 
As they hurriedly went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
Others cast a frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry: 
“I must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die. 

3. There, dis chilly day in winter, 
BAREFOOT sat upon the pave. 
Outstretch’d were her little fingers, 
But no pennies did she crave— 
There, while begging bread for Mother, 
Death had chill’d her little heart. 
Yet each day we see some other 
Playing LITTLE BAREFOOT’S art.
