1. “A song for our banner,” the watch word recall, 
Which gave the Republic her station: 
“United we stand, divided we fall;” 
It made and preserves us a nation! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
The union of lakes, the union of lands, 
The union of States none can sever 
The union of hearts—  the union of hands— 
And the flag of our Union for ever, ever, ever, 
And the flag of our Union for ever. 
The flag of  our union for ever and ever! 
The union of hearts the union of hands 
And the flag of the union forever! 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
The flag of the union for ever And ever! 
The flag of the union for ever And ever 
The union of hearts— the union of hands— 
The flag of the Union forever.

2. What God in his infinite Wisdom designed, 
And armed with his weapons of thunder, 
Not all the earth’s despots and factions combined, 
Have the power to conquer or sunder!
