1. There’s a banner that gratefully swells in the breeze, 
’Tis a vision of glory to see, 
Shining out like a star on the waste of the seas 
As it floats o’er the hearts of the free, 
There’s the white for the pure and the blue for the true, 
Like the promise of God that we see, 
And we’ve culled from the gardens of Heaven’s deep blue, 
The stars for our bright Fleur de lis. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then Hurrah for the Flag of the Free, 
Hurrah for the Flag of the Free, 
For a herald of right and an emblem of might, 
Is the star spangled Flag of the Free.

2. It makes tyrants tremble forever.
It waves, O’erlands where love fetters are worn,
Where tyryants are worshipped by groveling slaves,
And free serfs are yet to be born,
At Liberty’s birth this, flag was unfurled,
Britannia grew pale at the sight,
For she knew it must one day give laws to the world
And become a young giant in might. 

3. E Pluribus Unum ’twas the watchword of night,
Which fired our fathers of yore,
More terrible far in the blaze of the fight, 
Than the shock of the Cannons wild roar,
E Pluribus Unum oh long may it stand,
A tower of strength in our cause,
And may we forever with one heart and hand
Stand up for our Flag and our Laws.
