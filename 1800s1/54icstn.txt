1. I cannot sing that song to night,
For in its words and music dwell.
While all your hearts seen gay and light
To me a sad and fearful spell
For tis the song I used to sing,
For him when all was hope and truth
Before I know that time would fling
One shadow o’er my happy youth,
  Before I know that time would fling
  One shadow o’er my happy youth.

2. I would repress the rising tear
Then ask me not to sing that song.
It tells, how hard it is to part
From those to whom, we fondly cling.
Its notes find echo in my heart
That song I cannot dar not sing
Its notes find echo in my heart
That song I cannot, dare not sing.
  Its notes find echo in my heart
  That song I cannot, dare not sing.
