"Goober Peas" (1866)
Words by A. Pindar, Esq.
Music by P. Nutt, Esq.

1.
Sitting by the roadside on a summer day,
Chatting with my messmates passing time away,
Lying in the shadow underneath the trees,
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!

CHORUS
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas! eating goober peas!
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!

2.
When a horseman passes, the soldiers have a rule,
To cry out at their loudest "Mister here's your mule,"
But another pleasure enchantinger than these,
Is wearing out your Grinders, eating goober peas!

(CHORUS)

3.
Just before the battle the General hears a row,
He says "the Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now,"
He turns around in wonder, and what do you think he sees
The Georgia Militia, eating goober peas!

(CHORUS)

4.
I think my song has lasted almost long enough,
The subject's interesting, but rhymes are mighty rough,
I wish this war was over when free from rags and fleas,
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts and gobble goober peas!

(CHORUS)
