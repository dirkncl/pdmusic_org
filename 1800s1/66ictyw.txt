1. I wander’d through the forest green,
I heard the song birds sing,
While fkiwers gay their perfume sweet,
Around my path did fling.
I sat me down in thoughtful mood;
I heav’d ah! yes, a sigh
You’ll ask perchance, what made me sad,
I cannot tell you why.

CHORUS 1-3.
I sat me down to thoughtful mood;
I heav’d ah! yes, a sigh
You’ll ask perchance what made me sad,
I cannot tell you why.

2. Then looking up, I quickly saw
Towards me advancing near
A something handsome brave, and gay
A gallant cavalier.
He smil’d on me, like woodland fay,
I should have turn’d to fly—
Don’t ask me, please, what made me stay,
I cannot tell you why.

3. The words he spoke, so fair and fond
Right welcome were to me.
He said, Oh! leave thy forest home
My loving Wife to be
I saw that truth shone on his brow
And as no onw was by,
I answer’d “Yes,” nay ask me not,
I cannot tell you why.
