1. I feel I’m growing old, Lizzie!
My noon of life is past,
The bloom has left my cheek, Lizzie!
My hair is whitening fast:
But my heart beats quick and warm, Lizzie!
As when we both were young,
And words of truest love, Lizzie!
Are ever on my tongue,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I feel I’m growing old, Lizzie!
My noon of life is past,
The bloom has left my cheek, Lizzie!
My hair is whitening fast:

2. What tho’ the brow be scarred, Lizzie!
And bent by age the form,
What tho’ the eye, be dim, Lizzie!
The heart may yet be warm,
True love! fades not with youth, Lizzie!
But deepens to life’s even,
’Tis here an op’ning bad, Lizzie!
And only blooms in Heaven!

3. Our Life is on the wane, Lizzie!
And briefer grow the hours,
Though thorns be in our way, Lizzie!
We’ll only pluck the flowers,
We’ll Love! as young hearts Love, Lizzie!
And bravely meet each storm,
And die! as we have lived, Lizzie!
With hearts as true as warm!
