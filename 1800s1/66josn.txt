"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas" (circa 1866)
Words and Music
by Benjamin Russell Hanby, 1833-1867

1. Jolly old Saint Nicholas,
Lean your ear this way!
Don’t you tell a single soul
What I’m going to say:
[CHORUS]
“Christmas Eve is coming soon;
Now you dear old man
Whisper what you’ll bring to me;
Tell me if you can.”

2. When the clock is striking twelve,
When I’m fast asleep
Down the chimney, broad and black,
With your pack you’ll creep.
[CHORUS]
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row.
Mine will be the shortest one.
You’ll be sure to know.

3. Bobby wants a pair of skates.
Suzy wants a sled.
Nellie wants a picture book,
Yellow, blue, and red.
[CHORUS]
Now I think I’ll leave you
What to give the rest.
Choose for me, dear Santa Claus;
You will know the best.
