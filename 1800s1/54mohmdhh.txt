1. There’s a spot that I love, there’s a home that I prize
  Far better than any on earth,
It is bound to my heart by the holiest ties,
  And I prize oh how fondly its worth;
’Tis no beauty nor splendor endears it to me,
  Ah no for its grandeur hath flown,
But ’tis fondest affection that binds me to thee,
  My Old House, my dear happy Home.

2. O home! what dear magic is in that sweet sound,
  How closely it speaks to the heart,
What a word of deep tenderness in thee is found,
  Oh who from such treasure could part;
Could barter the joys of a sweet home of love,
  For a path in the wide world unknown,
Could seek for vain pleasures and heartlessly rove,
  If they knew the true value of home.

3. Some sigh to be wealthy, some seek to be great,
  Some envy what others can do,
But oh I’m in my lowly estate,
  For the hearts all around me are true.
And ties that are nearer and dearer to me,
  And hearts that are truly mine own,
With fondest affection now binds me to thee,
  My Old House, my dear happy Home.
