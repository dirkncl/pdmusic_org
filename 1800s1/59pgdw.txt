1.
When de night walks in, as black as a sheep,
And de hen and her eggs am fast asleep,
Den into her nest with a sarpent's creep,
  "Pop goes de Weasel."
Oh all de dance dat eber was plann'd
To galvanize de heel and de hand,
Dar's none dat moves so gay and grand
  As "Pop goes de Weasel."
De lover, when he pants t'rough fear,
To pop de question to his dear,
He joins dis dance, den in her ear,
  "Pop goes de Weasel!"

2.
John Bull tells, in de ole cow's hum,
How Uncle Sam used _Uncle Tom_,
Whil he makes some white folks _slaves_ at home,
  By "Pop goes de Weasel!"
He talks about a friendly trip
To Cuba in a steam warship,
But Uncle Sam may make him skip
  By "Pop goes de Weasel!"
He's sending forth his iron hounds
To bark us off de fishin' ground--
He'd best bewarr of Freedom's sounds
  Oh "Pop goes de Weasel!"

3.
De Temperance folks from Souf to Main,
Against all liquor spout and strain,
But when dey feels an ugly pain
  Den "Pop goes de Weasel!"
All New York in rush now whirls
Whar de _World's Fair_ am when our girls
  Dance "Pop goes de Weasel!"
Den form two lines as staight as a string,
Dance in and out, den three in a ring--
Dive under like de duck, and sing
  "Pop goes de Weasel!"
