1. Beautiful bells, oh, beautiful bells,
Thy gentle music I joyously hear!
How to my heart thy witchery tells
Tales of the past ever dear.

[CHORUS 1-2.]
Wilt thou rerurn once more unto me,
On wings of sweet echo to banish my pain?
Hark! hark! the strain! it comes o’er the lea
In ravishing sweetness again.
Beautiful bells, oh, beautiful bells,
Bringing back pleasures so dear to the heart;
Love’s deathless flowers still beauty will braid,
Wreathing round memory’s urn.
Beautiful bells, oh, beautiful bells.

2. Joys of my youth, they never will fade,
But back again will on bright wings return;
Love’s deathless flowers beauty will braid,
Wreathing round memory’s urn.
