1.
The other night while I was sparking Sweet Torlina Spray,
  The more we whispered our love talking,
The more we had to say;
  The old folks and the little folks,
We thought were fast in bed,--
  We heard a footstep on the stairs,
And what d'ye think she said?
O! kiss me quick and go my honey,
  Kiss me quick and go!
To cheat surprise and prying eyes,
  Why kiss me quick and go!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Kiss me quick and go my honey,
  Kiss me quick and go;
To cheat surprise and prying eyes,
  Why kiss me quick and go!

2.
Soon after that I gave my love
  A moonlight promenade,
At last we fetched up to the door,
  Just where the old folks stayed;
The clock struck twelve, her heart struck two (too)
  And peeping over head
We saw a night cap raise the blind,
  And what d'ye think she said?
O! kiss me quick and go my honey,
  Kiss me quick and go!
To cheat surprise and prying eyes,
  Why kiss me quick and go!

3.
One Sunday night we sat together,
  Sighing side by side,
Just like two wilted leaves of cabbage
  In the sunshine fried;
My heart with love was nigh to split
  To ask her for to wed,
Said I; Shall I go for the priest,
  And what d'ye think she said;
O! kiss me quick and go my honey,
  Kiss me quick and go!
To cheat surprise and prying eyes,
  Why kiss me quick and go!
