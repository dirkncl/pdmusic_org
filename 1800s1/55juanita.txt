1. Soft o’er the fountain,
Ling’ring falls the Southern moon:
Far o’er the mountain,
Beaks the day— too soon!
In thy dark eyes’ splendor
Where the warm light loves to dwell,
Weary looks— yet tender
Speak their fond farewell!

Nita! Juanita!
Ask thy soul if we should part?
Nita! Juanita!
Lean thou on my heart.

2. When in thy dreaming;
Moons like these shall shine again
And daylight beaming
Prove thy dreams are vain:—
With thou not relenting—
For thine absent lover sigh
In thy heart consenting
To a pray’r gone by?

Nita! Juanita!
Let me linger by thy side!
Nita! Juanita!
Be my own fair bride!
