1. This darkey used to long, 
When he lived in the lowlands, 
Many, ah! many years ago, 
To leave the old plantation 
And the fields of cotton, 
And to leave the lowlands low.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Down in the lowlands, 
In the southern valley, 
Down in the lowlands low. 
There let me live 
Till old age is over, 
Make my grave in the lowlands low.

2. Now down in the lowland. 
In the Southern valley 
Times have changed evermore 
No more they sound  the horn 
To make the darkies rally, 
To tote away the cotton and the corn.

3. I travelled thro the North, 
They no care for darkey, 
So back to the low lands I go 
To breathe the warm sunshine 
In the Southern valley, 
And to live in the lowlands low.

4. But sad is the change, 
This darkey is no welcome, 
Ole Massa is dead long ago 
The little old hut 
I used for a shelter, 
Is no more in the lowlands low.
