1. How happy in the days of youth 
Roll’d every hour away, 
When our hearts were light and faces bright, 
And all the world was gay; 
When ev’ry chord within each breast, 
To love and joy was strung; 
Oh! all was hope and happiness, 
In the days when we were young. 
  Oh! all was hope and happiness 
  In the days when we were young.

2. And sweet the flowers that deck’d our path,
All nature’s face look’d fair;
Where’er abroad the world we trod
What lovely things were there.
While o’er each view her gorgeous hue,
Fair fancy ever flung,
Oh! all was bright and beautiful,
In the days when we were young.
  Oh! all was bright and beautiful,
  In the days when we were young.

3. Then friendship, sweeter far than all,
We thought could ne’er decay;
Nor friends beloved, who faithful proved
Would ever pass away.
Their voice was music to our ears,
Upon their smiles we hung,
Oh! all the loves and tenderness
Of the days when we were young.
  Oh! all the loves and tenderness
  Of the days when we were young.
