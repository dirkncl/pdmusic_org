1.
Oh take me back to Tenessee,
  To my dear home once more;
Where the river runs so merrily,
  Down by the cabin door.
And when I see those fields again,
  How happy I shall be,
To hear the darkies welcome song,
  Dear land of Tenessee!

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Oh! I can never here remain,
  There is no joy for me;
This land I値l leave, and back again,
  I値l go to Tenessee.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Oh! I can never here remain,
  There is no joy for me;
This land I値l leave, and back again,
  I値l go to Tenessee.


2.
Poor Nelly, she will cry with joy,
  And call me by my name!
She loved me when a little boy,
  And loves me still the same.
The birds will sing their merry songs,
  I think I hear them still:
The robin and the jay are there,
  And the lonely whippoorwill.

3.
There is no joyous music now,
  To glad my list地ing ear;
The banjo痴 happy tone is mute,
  No dear old songs I hear.
Oh! I will never here remain,
  No pleasure now I see.
Farewell! I must go back again
  To dear old Tenessee.
