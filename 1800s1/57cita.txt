1. The bonnie, bonnie bairn, who sits poking in the ase,
Glowering in the fire wi’ his wee round face;
Laughing at the futtin lowe, what sees he there?
Ha! the young dreamer’s bigging castles in the air.
His wee chubby face, and his touzie curly pow,
Are laughing and nodding to the dancing lowe;
He’ll brown his rosy cheeks, and singe his sunny hair,
Glowering at the imps wi’ their castles in the air. 

2. He sees muckle castles towering to the moon!
He sees little sodgers pu’ing them a’ doun!
Worlds whombling up and down, bleezing wi’ a flare,
See how he loups! as they glimmer in the air.
For a’ sae sage he looks, what can the laddie ken?
He’s thinking upon naething, like mony mighty men;
A wee thing makes us think, a sma’ thing mak’s us stare.
There are mair folk than him bigging castles in the air. 

3. Sic a night in winter may weel mak’ him cauld:
His chin upon his buffy hand will soon mak’ him auld;
His brow is brent sae braid, O pray that daddy Care,
Would let the wean alane wi’ his castles in the air!
He’ll glower at the fire! and he’ll keek at the light!
But mony sparkling stars are swallow’d up by night;
Aulder een than his are glamoured by a glare,
Hearts are broken, heads are turn’d wi’ castles in the air.
