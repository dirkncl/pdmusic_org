1. White folks attention a song 
I’ll sing to you, ’bout matters and things 
that we are engaging. 
I will tell you in these times 
In a few and simple rhymes. 
Caze I’m rite from de happy land of Cannan.   

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, oh, oh, ae, ae, ae, ab, 
De day ob de penticost am coming, 
So nebber mind de neddes, 
But get ober double trouble, 
Caze I’m rite from de happy land of Canaan.

2. At Harper’s ferry section,
They had an insurrection,
Ole Brown thought de niggers would sustain him,
But ole Govenor Wise,
Put de spectacles on his eyes,
And sent him to de happy land of Cannan.

3. The Ladies now a days
Promenade Broadway
The Star of the Hoops am a gaining
If they stop to have a talk
They cover up the whole sidewalk
But there’s no Hoops in the Happy land of Cannan.

4. De Zouave Cadets
They won all the bets
And beat all the Soldiers a training
They stand on their Heads
And never slept in Reds
And dey charged for the Happy land of Cannan.

5. There was some Japanese
Come here to raise a breeze
And brot little Tommy to entertain em
But he fell in love
With a pretty little dove
And took her over to the Happy land of Cannan.
