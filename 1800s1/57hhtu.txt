1. ’Tis the will of all the North,
  And from it we’ll not flinch;
No more soil for slvvery,
  Not another inch!
We ask not Southern men to yield
  A single right they hold,
Or to give up a single slave
  That they can sell for gold.

CHORUS 1-4.
Hurrah! hurrah! the Union,
We swear that it shall stand,
Preserv’d by Freemen it shall be,
A great and glorious land!

2. But sternly this:— We do demand
  That,— that compromise shall be
Respected! which once truly made
  Our northwest frontier free;
That Kansas,— and Nebraska
  Shall by freemen’s feet be trod,
And the Democratic party learn,
  That there is in Heaven a God.

3. In sunny Greece a *temple rose
  Majestic rich and rare;
If but a moment from his foes
  A slave found refuge there.
That moment burst the captive’s chain!
  That moment!— he was free!—
No king, or lord had power again,
  To alter that decree.

4. That was two thousand years ago,
  And CHRIST had not yet come,
To preace good will to all below
  And strike the Pagans dumb;
Oh! would to God! within our Land,
  That boasts full many a shrine,
Some Temple, tower or fane might rise,
  Fair Greece, to equal thine.
