I shot and arrow into the Air, 
It fell to earth I know not where; 
For so swiftly it flew, the sight, 
Could not follow it in its flight! 

I breathed a song into the Air, 
It fell to earth I know not where; 
For who has sight so keen and strong, 
That it can follow the flight of song? 

Long, long afterwards in an oak, 
I found the arrow still unbroke; 
And the song, from beginning to end, 
I found again in the heart of a friend. 
And the song, from beginning, from beginning to end, 
I found again in the heart of a friend. 
And the song from beginning, from beginning to end, 
I found again in the heart of a friend.
