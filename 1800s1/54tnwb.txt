1. Topsy neber was born—
Neber had a mudder—
S’pose I grow’d a niggar brat
Just like any oder:
Whip me ’till the blood pours down,
Ole missus used to do it,
She said she’d cut my heart right out,
But neber could get to it.
I’se got no heart I do belief,
Niggars do widout ’em;
Neber heard of God or love,
So can’t tell much about dem.

2. I specs I’se bery wicked—
Dats just what I am—
Ony you just gave me chance,
Wont I rouse ole Sam?
’Taint no use in bein’ good,
Case I brack your see,
I neber cared for nuffin yet,
And nuffin cares for me.
Ha! ha! ha! ha! Miss Fely’s hand
Don know how to grip me,—
Neber likes to do no work,
And wont widout dey whip me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
This is Topsy’s savage song,
Topsy cute and clever
Hurra! hurra for the white man’s right
Slavery forever!
Hurra! hurra for the white man’s right,
Slavery forever!

2. Dont you die Mis Eva—
Else I go dead too
I know I’se wicked, but I’ll try
And be all good to you—
You have taught me better things,
Though I’se niggar skin,
You have found poor Topsy’s heart,
Spite of all its sin,
Dont you die Miss Eva dear,
Else I go dead too
Tho¦ I’se black, I’se sure that God
Will let me go wid you.
