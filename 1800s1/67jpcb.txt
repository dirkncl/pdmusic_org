1. Oh, I’m going to sing a song to you about Juliana Brown, 
She was the prettiest yaller gal was ever in the town; 
She had eyes so bright and teeth so white, like diamonds they did shine, 
And such a lovely foot she had, she wore a number nine.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For she look’d so sweet 
And she dress’d so sweet. 
Of all the pretty yaller gals was ever in the town, 
It's my Juliana Phebiana Constantina Brown.

2. Oh, the first time that I saw her, she was dressed up to the teeth,
The look that she then gave me nearly took away my breath;
I asked her if she would only be true to me
And when I’d sell my Poodle Dog, a married we should be.

3. Its my Juliana Phebiana Constantina Brown,
She was the prettiest dancer, for miles and miles around;
For when we went to balls her like was never seen,
For she was sure to be the Belle and I the Ballerine.
