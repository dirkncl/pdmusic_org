1. On a sunny summer morning, early,
  As the dew was dry,
Up the hill I went aberrying;
  Need I tell you, tell you why?
Farmer Davis had a daughter,
  And it happened that I knew,
On each sunny morning, Jenny,
  Up the hill went berrying too.
Lonely work is picking berries,
  So I join’d her on the hill;
“Jennie, dear,” said I, “your basket’s
  Quite too large for one to fill;”
So we staid, we two, to fill it,
  Jenny talking, I was still,
Leading where the hill was steep,
  Picking berries up the hill.
Picking berries up the hill.

2. “This is up hill work,” said Jenny,
  “So is life,” said I, “shall we
Climb it up alone, or, Jenny,
  Will you come and climb with me?”
Redder than the blushing berries,
  Jenny’s cheeks a moment grew,
While without delay, she answered,
  “I will come and climb with you;
While without delay, she answered,
  “I will come and climb with you.
