1. Forth from its scabbard, pure and bright 
Flash’d the sword of Robert Lee! 
Far in the front of the deadly fight, 
High o’er the brave, in the cause of right, 
It’s stainless sheen, like a beacon light, 
Led us to vic tory. 
Led us to victory. 
Led us to victory. 

2. Out of its scabbard, when full long 
It slumbered  peacefully— 
Rouse’s from its rest by the battle song, 
Shielding the feeble, smiting the strong; 
Rewarding the right, avenging the wrong 
Gleamed the sword of Lee! 
Gleamed the sword of Lee! 
Gleamed the sword of Lee. 

3. Forth from its scabbard, high in air 
Beneath Virginia’s sky 
And they who saw it gleaming there, 
And knew who bore it, knelt to swear, 
That where the sword led they would dare 
To follow and to die. 
To follow and to die. 
To follow and to die. 

4. Out of its scabbard! never hand 
Wav’d sword from strain as free, 
Nor purer sword led braver hand, 
Nor braver bled for a brighter land, 
Nor brighter land had cause so grand, 
Nor cause a chief like Lee! 
Nor cause a chief like Lee! 
Nor cause a chief like Lee!

5. Forth from its scabbard! how we pray’d 
That sword might victor he! 
And when our triumph was delayed, 
Many a heart grew  sore afraid, 
We still hoped on while gleamed the blade 
Of noble Robert Lee! 
Of noble Robert Lee! 
Of noble Robert Lee!

6. Forth from its scabbard! all in vain! 
Forth flash’d the  sword of Lee! 
’Tis shrouded now in its sheath again, 
It sleeps the  sleep of noble slain, 
Defeated yet with out a slain, 
Proudly and peacefully! 
Proudly and peacefully! 
Proudly and peacefully!
