The stars shine on his pathway,
The trees bend back their leaves,
To guide him to the meadows
Among the golden sheaves
Where stand I, longing, loving,
And listing, as I wait,
To the nightingale's wild singing,
Sweet singing to its mate,
Singing, Singing,
Sweet singing to its mate.
Ah! Ah! Ah!

The breeze comes sweet from heav'n,
And the music in the air,
Heralds my lover's coming,
And tells me he is there,
And tells me he is there!
Come, for my arms are empty.
Come, for the day was long!
Turn the darkness into glory,
The sorrow into song!

I hear his footfall's music,
I feel his presence near,
All my soul responsive answers,
And tells me he is here.
O stars, shine out your brightest,
O nightingale, sing sweet,
To guide him to me, waiting,
And speed his flying feet,
  To guide him to me, waiting,
  And speed his flying feet.
