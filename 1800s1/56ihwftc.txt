1.
I have waited for thy coming,
As the flow'ret for the dew,
As the swallow for the Springtime,
Or the lark, for morns bright blue;
I have waited in the starlight,
On the spot where oft we met,
I have linger'd in the moontide,
But I'm lonely, lonely yet.

By the streamlet and the fountain,
In the valley, on the hill;
I have waited for thy coming,
Thou hast left me lonely still,
I have waited for thy coming,
Thou hast left me lonely still.
Thou hast left me lonely still.

2.
I have waited for thy coming,
Night by night, and day by day,
For I'm happy when thou'rt near me,
But I'm sad when thou'rt away,
In my dreams alone I view thee,
But they only bring me pain;
For too soon the spell is broken
And I wake to watch again.

By the streamlet and the fountain,
In the valley, on the hill,
I have waited for thy coming,
Do not leave me lonely still,
I have waited for thy coming,
Do not leave me lonely still,
Do not leave me lonely still.
