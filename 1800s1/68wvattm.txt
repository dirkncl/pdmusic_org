1. Oh, how we suffer, maids and wives, 
Although our wants are very slight; 
How sad and dreary pass our lives, 
Now who can say it’s right? 
We’re snubbed at night and we’re snubbed at morn, 
And looked upon the same as slaves; 
We’re treated oft with contempt and scorn, 
By the men, the cruel knaves, 
Oh,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sad is the life of womankind, 
Tred under foot we’ve always been, 
But when we vote, you soon will find 
That we’ll fix these “terrible men.”

2. There’s Mister Beady’s pretty wife, 
Although she lives in queenly style, 
I know she leads a wretched life, 
She seems sad all  the while; 
It’s true she rides in her carriage fine, 
And buys six dresses ev’ry week, 
It’s true she “gads about” all the time, 
But of trifles we’ll not speak, 
For

3. Of course we know each word is false, 
That’s said of Mistress William Brown, 
That she so dearly loves to walk 
And flirt about  the town; 
They say she leaves Mister B. alone, 
And out to “suffrage circles” gones, 
While he the little ones rocks at home, 
Which I’m sure quite plainly shows, 
That

4. And when you hear my own sad case, 
I know your hearts will bleed  for me; 
You can tell by my thin, careworn face, 
How wretched I  must be; 
My husband gives me  but once a week, 
A hundred dollar bill to spend; 
Of such cruelty I’ll no farther speak, 
But won’t stand it long, depend, 
Oh,
