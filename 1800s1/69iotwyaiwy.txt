1. In olden times when you and I were young,
When we would wander side by side,
When the wild woods without laughter rung,.
When our wild spirits care defied,
Those bright days will ne’er return again
For they’ve faded in the past
And our love of all the joys we shared
That alone will ever last.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh I sigh for happy days of yore;
Weep for lov’d ones who have gone
But they’ve left us for a brighter shore
And a happier home.

2. In olden times when pleaant days were ours
Fast flew the hours in happiness
When our path was only strewn with flow’rs
When life was to us one caress
Old loved features smiles whene’er we met
Friendly eyes would light our ways
But we’er nothing left but sad regret
Longings for the olden days.

3. In olden times we sang our simple lays
To her whom we of all loved best.
Sweet they were with all their girlish ways
While we in blushes stood confessed
But the eyes that beam’d so lovingly
Now are closed for evermore
And there’s only left but you and I.
All the rest have gone before.
