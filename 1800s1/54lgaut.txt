"Little Gerty and Uncle True" (1854)
Ballad
from the
Lamplighter
Words by
Miss M. A. Collier
Music by
Luther Orlando Emerson

True looked at Gerty in perfect wonder and diistress,--
He could not leave her there, such a cold night; 
but he hardly knew what he could do with her if he took
her home, for he lived alone, and was poor.
But another violent coughing spell decided him at once
to share wiith her his shelter, fire and food, for one night
at least. So he took her by the hand, saying, "Come with me;"
and Gerty ran along confidently by his side, never asking whither.--

1. Homeward the old man led the child, 
When stars were bid by tempests wild. 
The weary, wand’ring one had rest 
Secure within a sheltered nest. 
A joy is by the lowly hearth, 
A light, a song, a voice of mirth; 
As plumes of gold from angel wings, 
The outcast child a blessing brings. 
  As plumes of gold  from angel wings, 
  The outcast child a blessing brings. 

2. A change! the strong man bendeth low,— 
Palsied his hand and pale his brow. 
Who guides his failing footsteps on? 
The orphan girl that rescued one. 
Her tears his hand had wiped away, 
With love she paid him day by day; 
The lowly child he sought to save, 
She planted flowers upop his grave. 
  The lowly child he sought to save, 
  She planted flowers upon his grave.
