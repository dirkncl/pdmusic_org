1. ’Tis years since last we met, 
And we may not meet  again; 
I have struggled to forget, 
But the struggle was in vain; 
For her voice lives on the breeze, 
And her spirit comes at will; 
In the midnight, on the seas, 
Her bright smile haunts me still! 
For her voice lives on the breeze, 
And her spirit comes at will; 
In the midnight, on the seas, 
Her bright smile haunts me still. 

2. As the first sweet dawn of light, 
When I gaze upon the deep, 
Her form still greets my sight, 
While the stars their vigils keep; 
When I close mine aching eyes, 
Sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And from sleep when I arise, 
Her bright smile haunts me still! 
When I close mine aching eyes, 
Sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And from sleep when I arise, 
Her bright smile haunts me still. 

3. I have sail’d ’neath alien skies, 
I have trod the desert path, 
I have seen the storm arise, 
Like a giant in his wrath; 
Ev’ry danger I have known, 
That a reckless life can fill; 
Yet her presence is not flown, 
Her bright smile haunts me still! 
Ev’ry danger I have known, 
That a reckless life can fill; 
Yet her presence is not flown, 
Her bright smile haunts me still.
