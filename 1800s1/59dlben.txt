1. Where the placid little stream
Seems to murmur in a dream,
As it wanders through the shady dell;
Where the broken sunbeams fall,
And soft shadows are her pall,
Have we laid our little blueeyed Nell;
And above her little grave
Doth the weeping willow wave,
And the daisy and the sweet blue bell;
And the water’s bubbling gush,
And the sweet notes of the thrush,
Are the requiems of our blueeyed Nell.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Where the placid little stream
Seems to murmur in a dream,
As it wanders through the shady dell;
Where the broken sunbeams fall,
And soft shadows are her pall,
Have we laid our darling blueeyed Nell.

2. And the bird doth wait in vain
For her gentle voice again;
And the flowers that she loved so well,
Hang their tender heads and die
For their mistress in the sky,
For their darling little blueeyed Nell;
Oh! it was a placid day,
Rich in cloud and sunny ray,
And the mellow radiance o’er her fell,
As with neither tear nor sigh,
Her sweet spirit mounted high,
Thou’rt an angel now, our blueeyed Nell.
