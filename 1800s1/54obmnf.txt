1. Oh bid me not forget love
Oh bid me not forget
The many hours we’ve spent love
When the sun was near its set;
When the stars thro’ darkness peeping
And the moon in beauty rose,
And the dew was gently weeping
In the daylight’s pensive close.
Oh bid me not forget love,
Oh bid me not forget.

2. Oh bid me no forget love
When far away I roam,
My heart will turn to thee love
As the wand’rer to his home;
As the flowers bloom in spring
As the roses shed perfume,
So my heart will turn to thee love
In sunshine or in gloom.
Oh bid me not forget love
Oh bid me not forget.
