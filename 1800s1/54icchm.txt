1. The marriage rite is over, 
  And though I turn’d aside, 
To keep the guests from seeing 
  The tears I could not hide; 
I wreath’d my face in smiling, 
  And led my little brother 
To greet my father’s chosen, 
  But I could not her her mother.

2. She is a fair young creature, 
  With meek and gentle air, 
With blue eyes soft and loving, 
  And silken sunny hair— 
I know my father gives her 
  The love he bore another, 
But of she were an angel 
  I could never call her mother.

3. To night I heard her singing
  A song I used to love,
When its sweet notes were uttered
  By her who sings above;
It pained my heart to hear it,
  And my tears I could not smother,
For every word was hallowed
  By the dear voice of my mother.

4. My father, in the sunshine
  Of happy days to come,
May half forget the shadow
  That darkened our old home;
His heart no more is lonely,
  But me and little brother
Must still be orphan children,
  God can give us but one mother.

5. They’ve borne my mother’s picture
  From its accustomed place,
And set beside my father’s 
  A younger fairer face;
They’ve made her dear old chamber
  That boudoir of another,
But I will not forget thee
  My own, my angel mother.
