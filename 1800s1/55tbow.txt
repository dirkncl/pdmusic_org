1. All hail to the day let us hallow the morn 
Let nations rejoice that our hero was born, 
For cloudless and bright were the beams of that sun 
Whose splendor has shone on our great Washington.

As the light of that morn o’er Columbia doth rise 
Let the name of our Chief rise from earth, air and skies, 
For a hero a statesman, a sage all in one, 
We obtained by the birth of our great Washington.

2. When thousands of Britins invaded the land 
Our country elected him first in command, 
The first and the best— shall there ever be one 
More devoted and true than our great Washington.

Then louder still louder our cannon shall roar 
Let our banner wave high over ocean and shore, 
Until time is no more and the world’s glass is run, 
Will we hail the birthday of the great Washington.
