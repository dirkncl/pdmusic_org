1. O’er massa’s grave the willows weeping
And I weep too
Under the green sod he is sleeping
Oh bitter bitter woe
He gave me my freedom e’er he ’parted
What use that freedom now to me!
Oh darkies I am broken hearted
Dear massa I never more shall see.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
But if it could have been my lot
To sleep on earth’s cold pillow
And dying rest in massa’s stead
Beneath the weeping willow.

2. My poor massa’s children now are kneeling,
  Lisping a prayer.
Cruel and painful is the feeling
  To look on them there.
So true and kind was dear old master,
  Better a man could hardly be!
Tear upon tear comes falling faster,
  Ev’ry time I rest beside that tree.

3. Dark night is now around me stealing
  Gloom every where.
Stronger and stronger grows the feeling
  I cannot rest here!
Yet e’re I leave this well loved dwelling,
  One prayer I’ll offer up for thee
Sad thoughts within my breast keep swelling,
  Hard times are now in store for me.
