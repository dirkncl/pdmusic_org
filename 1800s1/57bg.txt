1. Oft when evening steals around us,
And the daylight blushing dies;
Do I wander sad and lonely,
To the spot where Bessie lies;
Where the weeping willows branches,
Bendeth low around her grave,
Sleeps the one I loved and cherished,
But no earthly pow’r could save.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Now in solitude I wander,
Where the santee’s waters wave;
But my heart alas is buried,
In my darling Bessie’s grave.

2. When the daylight faded ’round us,
And the mellow air of ev’n,
Wafted perfume on our pathway,
Lighted by the stars of heav’n;
Here we wander’d where the willows
Hanging branches sweep the ground,
And my darling Bessie’s warbling
Made sweet music all around.

3. But the love in which I revelled,
Was too short, too sweet to last,
And poor Bessie’s wasted figure,
Show’d too plain the die was cast;
And we buried her where often,
We had wander’d in our glee,
And my darling Bessie sleepeth,
Sweetly ’neath the willow tree.
