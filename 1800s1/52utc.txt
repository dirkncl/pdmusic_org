1.
Deep in a grove, where sweetest flow'rs were blowing,
  Our cabin stood unharm'd by sorrows gale.
The river deep was past our dwelling flowing,
  On whose clear wave we spread our merry sail.

[DUETT]
I'll never leave thee ne'er will I roam.
Oh! how I love my own dear Cabin Home.

[QUARTETT]
I'll never leave thee ne'er will I roam.
Oh! how I love my own dear Cabin Home.

2.
Oh! how my heart for my fond ones was beating,
  Each claim'd the love a fathers heart knew well;
We had no care-- for happy was our meeting,
  Why should we ever know a sad farewell!

(DUETT)
(QUARTETTE)

3.
Oft round the door when stars were shining brightly,
  Happy we pass'd the summers evening hours;
We play'd the banjo, sung and tripp'd it lightly,
  Over the green bedeck'd with sweetest flowers.

(DUETT)
(QUARTTETE)

4.
Gaily we danced when e'er the banjo tumming,
  Fill'd every heart with pleasure and delight;
Loudly we heard the old tambo drumming,
  And every heart pass'd merrily the night.

(DUETT)
(QUARTTETE)

5.
I now am old but o'er the Past I ponder,
  Happy to see the sports I loved of yore;
Through the bananna groves I love to wander,
  Sad that they'll soon wave over me no more!

(DUETT)
(QUARTTETE)
