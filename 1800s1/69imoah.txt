1. O’er Arlington Hights, now the shadows are creeping
  While the sentinel stars keep watch o’er the graves
Of the heroes who there for their country are sleeping;;
  On the spot which has often been tilled by the slave.

CHORUS 1-3.
Hushed be the voices, and silent the tread;
Chant we a dirge now in sad minor tone;
“Arlington Hights” is the home of our dead,
While in hundreds of graves, sleep soldiers “Unknown.”

2. “Unknown” are the graves of those who sleep here,
  Yet we lovingly laurel their green mossy bed;
And we yield for their loved ones a prayer and a tear,
  And in sorrow and silence thank God for our dead.

3. God knows them— our loved ones— who trusted in him,
  And went to the death, friends, for Country and thee.
Let hope ne’er desert you, nor faith e’er grow dim,
  He will help you to bear this sad victory.
