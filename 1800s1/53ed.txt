1. De anchor’s weigh’d, I must go—
  Ella don’t you cry;
I’ll come back again you know,
  Ella don’t you sigh.
I’se gwine off to Florida,
  Dar to chop a tree;
And when I am far away,
  Lub remember me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Farewell Ella, good bye my dear—
I am comin’ back again, Ella neber fear.

2. If I was wid you all de time—
  Ella don’t you cry;
You know we shouldn’t have a dime,
  Ella don’t you sigh.
Goodbye Thomas, Ephe and Bob;
  When I come from sea,
Wid my wages in my fob,
  Won’t we have a spree!

3. Dar’s de wind and now we start—
  Ella don’t you cry;
Kiss me once before we part,
  Ella don’t you sigh.
In my hammock I will swing
  On the waters blue,
Happier dan any king,
  Thinkin’ lub, of you.
