"The Miller's Will" (1854)
Comic Song
Written and Composed
by Stump Town

1.
There was an old man once own'd a mill,
And when he was dying he made his will,
And all were present to his oldest son
And these were the words that fell from his tongue.

2.
He call'd unto him his eldest son
Saying son my glass is almost run,
If I my will to you do leave,
What toll do you intend to have?

3.
Father he says my name is Jack.
Out of a bushel I'll take a peek;
And if your Mill to me should leave,
I'm sure a good living I will have.

4.
He call'd unto him his second son,
Saying son my glass is almost run.
If I my Mill to you do leave
What toll do you intend to have?

5.
Father he says, my name is Ralph,
Out of a bushell, I'll take a half;
And if your mill to me should leave,
I'm sure a good living I will have.

6.
He call'd unto him, his youngest son,
Saying Son my glass is almost run,
If I my Mill to you do leave
What toll do you intend to have?

7.
Father says he, I am your Boy,
And as taking toll is all my joy;
I'll neither do like Ralph, or Jack,
"But I'll take all their corn and give them the sack."

8.
You are my Boy, the old man cried,
My favorite Son, he sadly sigh'd,
"And I my Mill to you will leave,
I'm sure a good living, _You_ will have."
