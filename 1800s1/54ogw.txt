1. Whisper that gentle word once more,
It seemed an echo from above,
Its angel tones my bosom thrill’d
’Twas sweet indeed it told of love
A thrill of transport near my heart,
With lingering fondness seemed to stay,
Whisper that gentle word once more,
And brighten Hope’s declining ray.
Whisper that gentle word once more,
And brighten Hope’s declining ray.

2. The witch’ry of that gentle word
Breath’d in its tone a sweet delight
Its magic spell of loveliness
Would change today the darkest night
Thy dreamy glance might captivate
But then thy voice had not been heard;
Who would resist its passionings
The whisper of one gentle word
Who would resist its passionings
The whisper of on gentle word.
