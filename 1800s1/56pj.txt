1. Pearl river side is far away 
In the old Mississippi state. 
And our old cabin stands alone, 
With Juna at the gate. 
I told her I must go away, 
That I should not be out late, 
And Juna stands with tearful eye, 
To meet me at the gate.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Our old cabin stands upon the stream 
In the old Mississippi state; 
And I must quickly hurry home, 
To take poor Juna from the gate.

2. O Juna was a simple child,
Had pretty shining curls;
And the white folks loved her best of all
The young mulatto girls;
’Twas wrong in me to leave her so,
In the old Mississippi state;
And I must quickly hurry home,
To take poor Juna from the gate.

3. If you should ever travel to the south,
In the old Mississippi state,
Don’t fail to find the cabin out,
With Juna at the gate;
Tell her to wait a little while;
Tell her, in hope, to wait;
Tell her that I will break the chains,
That bind her to the gate.
