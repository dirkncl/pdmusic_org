1. Hopes of freemen e’er will cluster,
Where Potomac’s waters glide;
Where beneath the shades of Vernon
Sleeps our noble country’s pride.
’Tis no fane where monarchs slumber,
Nor where mystic heroes dwell,
Nor yet where the conqueror’s trophies
Hang, of cruel deeds to tell.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let no desecrating footsteps
E’er that soil of freedom tread.
’Tis the holy ground of nations
Where repose their hallowed dead.
Let no desecrating footsteps
E’er that soil of freedom tread.
’Tis the holy ground of nations
Where repose their hallowed dead.

2. Hearts of freemen, ever beating
Funeral dirge ’round the grave,
Stand as sentinels forever;
And those hearts are strong and brave.
Gold, nor threats, nor mad ambition
E’er can bribe a warrior there,
For they stand as one united,
Death or freedom sworn to share.

3. Sleep then chieftain mid’st thy glory,
Nor let future ages show
That the watchfires thou hast kindled,
E’er on freedom ceas’d to glow.
Then around thy tomb on Vernon
Millions yet unborn shall bring
Tributes of their lasting homage
And the World thy virtues sing.
