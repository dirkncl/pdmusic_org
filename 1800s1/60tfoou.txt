1. Raise the flag of freedom high, 
Loose the folds and let it fly, 
Let it wave o’er land and sea, 
Emblem of the brave and free, 
Let it wave in peace or war, 
O’er the Soldier and the Tar, 
Tho’ in death released they be 
In coral grave or cemetry.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Wave it o’er the smiling plain, 
Wave it o’er the boundless Main, 
Until time shall be no more, 
Wave it on Columbia’s shore, 
Wave it on Columbia’s shore.

2. Wave it now o’er spire and dome, 
O’er the freeman’s happy home, 
Where in peace he rests from harm, 
Till the bugle sounds th’alarm, 
Wave it now o’er battlefield, 
Where the foe is forced to yield, 
Freemen dying long to see 
The Idol of the brave and free.
