1. When the storm is abroad on the plains of the world, 
And clouds break their chains on the hills, 
When the wing of the blast o’er the deep in unfurl’d, 
And terror the human heart thrills.

CHORUS 1
’Tis then that I fly to me eyrie on high, 
And gaze on the battle of billow and sky, 
I laugh in my glee while the elements rave, 
And they call me the bird of the brave, 
And the call me the bird of the brave.

2. When Liberty looks on the woes of the world,
Thro’ clouds of oppression and crime
When tyrants and knaves from their high trones are hurled,
And men burst the fetters of Time,

CHORUS 2
’Tis then that I rise on the death rolling night
And strike for the brave in the battle of Right,
I laugh as the legions of tyranny flee,
And they call me the bird of the free.
And they call me the bird of the free.
