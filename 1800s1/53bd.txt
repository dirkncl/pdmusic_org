1.
Ah! Bella Due I love thee yet,
My heart still beats for thee,
Tho' youth has past, and I am old,
Yet thou are dear to me,
Tho' youth has past, and I am old,
Yet thou art dear, art dear to me.

2.
My thoughts oft fly to years "lang syne,"
WHen those wert by my side,
And whisper'd in sweet accents thine,
That thou wouldst be me bride.
And whisper'd in sweet accents thine,
That thou would'st be, would'st be my bride.

3.
But now alas! those years have fled,
And I am yet alone,
But still my love I dream of thee, 
My heart is all thine own,
But still my love I dream of thee
My heart is all thine own.

4.
Adieu my love, adieu to night,
I fondly turn to thee,
And hope that joy may bless thy heart,
What e'er my fate may be,
And hope thay joy may bless thy heart,
What e'er my fate, my fate may be.
