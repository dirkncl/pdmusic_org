1. With this humble stock in store,
  Which is not mine own;
I your patronage implore
  For the sad and lone,
List to little Julia’s cry:
  Buy my Strawberries come buy!
List to little Julia’s cry:
Buy my strawberries come buy.

2. Cheer’d by that good woman’s face,
  Loaded from that hand,
Which I found in market place,
  Here I’ll take my stand,
And beseech those passing nigh,
  Flow’rs and Strawberries to buy!
And beseech those passing nigh,
Flow’rs and Strawberries to buy.

3. Let an only grandchild’s prayer,
  Brave in duty’s part
Raise the sympathetic tear,
  Move the friendly heart;
Aged grandparents alone,
  Hungry wait for me at home.
Aged grandparents alone,
Hungry wait for me at home.

4. While they’res wretched weak and poor,
  Begging’s not so mean.
They can’t go from door to door
  Childish tho’ I seem
All their wants I can supply,—
  Quickly then my Strawberries buy.
All their wants I can supply,—
Quickly then my Strawberries buy.
