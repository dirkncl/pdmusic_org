They say that thou art poor, Louise! 
And so I know thou art! 
But what is wealth to noble minds, 
Or riches in the heart! 
With all the wealth of India’s mines, 
Can one great deed be bought? 
Or can a kingdom’s ransom bring, 
One pure, and holy! thought? 
One pure, and holy! holy! thought, 
One pure, and holy! thought. 
No! vain your boasted treasurer, 
Though earth to gold is giv’n, 
Gold, at this hour divine love, 
To holy echoes giv’n, 
Let thy true vows and mine love, 
Be register’d in heav’n! 
Let thy true vows and mine, love, 
Be register’d in heav’n!
