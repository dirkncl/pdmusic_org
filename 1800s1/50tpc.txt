1.
On the lake by the woodland when the pale moon is shining,
A dusky form paddles a Phantom canoe
Oh why did she list to false Womba's designing
And why did she fail to be constant and true?
  Oh! list, darkies, list to this sad tale
  And then poor Gambia's fate bewail,
  List list list list.

2.
He was Chief of his kindred his arrow was fame
There was might in his forehead, there was death in his aim;
He courted the maid, in her beauty and pride,
In war and in wigwam he watch'd by her side.
  Oh! list, darkies, list to this sad tale
  And then poor Gambia's fate bewail,
  List list list list.

3.
She left him and fled with a rival
Whose hate had long cure'd the chieftan
Ah! sad was his fate
In his frenzy he plunged his sad bosom so true,
In the lake where the Phantom now guides the canoe.
  Oh! weep darkies, weep at this sad tale,
  And then poor Gambia's fate bewail.

  Oh! poor Gambia farewell
  Gambia farewell
  Ah me.
