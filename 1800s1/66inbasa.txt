1. I’ll never be a slave again, 
Nor bend the knee to man, 
No more I’ll wear the clanking chain, 
Nor live beneath the ban; 
I’ve hoped, through years of toil and care, 
To see this golden hour. 
And now I breath sweet Freedom’s air, 
And feel its holy pow’r.

 2. I fought beneath the dear old flag 
For freedom, peace and right, 
And saw the dark clouds roll away 
Before our country’s might; 
And now that I am truly free 
Upon Columbia’s shore, 
A slave I never more will be 
As in dark days of yore.

3. I’ll never be a slave again 
To wine and all its wiles 
I see the demon ’neath the mask 
And do not feed its smiles; 
I’ll have no master on the earth 
I’ll yield to nought but love, 
That I may live and die to please 
The One who rules above.

I’ll live and die for our old flag, 
Yes! ever shall it reign 
I’ll never see its splendor fade, 
Nor be a slave again.
