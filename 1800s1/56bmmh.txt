1.
Bring me my harp, that I may wake 
Old chords of byegone hours: 
My fairy bark upon the lake, 
The banks of golden flow'rs; 
The cheerful fire that burst so bright 
Upon my father's hearth, 
Affection's look of starry light 
Which beam'd upon my birth. 
  Affection's look of starry light 
  Which beam'd upon my birth. 

2.
Aid me my harp, that I may sing 
The strain she lov'd to hear, 
Altho' from out this heart, it wring 
At ev'ry note a tear:
Those tears so sweet, oh, do not chide 
Nor offer joys relief, 
For know to calm sad mem'ry's tide, 
There is no joy like grief. 
  For know to dim sad mem'ry's tide, 
  There is no joy like grief.
