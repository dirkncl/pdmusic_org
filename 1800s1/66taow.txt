1. What a wonderful age ’tis we livein!
What occasions for wonder and awe!
I fear that the world’s going crazy,
In spite of all reason and law;
The country is full of contention,
Speculation the wildest e’er seen,
We’ve the cuds of the earth tied together,
And perform all our duties by steam.

CHOURS [sung after each VERSE]
Good people look out for your senses.
Each day some news wonder will bring,
And stand by our triple hued banner,
For we’ve got the whole world on the string.

2. The North and the South raised a question,
Which neither could see in that light,
Whether white men’s as good as a nigger!
Or niger as good as a white?
The matter was settled by fighting,
For years they terribly fought,
The result was, that white man or nigger,
Was only a difference in thought.

3. John Bull! he came to their rescue,
On the pages of His’try it stands,
But we fought, and thrashed them like blazes,
With our Mudsills and Contrabands,
Internal, infernal! the taxes,
That take all our money away,
It seems’s if the devil was in it,
And he had come after his pay.

4. “Ould Ireland¨ has lifted her banner,
The harp with its bright golden sheen,
It has stirred up the great Brittish Lion,
Be cause it is “wearing the green!”
The Fenniann rally by legions!
By hearts true as steel they are led.
They will follow their emerald banner,
As in triumph it waves o’er the red!
