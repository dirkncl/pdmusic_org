1. Years ago, when rosy childhood
Lapped me in its dreams of bliss,
Then I heard a father’s accents,
Then I felt a mother’s kiss;
I was happy as the songbird,
Flitting to its secret nest;
Not a cloud, from morn till even,
Not a thorn within my breast,
[REFRAIN]
Not a cloud, form morn till even,
Not a thorn within my breast.

2. O! how well do I remember
What a smile my mother had!
How she laughed with me when merry,
How she wept with me when sad;
And my father fondly loved me,
As he never loved another,
Now alas! the turf is lying
On my father and my mother,
[REFRAIN]
Now alas! the turf is lying
On my father and my mother.

3. There are few on earth who love me;
O ’tis sad to dwell alone
But I hope to reach that country
Where my heart’s first friends are gone;
Let me wait without re pining,
Cheering every drooping brother,
’Till the wings of angels bear me
To my father and my mother
[REFRAIN]
’Till the wings od angels bear me
To my father and my mother.
