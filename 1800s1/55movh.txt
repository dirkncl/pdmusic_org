1. Around my old Virginia hom,
My heart forever clings;
Whene’er I hear thy name pronouced,
I think a thousand things;

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
My cherishged home, my happy home,
From thee my heart shall never roam,
My cherished home, my happy home,
My old Virginia home.

2. I think of all the kindly friends,
Who mid that home abide,
And of my grey hair’d Father there,
My Mother at his side:

3. I think of her, my gentle wife,
Whose bright and cloudless smile
Still beaming o’er that happy home,
Makes sunshine all the while:

4. My cherished, old Virginia home!
Tears, tears come to my eyes,
Whene’er I see, or think of thee,
Or dreams of thee arise:
