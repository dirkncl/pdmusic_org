1.
One night, while wandering,
Dis Darkie was pondering,--
Strange ideas squandering,
All over so, so.
When to strains irresistining
I found myself listening,
And, wid eyes glistening,
O'erhead a yound beau,
Who quite melancholy,
To a dark girl called Molly
Was singing Oh Polly,
Won't you try me, oh!
Try me, oh! try me, oh!
Won't you try me, oh!
Try me, oh! try me, oh!
Won't you try me, oh!

2.
Wid big lips pouting,
His love much doubting,
She bid him go scouting,
Nor near her be found.
Jealousy was lurking,
Her love for him burking,
In spite of his smirking,
He could not gain ground.
If she guess'd rightly,
He had quite sprightly,
Wid Other girls nightly
Been bobbin' around,
Around, around,
Been bobbin' around;
Around, around,
Been bobbin' around.

3.
A rage den he splash'd in,
A big oath he dash'd in,
His best tile smash'd in
And look'd pale and wan!
While she, in her sleeve, oh!
Grinn'd to see him grieve, oh!
His bosom did heave, oh!
Till he, like a man,
Said, "No more I'll flatter,
Farewell,-- you may chatter;
I'm off, like a hatter,
To my Mary Ann;
Mary Ann, Mary Ann,
To my Mary Ann;
Mary Ann, Mary Ann,
To my Mary Ann!
