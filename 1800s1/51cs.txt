1. 
Sweet and low, sweet and low. 
Wind of the western sea 
Low, low breathe and blow 
Wind of the western sea 
Over the rolling waters go 
Come from the droping moon, and blow 
Blow him again again to me 
While my little one sleeps 
While my pretty one sleeps.

2. 
Sleep and rest, sleep and rest, 
Father will come to thee soon; 
Rest rest on mothers breast 
Father will come to thee soon 
Father will come to the babe in his nest 
silver sails all out of the west 
Under the moon the silver moon 
Sleep my little one sleep 
Sleep my pretty one sleep.
