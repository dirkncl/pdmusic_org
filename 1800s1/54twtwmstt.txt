1.
The winds that waft my sighs to thee,
And o'er thy tresses steal;
Oh! let them tell a tale for me,
My lips dare not reveal!
And as they murmur soft and clear
The love I would impart;
Believe the whispers thou dost hear
Are breathings of my heart.
  Believe the whispers thou dost hear
  Are breathings of my heart.

2.
Yet if perchance their mission fail
Thy coldness to remove,
And night winds with their plaintive wail
Bring back my prefere'd love!
Then think, whene'er thou look'st on high
And see'st the light depart;
Those clouds, storm driven o'er the sky,
Are shadows of my heart,
  Those clouds, storm driven o'er the sky,
  Are shadows of my heart.
    Those clouds, storm driven o'er the sky,
    Are shadows of my heart.
