1. 
I'm leaning o'er the gate Annie, 
'Neath the cottage wall; 
The grey dawn breaks, the hour grows late-- 
I hear the trumpet's call; 
I could not brook thy cheek so pale, 
The sad tear in thine eye,-- 
This heart which laughs at war might quail, 
So Annie dear, goodbye! 
  This heart which laughs at war might quail, 
  So Annie dear, goodbye!

2. 
I'm marching with the brave, Annie! 
Far from home and thee, 
To win renown, perhaps a grave, 
A glorious one 'twill be! 
But whatsoe'er the fate I meet, 
To conquer, or to die! 
This heart's last throb for thee will beat; 
So Annie dear, goodbye! 
  This heart's last throb for thee will beat; 
  So Annie dear, goodbye!
