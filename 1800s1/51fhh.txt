1. Bress dat lubly yallar gal, 
De white folks call miss Dinah; 
Oh! pity me ye shakers all 
And tell me where I’ll find her, 
She’s gone away to Leb’non state 
To hoe de corn and bake de cake; 
Massa says it is too late 
Let her go to Leb’non state.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Fi hi hi hum i dum difle tum 
Fi hi hi ri tidli hum i dum 
Fi hi hi.

2. And since she’s gone and left me, 
I don’t know what I’ll do; 
I’'ll buy a rope and drown myself; 
Dat make her mad I know. 
She’s gone away to Leb’non stat, 
To hoe de corn and bake de cake; 
And Massa days it is too late. 
Let her go to Leb’non state.

[POLKA]
