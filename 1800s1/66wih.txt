1. Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
’Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
’Tis the Lord, the King of Glory,
At His feet, we humble fall,
Crown Him, Crown Him, Lord of all.

2. Who is He in yonder cot,
Bending to His toilsome lot?

3. Who is He who stands and weeps
At the grave where Laz’rus sleeps?

4. Who is He in deep distress,
Fastting in the wilderness?

5. Lo at midnight who is He,
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

6. Who is He in Calv’ry’s throes,
Asks for blessings on His foes?

7. Who is He that from the grave
Comes to heal, and help and save?

8. Who is He that on yon Throne,
Rules the world of light alone?
