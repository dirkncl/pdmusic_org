1.
On the banks of the Hudson
There lives a fair maid,
The pride of all hearts Jennie Bell;
I have sat for long hours
’Neath the chestnut’s deep shade
List’ning to thy sweet voice Jennie Bell.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Thou star of my heart
How lone seems the hour
When absent from thee
My own sweet Jennie Bell!
I miss thy step, thy kind sweet tone,
My dear blueeyed love Jennie Bell.

2.
The sun shines forth brighter,
The lawn seems more green,
When thou dost appear Jennie Bell;
The birds seem to love thee,
And the winds kiss thy curls,
My dear blueeyedlove Jennie Bell.

3.
The herd as they gather
At night in the yard,
All low when they see Jennie Bell;
The birds and the herd
Do but echo my heart,
For I love thee my sweet Jennie Bell.
