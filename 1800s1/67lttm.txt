    (Correspondent at Mt.Joy, to the Lancaster Inteligencer,
Lancaster Pa. March 1866.)   Pleasant Episode ___
    The Hutchinson Family, (Tribe of John) delighted a large
audience at this place on Wednsday evening with their rare
budget of songs, among them, one written by our fellow
tribesman, F.H. Stauffer, entitled "Lashed to the Mast."  At
the close of the concert Mr. Hutchinson, learning that the
author of the poem was present, insisted upon his coming
forward. "God bless you" he cried, taking Mr. S. warmly by the
hand, we have been singing that song all over the country, in
hospital and in camp— even before Com. Farragut himself.  "You
must write some more" Mr.S. was then introduced to the "Tribe
of John," bore his compliments meekly and promised to "write
some more" whenever the muses were propitious.

1. [Soprano Solo]
Past the sentinal forts
[Alto Solo]
Dash’d boldly the whips.
[Tenor Solo]
Guns belching forth fire.
[Bass Solo]
From their red hot lips.

CHORUS 1.
The crews sworn together
To stand to the last
By the brave Admirral,
Lashed to the mast,
By the brave Admirral,
Lashed to the mast.

CHORUS 2.
None cared for the danger,
And none stood agast,
Was not the Admirral,
Lashed to the mast?
Was not the Admirral,
Lashed to the mast?

CHORUS 3.
Ah, hail of hot iron,
Thick filling and fast,
Round the brave Admirral,
Lashed to the mast.
Bound the brave Admirral,
Lashed to the mast.

2. [Soprano Solo]
Amid the smoke fluttered
The stripes and the stars
Above the din was heard
The shouts of the lars;

3. [Soprano Solo]
The loud roar of the guns,
The shriek of the shell,
The air is filled with smoke,
And sulphurous smell.

4. [Bass Solo]
The deck of the flagship
Slippery with gore,
Thundering from ev’ry hugh
Gun that she bore.

CHORUS 4.
The Tecumseh went down
In a fearful blast,
Wept by the Admirral
Lashed to the mast,
Wept by the Admirral,
Lashed to the mast.

5. [Soprano Solo]
Oh, how it stirs the heart
Of loyal and leal,
To think of that fight
In the bay of Mobile,
When the Navy won laurels
More bright than the past.

6. [Soprano Solo]
The American Navy,
The best in the world,
The American Banner
The proudest unfurled,
The American Eagle,
Let cowards avast.

CHORUS 6.
Under Old Faragut,
Lashed to the mast.
Under Old Faragut,
Lashed to the mast.
