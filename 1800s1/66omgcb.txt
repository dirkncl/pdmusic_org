1. The day begins to dawn at last,
  Once more, and all together,
We’ll rout the traitors,— as the blast
  Strips trees in stormy weather,
Though long and sorrowful the night,
  Joy cometh in the morning,
Close up the ranks— stand firm, and Right
  Shall triumph with the dawning.

CHORUS [sung twice after VERSE]
Then one more gallant charge, boys,
  The day begins at dawn,
Follow the brave old flag, boys,
  Its stars shall light you on.

2. The good time’s coming, gallant men,
  Our country,— blessiings on her,
Shall come forth purified, and then 
  Who’ll dare assail her Never?
Her banner has protected us
  From foreign foes’ oppression,
Discharge the debt by rallying thus,
 ’Gainst traitor’s vile aggression.

3. Fill up the ranks, ye patriot braves,
  And while, with memories solemn,
You weep for those in martyrs’ graves—
  Oh! grasp their weapons fallen,
From false Virginia’s bloodstained shore,
  To Georgia, rent and riven,
We’ll strike— Hurrah! we’ll strike once more,
  And trust our cause to Heaven.
