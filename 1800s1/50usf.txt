1.
Of all the mighty nations
  In the east or in the west,
O this glorious yankee nation
  Is the greatest and the best,
We have room for all creation,
  And our banner is unfurl'd,
Here's a gen'ral invitation
  To the people of the world.

CHORUS
Then come along, come along, make no delay;
Come from ev'ry nation,
Come from ev'ry way,
Our lands, they are broad enough
Dont be alarm'd
For Uncle Sam is rich enough
To give us all a farm.

2.
St. Lawrence marks our Northern Pine
  As fast her waters flow;
And the Rio Grande our Southern bound,
  'Way down to Mexico.
From the great Atlantic Ocean
  Where the sun begins to dawn,
Leap across the Rocky mountains
  Far away to Oregon.

(CHORUS)

3.
While the South shall raise the Cotton,
  And the West, the Corn, and Pork,
New England Manufactories
  Shall do up the finer work;
For the deep and flowing waterfalls
  That course along our hills,
Are just the thing for washing Sheep,
  And driving Cotton Mills.

(CHORUS)

4.
Our father's gave us Libert,
  But little did they dream,
The grand results that pour along
  This mighty age of Steam;
For our mountains, lakes and rivers,
  Are all a blaze of fire,
And we send our news by lightning,
  On the telegraphic wires.

(CHORUS)

5.
Yes! we're bound to beat the nations
  For our motto's "Go ahead"
And we'll tell the foreign paupers
  That our people are well fed;
For the nations must remember
  That Uncle Sam is not a fool,
For the people do the voting,
  And the children go to school.

(CHORUS)
