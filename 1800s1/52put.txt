1.
A look of gloomy better sadness,
  Rests on every creature,
Gone is ev'ry sign of gladness,
  Joyless every feature;
Fore'd away ere scarce a warning,
  Came that we must sever,
With us at eve but er the maring,
  Tom was gone forever.

CHORUS [sung twice] 1
Poor Uncle Tom,
  Farewell for evermore.
Time will thy virtues tell,
  When life is o'er.

2.
He trod the steamer's deck dejected,
  And nought he thought could cheer him,
Still he was not by all neglected--
  A sweet child gambol'd near him,
And gazing on his face with sorrow,
  She kindly said-- "why sigh you,
Don't weep, and then perhaps tomorrow
  My father, dear will buy you."

CHORUS [sung twice] 2
Poor Uncle Tom,-- the voice,
  Of that young child
Made his lone heart rejoice--
  He sigh'd and smil'd.

3.
Hark, what a cry to heaven ascends,
  Eve, the palnter's little daughter,
Whose life on some swift aid depends,
  Now struggles in the water;
A bound -- a splah -- and old Tom leaping,
  Ahead of ev'ry other,
Rescues the child, and brings her weeping
  To her distracted mother.

CHORUS [sung twice] 3
Poor Tom is now at rest,
  In the dark grave,
And those who love him best,
  Mourn for the slave.
