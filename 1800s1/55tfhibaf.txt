(1.) When the lurid flame of night,
Lights up the clear blue sky
The fireman rouses in alarm
He sees the danger nigh.
Now hear the heavy wheels,
That rolls along the pave
Turn out! turn out!
The fireman cry,
The burning dwelling save.

(2.) Now the raging flame soars high,
The heav’ns look red and wild;
But, hark! a mother’s piercing cry:
Oh! save my darling child!
Oh! save my darling child!

(3.) Now streams the water high,
While from the ladder rais’d,
Is heard the gallant fireman’s cry—
The darling child is saved.

(4.) Quick moves the iron arm,
And rapid strikes the break,
The raging elements to calm,
To quench the firey flake.
But listen to the shout
From the noble fireman brave.
Our work is done—
The fire is out—
We’ve conquer’d and we’ve saved.

FULL CHORUS
Oh the fireman’s heart is bold and free,
His motto is to save,
He works without reward or fee,
Hurrah! for the fireman brave.

Partial CHORUS
Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Hurrah!
Break her down!
Break her down!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
