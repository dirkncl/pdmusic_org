1. Oh, tell me not the woods are fair,
Now spring is on her way;
Well, well I know how brightly there
In joy the young leaves play;
How sweet, on winds of morn or ever,
The violet's breath may be,
Yet ask me, woo me not to leave
My lone rock by the sea;
  Yet ask me, woo me not to leave
  My lone rock by the sea.

2. The wild wave's thunder on the shore,
The [curlew's?] restless cries,
Unto my watching heat are more
Than all earth's melodies.
Come back, my ocean rover, come!
There's but on place for me,
Till I can greet thy swift sail home --
My lone rock by the sea!
  Till I can greet thy swift sail home --
  My lone rock by the sea!
