1.
Lulu is our darling pride,
  Lulu bright, Lulu gay—
Dancing lightly, at our side,
  All the live long day.
Not a bird that wings the air,
  Soaring to the sun.
Freer is from ev’ry care,
  Than our darling one.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Luly is our darling pride,
Lulu bright, Lulu gay—
Dancing lightly at our side,
All the live long day.

2.
As the flow’rs of early spring
  Seem more gay, seem more bright,
As their perfume first they fling
  Fragrant at our feet;
So tho’ others lov’d there be
  Blooming in the bow’r.
Luly wins our hearts for she
  Is our loveliest flow’r

3.
When the clouds of trouble come,
  Lulu soothes all our care;
Ah! how dark would be our home,
  Were not Lulu there!—
Lulu, with here sunny smiles,
  Cheering every heart,
’Till each trouble she beguiles,
  And the clouds depart.
