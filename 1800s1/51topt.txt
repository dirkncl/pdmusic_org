1.
Oh! darkness now I'm go'ng to sing,
  De truth to you I'll tell;
Oh happy days dat I hab seen,
  Wid my dear Nancy Bell,
Oh! I wish dat I was back again,
  Way down in Tenisee,
Wid my dear Nancy by my side,
  Beneath the old pine tree.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
'Tis many a night since first we met,
  Beneath the old pine tree,
And dar we told our tales ob lub,
  How happy then were we.

2.
My lub has left me long ago,
  Whar she's no one can tell,
And I am nearly crazy now,
  For my dear Nancy Bell.
But I dreamt last night when all was still,
  Dat she'd come back to me,
And I would yet see happy days
  Beneath de old pine tree.

3.
I quite forgot I was so old,
  It seems to me a dream;
Dat three score years hab past and gone:
  Since I was seventeen.
But every thing is right at last,
  And Nancy's true to me;
And when we die oh let us rest:
  Beneath de old pine tree.
