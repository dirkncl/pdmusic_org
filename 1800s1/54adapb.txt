Description__ At a regular home-spun Virginia or Kentucky
Corn shucking, a Negro having the finest voice and the best
descriptive powers, and who is termed the Rhymer, is selected.
Mounting a stump or some other elevation he sings a couplet.
At the end of the couplet another singer especially appointed,
answers, "And dat's another puill back" The words "Holler boys
hoy" are then sung in Chorus. After a repetition of "And dat's
another pull back" and the Chorus "Holler boys hoy," the
principal singer, who is generally an _Improvisateur_ also,
sings "Hurrah for the Rhymer" The Chorus "Ho - o" follows, and
"Hurrah for the Rhymer" is again repeated. The verse ends with
the Chorus "Ha - ah," which the Negros sing in Unisons with a
nasal twang peculiar to themselves, and which is difficult to
imitate.

Ole Kurnel Sperry* from North Caroline
  Ranks among the Scholars:
He's the richest man in Buncombe town,
  And worth three thousand dollars.

[* The usual way of getting rid of a bore in Kentucky, is to
ask the question "Do you know Col: Sperry"?]

5.
Ole missus had a washing maid
  To wash up all the dishes,
And eb'ry time she comb'd her hair
  She ketch'd some little fishes.

6.
Ole Massa he's a mighty mean man,
  And eb'ry body knows it;
He keeps good "red-eye" in the house,
  But neber say__ here goes it.

7.
Once I know'd a yaller gal,
  Her name was Sally Russell,
She got a fall__ she tore her coat,
  And like to lost her bo-bo-bo-bonnet.
