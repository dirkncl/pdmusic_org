To Miss Angie A. Lyon 
"Little Maggie May" (1869)
Words by G. W. Moore
Music by Charles W. Blamphin
Arranged for the Guitar by Charles Harris

1.
The spring had come, the flow'rs in bloom,
The birds sung out their lay,
Down by a little running brook,
I first saw Maggie May;
She had a roguish jet black eye,
Was singing all the day.
And how I lov'd her none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

CHORUS
My little witching Maggie, Maggie,
singing all the day;
Oh! how I love her none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

2.
Though years roll'd on, yet still I lov'd
With heart so light and gay,
And never will this heart deceive
My own dear Maggie May;
When others thought that life was gone,
And death would take away.
Still by my side did linger one,
And that was Maggie May.

(CHORUS)

3.
May heav'n protect me for her sake,
I pray both night and day,
That I ere long may call her mine,
My own dear Maggie May,
For she is all the world to me
Altho' I'm far away;
I oft-times think of the running brook,
And my little Maggie May.

(CHORUS)
