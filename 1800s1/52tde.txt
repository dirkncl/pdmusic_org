1. Who will stand when I shall pillow 
  In the  earth this aching head, 
Pensive by the drooping willow 
  O’er my cold and lowly bed! 
There will be no tender mother, 
  Aged sire nor constant friend; 
There will be no sister, brother, 
  O’er my lonely grave to bend! 
  O’er my lonely grave to bend!

2. Strangers then will heedless bear me
  Where the stranger’s dust may lie;
Yet the tribute none will spare me,
  Of a tear, while thus I die.
They behold my lifestring sever
  At the conqueror’s final blow;
But the heart that’s breaking, never
  They its inward pangs shall know!
  They its inward pangs shall know!

3. Come, ye whisp’ring winds of heaven,
  Take my sighs,— my long adieu,—
To the country whence I’m driven,
  To the friends to whom I’m true!
Let them know I’ve ceased to languish;
  Tell them I am freed from pain;
That my bosom swelled with anguish,
  Till its cord all snapt in twain.
  Till its cord all snapt in twain.

4. Say my last regrets were centered,
  All my fondness lingered there,
Till a blissful home I entered,
  Free from banishment and care:
Say my glad unburdened spirit
  Soared in triumph at the last;
That a country I inherit
  Worth all sighs and sorrows past.
  Worth all sighs and sorrows past.

5. Faith and Hope, your strength is doubling!
  Soon the land will be possessed
“Where the wicked cease from troubling,
  And the weary are at rest.”
Death the mortal veil is rending,
  Lone, in foreign clods to lie;
Angels sweet the while descending,
  Come to waft me home on high!
  Come to waft me home on high!

1.
I have lov'd thee dearly lov'd thee,
  Through an age of worldly woe,
How ungrateful I have prov'd thee,
  Let me mournful exile show,
Ten long years of anxious sorrow
  Hour by hour I counted o'er,
Looking forward till tomorrow,
  Ev'ry day I lov'd thee more.
  Ev'ry day I lov'd thee more.

2.
Pow'r nor splendor could not charm me,
  I no joy in wealth could see,
Nor could threats or fears alarm me,
  Save the fear of losing thee!
When the storms of fortune press'd thee
  I have wept to see thee weep,
When relentless cares distress'd thee,
  I have lull'd those cares to sleep.
  I have lull'd those cares to sleep.
