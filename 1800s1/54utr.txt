1. Far away from wife and children,
Still I plod my way along,
Massa Clare has gone to Eva,
Leaving friendless poor old Tom.
Yet with trust and strength in heaven
I remain a faithful slave,
When de whip to me am giben,
I’ll think of him who died to save.

2. Shall I turn against my brother,
Raise the hand of cruelty?
No, we must love one another,
Den we’ll get where all am free.
Patience here I’ll go to glory,
There is comfort for the slave,
When de lash makes dis flesh gory,
I’ll pray to him who died to save.

3. Good bye Chloe, farewell children.
Poor old Tom, you’ll see no more.
Mind be good and hab religion.
’'Twill bare you to the faithful shore.
Do not weep nor shed tears ’bout me.
Suffering’s over in de grave,
But at de glorious resurrection,
We’ll meet him, who died to save.
