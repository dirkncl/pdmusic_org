1. The smiles, the tears, the hopes, the fears,
Of many a bygone hour;
Are freed from pain,
Yet live again,
By Music’s magic pow’r.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then give me song in the still midnight,
When the twinkling stars are shining bright,
And the palefaced moon,
With a holy light, peeps in at my lattice window.

2. The cot, the mill, the grove, the hill,
Where pass’d my sunny days;
With music’s strain,
Come back again,
To hold my ravished gaze.

3. The flow’ry nook, the singing brook,
Upon whose trippling tide,
My fairy boat,
Did proudly float
Once more are at my side.

4. If once again I ask that strain
I sure shall be forgiv’n,
For on its wing,
Comes each bright thing
That made my infan heav’n.
