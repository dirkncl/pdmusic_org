1. ’Twas too early, in her youth,
  That I saw her pass away,
And beheld the one I loved
  A lifeless form of clay.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O, the cruel hand of death,
  Caused my tears too soon to flow,
And this breaking heart will evermore
  The sad emotion know.

2. ’Twas too early in her youth,
  That she whispered soft to me,
And told me she must die,
  As I knelt upon my knee.

3. ’Tis too early, in her youth,—
  For the world has lost a gem,—
Too soo with trembling lip,
  To breathe her requiem.

4. ’Tis too early, in her youth,
  For flowers to bloom and fade
Around the grave of her,
  My darling Addelaide.
