1. Adieu my lovely Georgian Girl
  This night a last farewell.
My heart is full; it strives in vain
  For words its grief to tell.
Far, far away they hurry me,
  Ere morning dawns to start,
I must obey, ’tis death to stay
  Yet worse than death to part.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh weep no more my Gorgian Girl.
  He’ll soon return aagain.
Thy sadness shall be banished then
  And joy alone will reign.

2. Tho’ from thy sight thine only
  I’ll ever constant prove.
The Sun which lights thine eyes each morn
  Shall tell how true my love.
Of thee my thoughts by day shall be.
  Of thee my dreams by night.
Oh weep no more— we’ll meet again.
  Dark days will change to bright.

3. Times past away, the Gorgian girl
  Hop’d on, alas in vain:
Her wasting form told plainly that
  They ne’er would meet again.
Now in the silent grave she’s laid
  Whilst far away still true
Her lover broken hearted sings
  For her, this last adieu.
