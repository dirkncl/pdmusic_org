Come into the garden, Maud,
  For the black bat, Night, is flown;
Come into the garden, Maud,
  I am here at the gate alone.

And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,
  And the musk of the roses bloom,
For a breeze of morning moves,
  And the planet of love is on high,
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves,
  On a bed of daffodil sky,
To faint in the light of the sun she loves,
  To faint in the light and to die.

Come! come! Come into the garden, Maud,
  For the black bat, Night, is flown;
Come into the garden, Maude,
  I am here at the gate alone.

Queen Rose of the rosebud, Garden of girls,
  Come hither, the dances are done;
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,
  Queen lily and rose, in one.
Shine out little head sunning over the curls
  To the flowers and be their Sun.
Shine out! Shine out! and be their Sun.

Come! come! Come into the garden, Maud,
  For the black bat, Night, is flown;
Come into the garden, Maude.

She is coming, my own, my sweet,
  Were it ever so airy a tread,
My heart would hear her and beat,
  Were it earth in an earthy bed,
Come my own, my sweet,
Come my own, my sweet,
  Maud, Maud, come, I'm here at the gate alone.
