1.
Will you come with me my Phillis, dear to yon blue mountain free,
  Where the blossoms smell the sweetest, come rove along with me.
It's every Sunday morning when I am by your side,
  We'll jump into the Wagon, and all take a ride.

[REFRAIN]
Wait for the Wagon, Wait for the Wagon,
Wait for the Wagon and we'll all take a ride.

CHORUS
Wait for the Wagon, Wait for the Wagon,
Wait for the Wagon and we'll all take a ride.

2.
Where the river runs like silver, and the birds they sing so sweet,
  I have a cabin, Phyllis, and something good to eat.
Come listen to my story, it will relieve your heart,
  So jump into the Wagon, and off we will start.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
Do you believe my Phyllis, dear, old Mike with all his wealth,
  Can make you half so happy, as I with youth and health?
We'll have a little farm, a horse, a pig and cow;
  And you will mind the dairy, while I will guide the plow.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
Your lips are red as poppies, your hair so slick and neat,
  All braided up with dahlias, and hollyhocks so sweet.
It's ev'ry Sunday morning, when I am by your side,
  We'll jump into the Wagom, and all take a ride.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

5.
Together on life's journey, we'll travel till we stop,
  And if we have no trouble, we'll reach the happy top.
Then come with me sweet Phyllis, my dear, my lovely bride,
  We'll jump into the Wagon, and all take a ride.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
