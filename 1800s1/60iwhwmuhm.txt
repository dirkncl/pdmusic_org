1. I wish he would make up his mind, ma,
For I don’t care much longer to wait;
I’m sure I have hinted quite strongly,
That I thought about changing my state;
For a sweetheart he’s really so backward,
I can’t bring him out if I try;
I own that he’s very good temper’d,
But then he’s so dreadfully shy;
  I own that he’s very good temper’d,
  But then he’s sp dreadfully shy!

2. When I speak about love and a cottage,
He gives me a glance of surprise;
And if I but hint about marriage,
He blushes quite up to his eyes;
I can’t make him jealous, I’ve tried it,
And ’tis no use my being unkind;
For that’s not the way I am certain
To get him to make up his mind;
  For that’s not the way I am certain
  To get him to make up his mind!

3. I’ve sung him love sonnets by dozens,
I’ve work’d him both slippers and hose,
And we’ve walk’d out by moonlight together,
Yet he never attempts to propose;
You really must ask his intentions,
Or some other beau I must find;
For indeed I won’t tarry much longer
For one who can’t make up his mind;
  For indeed I won’t tarry much longer
  For one who can’t make up his mind!
