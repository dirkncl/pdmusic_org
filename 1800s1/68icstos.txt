1.
I cannot sing the old songs, 
I sung long years ago.
For heart and voice would fill mem
And foolish tears would flow;
For bygone hours come o'er my heart,
With each familiar strain.
I cannot sing the old songs,
Or dream those dreams again.
  I cannot sing the old songs,
  Or dream those dreams again.

2.
I cannot sing the old songs,
Their charm is sad and deep,
Their melodies would waken,
Old sorrows from their sleep
And tho' all unforgatten still,
And sadly sweet they be,
I cannot sing the old songs,
They are too dear to me.
  I cannot sing the old songs,
  They are too dear to me.

3.
I cannot sing the old songs,
For visions come again,
Of golden dreams departed,
And years of weary pain,
Perhaps when earthly fetters shall
Have set my spirit free,
My voice may know the old songs,
For all eternity.
  My voice may know the old songs,
  For all eternity.
