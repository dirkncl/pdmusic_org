1.
'Twas whispered one morning in Heaven,
How the little white angel May,
Sat ever beside the portal,
Sorrowing all the day,
How she said to the stately warden,
He of the golden bar---
"O, angel, sweet angel I pray thee,
Let the beautiful gates ajar;
Only a little I pray you,
Let the heavenly gates ajar."

CHORUS
"O, angel, sweet angel, I pray you
Let the beautiful gates ajar,
Only a little I pray you,
Let the beautiful gates ajar.

2.
"I hear my dear mother there weeping,
She is lonely, she cannot see,
A glimmer of light in the darkness,
Where the gates clos'd after me;
One gleam of the golden splendor,
O, warden would shine so far,"
But the angel he whispered "I dare not
Let the beautiful gates ajar;"
Spoke low as he answered "I dare not,
Let the heavenly gates ajar."

(CHORUS)

3.
Then up arose Mary the Bles-sed,
Sweet Mary, the mother of Christ,
Her hand on the hand of the angel,
She laid, and her touch sufficed,
Then turned was the key in the portal,
Fell ringing the golden bar,
And lo! in the child's fingers,
Stood the beautiful gates ajar;
And lo! in the child's angel fingers,
Stood the beautiful gates ajar.

(CHORUS)

4.
"And this key for no further using,
To my bles-sed Son shall be giv'n,"
Said Mary the mother of Jesus,
Tenderest heart in Heav'n,
Now never a sad eyed mother,
But may catch the glory afar,
Since safe in the Lord Christ's bosom,
Are the keys of the gates ajar;
Safe hid in the dear Christ's bosom,
And the gates forever ajar.

(CHORUS)
