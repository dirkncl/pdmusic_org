1.
Ye Democrats list to my story,
Ye Douglaslies all give me heed;
Though your Candidate's running for glory,
He's not making very good speed.
But out on the wide rolling prairie
A tall Sucker is taken the course,
Who will wind up the race in a hurry
And distance your Stubby-tailed horse.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then hurrah! (hip, hip,) hurrah! (hip, hip,) hurrah!
Then hurrah! for honest old Abe, boys,
For honest old Abe of the West;
He will wind up the race in a hurry,
And distance their bravest and best.

2.
Your Tennessee Stallion aint game, boys,
Your Colt of Kentucky aint sound,
And you'll find in the end that you're lame, boys,
For old Buck will be cheating all round.
But the people will always remember
The Pioneer Sucker with care,
And after the ides of November
Will give him the President's chair.

3.
Our foe is divided and rent, boys,--
They're going to ruin quite fast,
Let them down on their knees and repent, boys,
And "own up" the "nigger" at last.
Then we'll up with our banners and shout, boys,
And the principle boldly contest,
And the foe we will gallantly rout, boys,
With Honest Old Abe of the West.
