1. Heard  ye, the news, how the war is o’er,
And peace proclaimed from shore to shore?
Heard ye the martial strains resound
With the measured tread of homeward bound?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then welcome the soldier home, 
 the sailor, and soldier home,
Let the bells ring out, let the people shout, 
 for the brave are welcome home.

2. Heard ye, the old flag floats once more,
In regal beauty as of yore,
On the walls of Sumpter it waves on high,
Its tattered fold ’gainst the azure sky?

3. Twine ye the laurel, the laurel green,
And wreath the brow of noble mien,
Enroll their names and the deeds they’ve done,
While freedom smiles on the vict’rey won.

[Girl I left behind me]
4. O saw ye, the throng of the fair and the brave,
As they met, how it did remind me,
Of parting’s fond, and the music’s wave,
The girl I left behind me.

5. O saw ye, the heroes of Richmond, home,
With the meteors of Sherman prancing,
And Sheridan brave, on his coal black roan,
’Mong the war steeds proudly dancing.
