1. Here’s hot corn, nice hot corn, a voice was crying! 
Sweet hot corn, sweet hot corn, the breeze is sighing! 
Come, buy, come bye, the world’s unfeeling— 
How can she sell while sleep is stealing?

CHORUS 1
Hot corn, Hot corn! do buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! do buy my nice hot corn.

2. All alone, all alone, she sat there weeping;
While at home, while at home, her sister’s sleeping.
Come buy, come buy, I’m tired of staying;
Come buy, come buy, I’m tired of saying

CHORUS 2
Hot corn, Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn.

3. Often there, often there, she sat so drear’ly
With one thought, for she lov’d her sister dearly,
Didst hate? didst hate? how could she ever?
How could she hate her mother? never!

CHORUS 3
Hot corn, Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn.

4. Often there, often there, while others playing,
Hear the cry, buy my corn, she’s ever praying,
Pray buy, pray buy, kind hearted stranger,
One ear, then home, I’ll brave the danger.

CHORUS 4
Hot corn, Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! come buy my nice hot corn.

5. Now at home, now at home, her crying is changing!
Will he come? will he come? while fever’s raging
She cries, she cries, pray let me see him.
Once more, once more, pray let me see him.

CHORUS 5
Hot corn, Hot corn! he’ll. buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! he’ll buy my nice hot corn.

6. Will he come? will he come? she’s constant crying,
Will he come? will he come? poor Katy’s dying,
’Twas he! ’twas he! kind words was speaking
Hot corn, hot corn, while I was seeking

CHORUS 6
Hot corn, Hot corn! who’ll buy my nice hot corn? 
Hot corn! Hot corn! who’ll buy my nice hot corn?

7. Midnight there, midnight there, my hot corn crying,
Kindly spoke, first kind words, they stopt my sighing.
That night, that night, when sleep was stealing,
Kind words, kind words, my heart was healing.

CHORUS 7
Hot corn, Hot corn! he’ll. buy my nice hot corn, 
Hot corn! Hot corn! he’ll buy my nice hot corn.

8. Will he come? will he come?— weak hands are feeling!
He has come; he has come!— I see him kneeling—
One kiss— the light— how dim ’tis growing—
I thank— ’tis dark— good bye— I’m going—

CHORUS 8
Hot corn— Hot corn— no more shall cry— hot corn!!! 
Hot corn— Hot corn— no more shall cry— hot corn!!!

9. Drop a tear, drop a tear, for she’s departed,
Drop a tear, drop a tear, poor broken hearted;
A pledge— a pledge— the world is crying,
Take warning— warning— by Katy’s dying.

CHORUS 9
Hot corn, Hot corn! who’ll buy my nice hot corn? 
Hot corn! Hot corn! who’ll buy my nice hot corn?
