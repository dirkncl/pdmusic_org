Poetry and Music by John P. Ordway

1.
Twinkling stars are laughing love,
  Laughing on you and me;
While your bright eyes look in mine,
  Peeping stars they seem to be.
Troubles come and go, love,
  Brightest scenes must leave our sight;
But the star of hope, love,
  Shines with radiant beams tonight.

CHORUS
Twinkling stars are laughing love,
  Laughing on you and me;
While your bright eyes look in mine,
  Peeping stars they seem to be.

2.
Golden beams are shining, love,
  Shining on you to bless;
Like the queen of night you fill
  Darkest space with loveliness.
Silver stars how bright, love,
  Mother moon in thronely might,
Gaze on us to bless, love,
  Purest vows here made to night.

(CHORUS)
