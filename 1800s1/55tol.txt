1. There is no one left to love me,
I’m alone all alone,
Here no kind word is spoken
To the orphan one.
Sad and cheerless, lone and dreary
Waves my youthful life away,
Would that I my head so weary
On my Mother’s breast could lay.

2. But she’s gone where sorrow never,
Sends its with’ring shift
For the tree of life for ever,
Blossoms on her path.
Heaven grant the Orphan lonely
May some day her spirit meet
To that world so blest and holy
Guide, oh guide my erring feet.
