1. Roll out the grand old banner, whose folds unite the free,
They wave o’er ANDREW JOHNSON, the star of Tennessee.
Oh! twine a wreath of olive where laurel boughs were bent,
And raise the shout together, God bless the President—

[CHORUS 1-5]
Roll out the grand old banner,
Whose folds unite the free,
They wave o’er ANDREW JOHNSON.
The star of Tennessee.

2. He hush’d the dying murmur, that whisper’d o’er the land,
He chid his erring brother— he grasp’d him by the land;
Away, ye canting bigouts— probe not the healing sore,
Let ancient pride unite us— let racor rage no more.

3. For through the sky there gkimmers, a rainbow o’er the night,
To dry Columbia’s weeping— to hail her future bright.
Cheer up ye crippled heroes— death clouds have died away;
There beats a heart to aid you— not made of selfish clay.

4. Now joy gild every mountain, and peace smile o’er each plain,
And happiness light ev’ry cot, from Florida to Maine,
Let maiden’s songs reecho, where foemen met the foe,
And childhood’s laughter waken, the homes of long ago.

5. You tatter’d Northern banners, their tales of glory tell,
O’erhangs the weeping willow, where Southern valor fell;
Bare then your arms together, look proudly o’er the sea,
And throw the gage for liberty, ye grandson’s of the free.
