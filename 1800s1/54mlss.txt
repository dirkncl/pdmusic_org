1.
  When I was young, not long ago
In Maryland I did dwell;
  ’Twas there I lov’d a yellow girl—
Oh! wasn’t she a belle;
  Her form was round, not very tall,
And curly was her hair;
  The darkies said my Susy,
Was the fairest of the fair.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then if you see my Susy dear,
Speak kindly to her all,
Oh! tell her the last words that I spoke were,
My poor Susy Saul.

2.
  I took my love to a ball one night,
’Twas early in the fall,
  And ’fore three weeks had pass’d away,
I married Susy Saul;
  In a cot we lived together,
Down by the river side,
  How happy was the darky then,
With my lovely yellow bride. bride. bride. 

3.
  While working in the field one day,
Near the tree that grows so tall,
  Old massa said he was going to sell,
My lovely Susy Saul;
  In vain I pleaded for my wife,
That we might never part,
  But cruelly he said: “no, no!”
It almost broke my heart.

4.
  I’ve nothing left to live for now,
My wife I’ll see no more,
  For she will ne’er return again,
To old Virginia shore;
  And when I’m dead and buried,
Beneath the old stone wall,
  Upon a slab these words you’ll see;
“He died for Susy Saul.”
