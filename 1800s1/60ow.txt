A very aged mand in the Almshouse was
asked "WHAT HE WAS DOING NOW?" He
repled "ONLY WAITING."

1. Only waiting ’till the shadows 
  Are a little longer grown, 
Only waiting ’till the glimmer 
  Of the day’s last beam is flown. 
’Till the light of earth is faded, 
  From the heart onve full of day, 
’Till the stars of Heav’n are breaking 
  Through the twilight soft and grey. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Only waiting ’till the shadows 
  Are a little longer grown, 
Only waiting, 
Only waiting.

2. Only waiting ’till the reapers 
Have the last sheaf gathered home, 
For the summer time is faded, 
And the autumn winds have come. 
Quicly reapers gather quickly, 
The last ripe hours of my heart, 
For the bloom of life is withered, 
And I hasten to depart. 

3. Only waiting, ’till the angels
  Open wide the mystic gate,
At whose feet I have lingered long,
  Weary, poor and desolate.
Even now I hear their footsteps,
  And their voices far away,
If they call me; I am waiting,
  Only waiting to obey.

4. Only waiting, ’till the shadows
  Are a little longer grown,
Only waiting, ’till the glimmer
  Of the day’s last beam is flown.
When from out the gath’ring darkness
  Holy deathless stars shall rise,
By whose light my soul shall gladly
  Tread its pathway to the skies.
