1. De Fader ob de waters, rolls
His deep and muddy tide,
By de grassy grave where Eva sleeps,
De people say she died;
“Truth crush’d to the earth will rise again,”
So Massa Bryant said,
And Eva’s only sleeping,
Tho’ de people say she’s dead.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Knock! Knock! Knock!
When de hour ob midnight come—
Oh who is dat a knocking?
Tis the Ghost of “Uncle Tom.

2. Oh! de nigger’s only made to work,
De sudden people say;
And de nigger’s berry willing, but
He wants to hab his pay;
So he swims across de ribber,
And he flies across de plain;
But de northern people cath him,
And dey ribbit on his chains!

3. Oh! one ob dese times
Dere will come a solemn day,
When de sheep will go together,
And de goats together stay;
Der’l be many brack sheep,
And many white goats,
So dey better “pluck de Beams out
Before dey pluck de motes.
