1. No I never mean to marry,
Beaux shall sigh for me in vain;
I will flirt with Frank or Harry
Free from Hymen’s galling chain,
  Free from care,
  Free from air,
I will roam ’mid pleasures rare.
  Gaily sing,
  Reveling,
In freedom like the birds of spring.

2. But when old, should friends neglect me,
Though now courted and obey’d;
Who will cherish and protect me?
All would shun the “poor old maid.”
  Picture sad,
  ’Tis too bad,
Quite enough to drive one mad—
  Oh, Heigh— ho!
  Oh, Heigh— ho!
What shall I answer? Yes, or No?

3. Still unyielding— still disdaining—
All my pow’rs I practice well,
Making conquests— proudly reigning
Queen of May, and Village Bell.
  I’ll not sigh,
  Faint, nor cry
For a lover, no, not I—
  He may go,
  Tell him so,
My answer is decided— No.

4. Wait a moment— ’tis dear Harry—
I will go myself and tell—
Though I never mean to marry,
Still I ought to treat him well.
  There, Oh there!
  I declare!
Though he popp’d the question, fair,
  None can guess,
  My distress,
When through mistake, I answer’d— Yes.
