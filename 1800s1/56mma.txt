1. 
Fare you well, my own Mary Ann.
Fare you well for a while.
For the Ship it is ready and the wind it is fair,
And I am bound for the Sea, Mary Ann,
and I am bound for the Sea, Mary Ann.

2. 
Don’t you see that turtle dove,
A sitting on yonder pile!
Lamenting the loss of its one true love,
And so am I for mine, Mary Ann,
and so am I for mine, Marry Ann.

3. 
A lobster in a lobster pot,
A blue fish riggling on a hook,
May suffer some, but oh! no not,
What I do feel for my Mary Ann,
what I do feel for my Mary Ann.

4. 
The pride of all the produce rare,
That is our kitchen garden grow’d,
Was punkins, but none could compare
In angel form to my Mary Ann,
in angel form to my Mary Ann.
