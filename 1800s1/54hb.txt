1.
Hurrah my lads the lively breeze now bloweth fresh and free,
And through the rattling cordage all it pipes right merrily
It pipes right merrily right merrily right merrily.
Up with the heavy anchor then and let the air resound
And let the air resound with a merry song and chorus lads
for we are homeward bound with a merry song and chorus lads
for we are homeward bound
we're homeeard bound
we'er homeward bound
for we are homeward bound
for we are homeward bound.

2.
Swift out upon the heaving waves our stout ship now shall ride,
Triumphant o'er each billows crest upon the ocean wide
Upon the ocean wide ocean wide ocean wide.
About her prow the blue waves curl and lift their heads of foam
And lift their heads of foam
the lively breeze still follows on hurrah we're homeward bound
the lively breeze still follows on hurrah we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound
hurrah we're homeward bound
hurrah we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound.

3.
Far, far behind the distant shore has faded from the view,
As forth upon our homeward course we plough the billows blue
We plough the billows blue billows blue billows blue.
So spread the canvas to the breeze and let the air resound
And let the air resound
with a merry song and chorus lads hurrah we're homeward bound
with a merry song and chorus lads hurrah we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound
hurrah we're homeward bound
hurrah we're homeward bound
we're homeward bound.
