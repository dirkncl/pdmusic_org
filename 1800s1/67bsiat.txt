1. Bonnie Scotland! I adore thee;
Now I wander gladly o’er thee
They enchantments will restore me—
Bonie, bonnie Scotland!
Mid the rays of summer weather;
Sweetly blooms thy mountain heather;
Love and beauty sport together;

[REFRAIN]
Bonnie bonnie Scotland
Oh Bonnie Scotland! I adore thee,
Now I wander gladly o’er thee
Thy enchantments will restore me—
Bonnie bonnie Scotland!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Bonnie Scotland! I adore thee;
Now I wander gladly o’er thee
Thy enchantments will restore me—
Bonnie bonnie Scotland!

2. Bonnie Scotland! land of granduer!
Where the sparkling streams meander
Here will I delight to wander,
Bonnie bonnie Scotland!
Thou art dearest to me ever
From my bosom banish’d never
Ne’er again we hope to sever
