1. Our poets may sing of the lives that fling 
Their light o’er a world subtime, 
And sages may tell of the names that dwell 
Like stars o’er the clouds of time; 
But among the deeds that are sung or told, 
In the legends of now or then, 
There are none more bright, there are none more bold, 
Than the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Marion’s men, Marion’s men, 
There are none more bright, there are none more bold, 
Than the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Marion’s men, Marion’s men, Marion’s

2. In the gloomiest strife of our country’s life, 
When her dawning was darkened by night; 
When tyrants were found on her holiest ground, 
And her friends  were scattered in flight; 
When the best of her children unarmed and unfed, 
Were hunted thro’ cavern and glen, 
The red ranks of Albion trembled with dread 
At the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Than the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Marion’s men, Marion’s men, 
The red ranks of Alblon trembled with dread, 
At the deeds of Marion’s men.

3. The emblems we raise to acknowledge their praise 
Will not crumble in tempest or wave; 
Their monuments stand, thro’ the length of the land, 
In the hearts of the noble and brave; 
For their mem’ry will shine and their glory will last, 
Giving light to the days that have been;  
And long shall our freemen be proud of the past, 
And the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Than the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Marion’s men, Marion’s men, 
And long shall our freemen be proud of the past, 
And the deeds of Marion’s men.

4. Whenever a gun in the glad morning sun; 
When the stars of our banner unfurled, 
Proclaim the great day whose beautiful ray 
Gave freedom’s first hope to the world; 
When the shouts for our heroes, like deep thunders roll 
From the ocean to mountain top then 
Rememmber the grandeur of Marion’s soul, 
And the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Than the deeds of Marion’s men. 
Marion’s men, Marion’s men, 
Remember the grandeur of Marrion’s soul 
And the deeds of Marion’s men.
