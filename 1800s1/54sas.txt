1. While going up Fifth Avenue one fine evening in May,
A guan to bid fare well to one, not long to star away;
Not long to stay away indeed from my dear little Dine,
For she am tender to me, and I’m de old bullguine.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! Susy Anna Simson,
Susy Anna Simson come by’ne bye,
Soon be afloat on the old steamboat,
Susy Anna Simson don’t you cry.

2. We then went o’er to Hoboken, we passed the Sybil cave,
She said if I would leave her, soon she’d jump into the wave;
She’d jump into the wave, she would— she then began to cry,
I raised my coat sleeve to her nose, and then I wiped her eye.

3. Says she, my dearest Johnathon, that handsome head of curls,
You’ll lose them one by one, you will, when romping with the girls,
They’ll shave that sheep’s head, yes they will, and then you will get malled,
If ever you come back to me with that old head black balled.

4. I’ll come back from the Diggens dear, with lots of golden sand,
Then you and I’ll be joined in one, in padlock’s holy band;
Withing some years from now, my love, oh! what a joyous tone;
We’ll have a little minstrel band that we can call our own.
