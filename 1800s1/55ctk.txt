1. Yeomen strong, hither throng, 
  Nature’s honest men: 
We will make the wilderness, 
  Bud and bloom again; 
Bring the sickle, speed the plough, 
  Turn the ready soil; 
Freedom is the noblest pay, 
  For the true man’s toil.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ho! brothers! 
Come, brothers! 
Hasten all with me, 
We’ll sing upon the Kansas plains 
A song of Liberty. 
Ho! brothers! 
Come, brothers! 
Hasten all with me, 
We’ll sing upon the Kansas plains, 
A song of Liberty. 
We’ll sing upon the Kansas plains, 
A song of Liberty.

2. Father, haste! o’er the waste 
  Lies a pleasant land: 
There your fireside altar stones, 
  Fixed in truth shall stand. 
There your sons, brave and good, 
  Shall to freemen grow, 
Clad in triple mail of right, 
  Wrong to overthrow.

3. Mother, come, here’s a home,
  In the waiting west:
Bring the seed of love and peace
  You who sow them best:
Faithful hearts— holy prayers
  Keep from taint the air;
Soil a mother’s tears have wet,
  Golden crops shall bear.

4. Brother brave, stem the wave!
  From the prairies tread!
Up the dark Missouri flood
  Be your canvas spread.
Sister true, join us too,
  Where the Kansas flows;
Let the Northern lily bloom
With the Southern rose.

5. One and all, hear our call
  Echo through the land!
Aid us with the willing heart
  And the strong right hand!
Feed the spark the Pilgrims struck
  On old Plymouth Rock!
To the watchfires of the free
  Millions glad shall flock.
