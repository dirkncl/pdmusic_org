[Solo.  First Fairy.]
Right joyous sprites and blythe be we
Who gaily live and daintily,
Right joyous sprites and blythe be we,
Who gaily live and daintily;
For our home in the green old mountain vale,
Afar from the city’s moanful wail;
And the task the Master given us there,
Is to render all things glad and fair,
And the task Master gives us there,
Is to render all things glad and fair,
For our home is the green old mountain vale,
Afar from the city’s moanful wail;
And the task the Master gives us there,
Is to render all things glad and fair,
And the task the Master gives us there,
Is to render all things glad and fair.

[Solo. Second Fairy.]
And glad alway is our dainty life,
With a myriad rarest pleasures rife.
For our music we list to rill or bird,
Or laughter from gypsying childhood heard,
For our music we list to rill or bird,
Or laughter from gypsying And glad alway is our dainty life,
With a myriad rarest pleasures rife.
For our music we list to rill or bird,
Or laughter from gypsying childhood heard,
For our music we list to rill or bird,
Or laughter from gypsying childhood heard,
For our music we list to rill or bird,
Or laughter from gypsying childhood heard,
Or laughter from gypsying childhood heard;
Or a softer voice may thrill the grove,
Or a softer voice may thrill the grove,
For our fairy hall is the bower of love;
For our fairy hall is the bower of love,
is the bower of love, is the bower of love,
is the bower of love, is the bower of love.

[Duet. Third & Fourth Fairy.]
Thus we live till the rainbow tints we’ve laid
On summer leaves begin to fade.
While far, far along the western skies,
Day, like the changeful dolphin dies,
We steal the tints of the gorgeous eves,
We steal the tints of the gorgeous eves,
To Thus we live till the rainbow tints we’ve laid
On summer leaves begin to fade.
While far, far along the western skies,
Day, like the changeful dolphin dies,
We steal the tints the gorgeous eves,
We steal the tints the gorgeous eves,
To hide the blight on the forest leaves,
To hide the blight on the forest leaves,
the blight on the forest leaves,
the blight on the forest leaves;

And the Autumn hill sides glow anew
With a splender summer, summer never knew,
That summer never knew,

[Full Chorus. (overlapping voices)]
  Aye, Aye,
[First Semi-Chorus.]
That summer never knew,
[Second Semi-Chorus.]
That summer never knew,
[First Semi-Chorus.]
That summer never knew,

That summer never knew,
[Full Chorus. (overlapping voices)]
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye.

[Full Chorus of Fairies]
And a dainty life we live alway,
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray,
And a dainty life we live alway,
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray,
And a dainty life,
And a dainty life,
And a dainty life, we live alway,
In the darkling wood,
In the darkling wood,
In the darkling wood and sparkling ray,
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray,
And a dainty life we live alway
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray,
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray,
In the darkling wood and the sparkling ray.
And a dainty life we live alway.

[First Semi-Chorus.]
We crimson the maple, we guild the beach;
Each leaf some strange, bright hue we teach.

[Second Semi-Chorus.]
The valley had never a fairer scene,
The streamlet had never a brighter sheen.

[First Semi-Chorus.]
But fairest splendor must fade and die;

[Second Semi-Chorus.]
Then summon our chariot birds and fly;

[First Semi-Chorus.]
The summer is past;
[Second Semi-Chorus.]
  the storms will come;
[Both Semi-Choruses.]
Then hie away from our fairy home;
The summer is past, the storms will come,
Then hie aaway from our fairy home;
The summer is past, the storms will come;
Then hie away from our fairy home,
from our fairy
[Full Chorus. (overlapping voices)]
  Farewell, Farewell, Farewell, Farewell.
[Both Semi-Choruses.]
home, from our fairy home, from our fairy home,
from our fairy home; farewell,

[Full Chorus.]
Farewell to the bowers where we lay,
In the laughing, leafy summer day;
Farewell to the bowers where we lay,
In the laughing leafy summer day,
In the laughing leafy summer day;
Farewell to the bowers
Farewell, Farewell.
