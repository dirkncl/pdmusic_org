1. What is home without a father,
When our daily race is run,
And around the hearth we gather!
’Tis a world without the sun!
Is there real wealth in treasure;
Though its richest gifts we share?
Is there real joy in pleasure,
If his light be wanting there!
Ah! no:

[CHORUS 1]
For a home without a father,
When our daily race is run;
And around the hearth we gather,
Is a world without the sun.

2. What is home without a father,
In the dark and cloudy day!
Is it home? or is it rather
But the guesthouse where we stay?
Oh! his kindly voice can cheer us
In affliction’s saddest hour;
And to feel that he is near us
Robs distress of half its power.
Ah! yes:

[CHORUS 2]
But a home without a father,
In the dark and cloudy day;—
Is it home? or is it rather
But the guesthouse where we stay?
