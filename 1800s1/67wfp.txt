1.
Three little forms in the twilight gray.
Scanning the shadows across the way.
Six little eyes: four black, two blue:
Brimful of love and happiness too:

CHORUS
Watching for Pa, watching for Pa,
Yes, watching, yes, watching, for Pa.
Watching for Pa, watching for Pa,
Yes, watching, yes, watching, for Pa.

2.
O how the gaze at the passers by:
He's coming at last they gally cry:
"Try again, pets," exclaims Mama,
And Nellie says that's twilight star.

CHORUS
Watching for Pa, watching for Pa,
Yes, watching, yes, watching, for Pa.
Watching for Pa, watching for Pa,
Yes, watching, yes, watching, for Pa.

3.
Soon joyous shouts from the window seat,
And eager patter of childish feet,
Gay musical chimes ring thro' the hall,
A manly voice responds to the call--

CHORUS
Welcome, Papa, welcome, Papa,
Yes, welcome, yes, welcome, Papa!
Welcome, Papa, welcome, Papa,
Yes, welcome, yes, welcome, Papa!
