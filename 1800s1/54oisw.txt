1.
Oh! white-folks, I was never born,--
Aunt Sue raise me on de corn,
Send me errands night and morn,
Ching a ring a ring a ricked.
She used to knock on de floor,
Den hang my head agin de door,
And tare my hair out by de core,
Oh! I was so wicked.

Black folks can't do naught, they say,
I guess I'll teach some how to play,
And dance about dis time ob day,--
Ching a ring a bang goes de breakdown.

2.
Oh! Massa Clare, he bring me here,
Put me in Miss Freeley's care,
Don't I make dat lady stare,--
Ching a ring a ring a ricked.
She has me taken cloth'd and fed,
Den sends me up to make her bed,
When I de foot into de head,
Oh! I'se so awful wicked.

I'se dar Topsy as you see:
None of your half and half for me,
Black or white its best to be,
Ching a ring a bop, goes the breakdown.

3.
Oh! dere is one will come and day,--
"Be good, Topsy, learn to pray!"
And raise her bufull hands dat way,
Ching a ring a ring a ricked.
'Tis Little Eva, kind and fair,
Says if I'se good I will go dere,
But den I tells her I don't care,
Oh! aint I very wicked.

Eat de cake and love de corn,
I'se de gal dat ne'er was born,
But 'spects I grow'd up one dark morn,
Ching a ring a smash goes de breakdown.
