1.
Welcome, Christmas! Welcome here,
Happiest season of the year.
Fires are blazing thee to greet,
Families together meet.
Brothers, Sisters, circle round,
Joyously each greeting sound,
And the church delights to see,
All her children welcome Thee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[SOPRANO & TENOR]
Welcome Christmas!
[SOPRANO & ALTO]
Welcome here!
[SATB]
Happiest season of the year!
Happiest season of the year!

2.
Welcome, Christmas! for thy voice;
Calls upon us to rejoice;
Now with foolish idle mirth,
Born and perishing on earth;
Far be the ungrateful thought!
Ours are blessings dearly bought;
Dearly bought, but freely given,
By the Lord of earth and heaven.

3.
Fix we then on Christ our eye;
May we feel the Saviour nigh!
May we meet around the board,
All rejoicing in the Lord!
Be the babe of Bethlehem near;
May His smile the season cheer;
And each gladdened heart and tongue,
Join the Angel's Christmas Song.
