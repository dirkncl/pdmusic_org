1. Always look on the sunny side, 
And though life chequer’d by; 
A gladsome heart bids care depart, 
And time fly pleasantly. 
Why sit and mourn o’er fancied ills, 
When danger is not near; 
Care is a self consuming thing, 
That hardest nerves can wear.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Always show on the sunny side, 
And though life chequered be, 
A gladsome heart bids care depart, 
And time flies pleasantly.

2. Always look on the sunny side, 
And though you do not find, 
All things according to your wish, 
Be not disturbed in mind. 
The greatest evils that can come, 
Are lighter far to bear; 
When met by fortitude and strength, 
Instead of doubt and fear.

3. Always look on the sunny side, 
There’s health in harmless jest;
And much to soothe our worldly cares,
In hoping for the best.
The gloomy path is far too dark,
For happy feet to tread;
And tells of pain and solitude,
Of friends estranged and dead.

4. Always look on the sunny side, 
And never yield a doubt;
The ways of Providence are wise,
And faith will bear you out.
If you but make this maxim yours,
And in its strength abide;
Believing all is for the best,
Look on the sunny side.
