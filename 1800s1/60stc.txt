1. Old Simon the Cellarer, keeps a rare store
Of Malmsry and Malroisie
And Cyprus, and who can say how many more!
For a chary old soul is he.
A chary old soul is he.
O! Sick and Canary he never doth fail,
And all the year round there is brewing of ale;
Yet he never aileth, he quaintly doth say,
While he keeps to his sober six flagons a day;
But ho! ho! ho! his nose doeth shew,
How oft the black Jack to his lips doth go.
But ho! ho! ho! his nose dow shew,
How oft the black Jack to his lips doth go.

2. Dame Margery sits in her own still room,
And a Matron sage is she;
From thence oft at Curfen is wafted a fume,
She says, "it is Rosemaries;"
She says, "it is Rosemaries;"
But there's a small cupboard behind the back stair,
And the maids say they often see Margery there.
Now Margery says that she "grows very old,
And she must take a something to keep out the cold."
But ho! ho! ho! old Simon doth know,
Where many a flask of his best doth go,
But ho! ho! ho! old Simon doth know,
Where many a flack of his best doth go.

3. Old Simon reclines in his highback'd chair,
And oft talks about taking a vile;
And Margery is often heard to declare:
"She ought to be settled in life!"
"She ought to be settled in life!"
But But Margery has (so the maids say) a tongue,
And she's not very handsome, and not very young;
So somehow it ends with a shake of the head,
And old Simon he brews him a tankard instead;
While ho! ho! ho! he will chuckly and crow,
What! mary old Margery? no! no! no!
While ho! ho! ho! he will chuckly and crow,
What! mary old Margery? no! no! no!

N.B. The words marked in quotation are sung
by Mr. Drayton in falsetto.
