1.
Oh, they tell me thou art dead, Katy Darling,
  That thy smile I may never more behold!
Did they tell thee I was false, Katy Darling,
  Or my love for thee had e'er grown cold?
Oh they know not the loving
  Of the hearts of Erin's sons;
When a love like thee to thine Katy Darling,
  Is the goal to the race that he runs,
  Oh, hear me, sweet Katy,

CHORUS 1
For the wild flowers greet me, Katy Darling,
  And the love-birds are singing on each tree;
Wilt thou never more hear me, Katy Darling;
  Behold, love, I'm waiting for thee.

2.
I'm kneeling by thy grave, Katy Darling;
  This world is all a blank world to me!
Oh, could'st thou hear my wailing, Katy Darling,
  Or think love I am sighing for thee;
Oh, methinks the stars are weeping,
  By their soft and lambent light;
And thy heart would be melting, Katy Darling.
  Could'st thou see thy lone Dermot this night.
  Oh listen, sweet Katy!

CHORUS 2
For the wild flowers are sleeping, Katy Darling,
  And the love birds are nest'ling in each tree;
Wilt thou never more hear me, Katy Darling,
  Or know, love, I'm kneeling by thee!

3.
Iis useless all my weeping, Katy Darling!
  But I'll pray that thy spirit be my guide;
And that when my life is spent, Katy Darling,
  They will lay me down to rest by thy side.
Oh a hugh great grief I'm bearing,
  Though I scarce can heave a sigh;
And I'll ever be dreaming, Katy Darling,
  Of thy love every day till I die,
  Farewell then, sweet Katy!

CHORUS 3
For the wild flowers will blossom, Katy Darling.
  And the love birds will warble on each tree;
But in heaven I shall meet thee, Katy Darling,
  For there, love, thou'rt waiting for me!
