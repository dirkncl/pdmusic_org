1. Down in the valley where the green rush groweth,
  Where the flow’rs so gay,
Load the air with their early fragrance,
  There liv’d Ida May.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Ida May sleeps where the wind harp breatheth
Musis sad and low,
Where the wild brook with its soft sweet murm’ring,
Chanteth the dirge of the early lost ones
With its ceaseless flow.

2. When the last rays of the golden sunset
  Glimmered o’er the sky,
Softly she said, while sweetly smiling,
  Ida May must die.

3. Oh, while I slept I saw bright beings
  Beckoning me away,
And angel voices gently calling,
  On your Ida May.

4. And in that throng so bright and holy,
  Stood dear Lilly Dale;
Oh, when I’m gone let me rest beside her,
  In the flowery vale.

5. List! hear you not those seraph voices,
  Chanting that same song
Farewell, dear Lilly I come to meet you,
  With the happy throng.
