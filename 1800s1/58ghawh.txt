1. In storms or shine two friends of mine, 
Go forth to work or play, 
And when they visit poor men’s bones, 
They bless them by the way; 
’Tis willing hand, ’tis cheerful heart, 
The two best friends I know; 
Around the hearth come joy and mirth 
Where’er their faces glow. 
Come shine— ’tis bright— 
come dark— ’tis light—  
Come cold, ’tis warm e’er long; 

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
So heavilly fall the hammer stroke, 
Merrily sound the song, the song, 
Heavily fall the hammer stroke, 
Merrily sound the song.

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Merrily, Merrily, merrily, merrily, 
merrily, sound the song, the song, 
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily 
merrily sound the song.

2. Who falls may stand, if good right hand 
is first— not second best, 
Who weeps may sing, if kindly heart 
Has logging in his breast; 
The humblest hoard has dainties pour’d, 
When they sit down to dine; 
The crust they eat is honey sweet, 
The water good as wine. 
They fill the purse with honest gold, 
They lead no creature wrong; 

3. Without these twain, the poor complain
Of evils hard to bear,
But with them, poverty grows rich
And finds a loaf to spare;
Their looks are fire— their words inspire—
Their deeds give courage high;
About their knees the children run,
Or climb they know now why—
Who sails, or rides, or walks with them,
Ne’er finds the journey long;
