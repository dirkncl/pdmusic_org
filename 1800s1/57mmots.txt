1.
Merrily, merrily over the sea!
Clearing the billows we're bounding along,
Waking deep echoes with frolic and glee,
Mocking the Syrens with music and song;
We have no fears of the green depths below
More than we feel for the blue sky above--
All that we care for as onward we go
Is reaching our homes and hearts that we love!

[(REFRAIN) repeat after each verse]
Ah, Merrily, merrily over the sea,
Merrily bounding over the sea,
Merrily, merrily over the sea,
Merrily o'er the sea, over the sea,
bounding merrily over the sea, over the sea,
Bounding over the sea!

2.
Surging around as the foaming waves curl,
White with the spray that is borne on the wind;
Making our track like a pathway of pearl,
Leaving the seabird far floating behind--
So we to our homes, and she to her nest
Speed on and on o'er the glittering tide,
Nothing can stay us, until we find rest,
A haven of love! and the lov'd at our side.
