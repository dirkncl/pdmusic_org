1.
Sitting in a corner
On a Sunday eve,
With a taper finger
Resting on your sleeve;
Starlight eyes are casting
On your face their light,
  Bless me, this is pleasant;
  Sparking Sunday night!

CHORUS
Bless me, this is pleasant,
Sparing Sunday night;
Ah! Bless me, this is pleasant,
Sparking Sunday night!

2.
How your heart is thumping
'Gainst your Sunday vest,
How wickedly tis working
On this day of rest!
Hours seem but minutes
As they take their flight,
  Bless me, this is pleasant;
  Sparking Sunday night!

(CHORUS)

3.
Dad and Mom are sleeping
On their peaceful bed,
Dreaming of the things
The folks in meeting said,
"Love ye one another"
Ministers recite,
  Bless me, don't we do it,
  Sparking Sunday night?

(CHORUS)

4.
One arm with gentle pressure
Lingers round her waist,
You squeeze her dimpled hand,
Her pouting lips you taste;
She freely slaps your face,
But more in love than spite,
  Oh, gracious! ain't it pleasant,
  Sparking Sunday night!

(CHORUS)

5.
But hark! the clock is striking,
Its two o'clock I mum,
As sure as I'm a sinner,
The hour to go has come;
You ask in spiteful accents,
If that old clock is right,
  And wonder if it ever
  Spark'd on Sunday night!

(CHORUS)

6.
One two three sweet kisses,
Four five six you hook,
But thinking that you rob her,
Give back those you took;
Then as forth you hurry
From the fair one's sight,
  Don't you wish each day
  Was only Sunday night!

(CHORUS)
