1. Alone in our cabin I’m sitting— ’tis night;
A snow shower is falling, the rooftree is white;
The wild winds are blowing, they would not be drear, 
With all their dark tumult, If Hally was there.

[Refrain 1]
’Tis March, and the verdure creeps softly and bright, 
O’er the forest boughs lately encrusted with white;
The red wood is spreading across the blue wave.
I bear the bright branches to cover his grave.

2. ’Tis June, and the thrushes fly out of the heat,
But all through the morning the singing is sweet;
I push back my tresses, and hush down my breath,
Finding pale for the music that’s faded to death.

2[Refrain 2]
The autumn, that corsair with banners of blood,
Makes war on the flowery linets of the wood;
Their pale ranks are broken, I mourn as I see;
But Hally, my darling, the grief is for thee.
