 "Will he come?  Oh if I could see him once
more -- there -- there that is him -- no he did not
speak that way to me -- he did not come and beat me --
Will he come?"

1.
"Will he come, oh, will he come;"
  Faintly cried a dying child;
Shall I never see him more,
  Who on me so sweetly smil'd;
Though my song was low and sad,
  And I tearfully did roam,
Still one voice come very kind,--
  "Will he come, oh, will he come?"

CHORUS [sung after 1st and 2nd verses]
Yes he'll come, oh, yes he'll come,
Where the lowly only tread,
Oh, I know he'll come to bless
Little Katy's dying bed!

2.
Oh, my home I know is drear,
  And my heart is sad and lone;
But there is a world above,
  Where sorrow is unknown.
Life with me will soon be past,
  I shall slumber in the tomb;
Let me hear that voice again--
  "Will he come. Oh! will he come!"

3.
Oh, I shall not die alone,
  For kind friends are around me now;
To wipe away the tear,
  And soothe my aching brow;
Hark! I hear that voice again,
  The same that urg'd me home,
She clasped him to her arms--
  He has come! Oh! yes he's come!

CHORUS [sung after last verse]
"Yes! I've come! Oh! yes I've come!"--
  How fast her failing breath!
Sorrow's tears shall weep no more--
  Little Katy sleeps in death!
