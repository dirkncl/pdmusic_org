1. The spider has woven his silken bridge,
And swung  it across the walk;
And high on the seabeat, slated ridge,
The heron and wild fowl stalk.
The sun went down but and hour ago
To the dusk of the crimson west,
And sailing low in a dreamy glow,
Is the moon with its silver crest.

2. The   grove  with its garden, the castle tall,
With its turrets, gothic and brown,
Shine out tonight for the festival,
By the ocean beyond  the town;
The chandeliers from their cres  sets glance
With a glimmer on silk and gold;
And the moonking shatters his silver lance,
On the seagates, white and cold.

3. There are none so fair in the brilliant throng,
As the blueeyed maidin Belle;
A year ago you could hear her song
Come echoing down the dell;
She is sad tonight, but her splendid hair
Drope down in a fleece of gold;
And her lustrous eyes with their beauty glare
And daze with a charm untold.

4. She is leaning over the lattice edge,
And her heart for its treasure craves;
Sweet music winds thro’ the gar den hedge,
But such memories crowd its waves,
That the past comes back, like a golden dream,
To fade to the moonlight dim—
’Tis the opening gates of her heav’n that gleam,
A vision bright of him!
