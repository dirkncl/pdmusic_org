1. Down in a southern valley at quiet close of day 
With friends all gathered round him, a dying negro lay; 
They listened to the accents ascending up in prayer 
“I’m going to my Saviour! Meet oh meet me there,” 

[REFRAIN and CHORUS sung after each verse]
“Meet me in heaven” was his feeble prayer 
“Master I am dying now, meet! oh! meet me there.”

2. The last farewell was spoken, the parting word was said,
And soon his soul was numbered forever with the dead,
They laid him down at midnight to sleep beneath the sod,
With solemn hymn and fervent prayer committing him to God.

3. When evening round is creeping and all our labor done,
We wander where he’s sleeping, so quiet and alone;
And as around is stealing the balmy summer air,
It seems to whisper softly “Meet! oh! meet me there!”
