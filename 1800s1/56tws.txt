1. Oh! a sacred thing is the wayside spring, 
That  runneth so clear and bright! 
That floweth along a gladsome thing, 
Nor stayeth by day or night 
When the thirsty Reaper laves his brow, 
When the harvest time is nigh And the Herdsman leads his Kine to bow, 
Where the sparkling waters lie. 
And the Herdsman leads his Kin to bow, 
Where its waters sparkling lie, 
Where its waters sparkling lie, 
Where its waters sparkling lie, 
Where its waters sparkling lie. 
Oh! a sacred thing is the wayside spring, 
That runneth so clear and bright, 
That floweth along, A gladsome thing, 
Nor stayeth by day or night.

2. A blessing be on the wayside spring, 
That givest health to all 
To the flow’rs that spring, the leaves that cling, 
Where the chrystal waters fall. 
Thy Pebbly grot makes glad the spot, 
When summer flow’rs are fled, 
Fount of the green sward that diest not, 
In thy clear and pearly bed, 
Fount of the green sward, that diest not, 
In thy clear and pearly bed, 
And thy waters sparkling lie, 
And thy waters sparkling lie, 
And thy waters sparkling lie. 
Oh! a sacred thing is the wayside spring, 
That runneth so clear and bright, 
That floweth along, A gladsome thing, 
Nor stayeth by day or night.
