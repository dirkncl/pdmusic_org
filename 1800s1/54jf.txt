1. Thy brow is high and arching fair,
Thy hair like raven’s wind,
Thy cheek hath charming dimples rare,
Thy voice melodious ring;
Thine eyes so faccinating bright,
So pure, so calm and deep,
It seems as if ’twould dim their light,
To close them e’er in sleep.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Oh! Julia Fay! sweet Julia,
Those happy days are past,
When I was favored with thy smiles,
And hoped that they would last.

2. Thy lovliness sweet Julia Fay,
Made all men worship thee,
And like a blessed sunshine ray,
Was thy sweet smile to me;
Thy love was all I sought to win,
Thy frowns I would not see,
I thought of nought the livelong day,
I dreamed of nought but thee.

3. And thou was cruel Julia Fay,
To flirt with me so long,
But though I grieve my heart away,
Still far from thee be wrong,
Thy life be an eternal dream
While all alone I sigh,
With not a joy in life’s dull stream,
Save thy dear memory.
