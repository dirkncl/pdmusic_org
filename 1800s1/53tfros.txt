1. ’Twas the first rose of summer 
That smiled on the morn, 
And blush’d thro the trees 
As the earliest born; 
It peep’d thro’ the foliage 
Encircled with dew, 
Unrivall’d in beauty 
For flowers were few. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
All hail to that rosebud, 
The first of its kind; 
May it never be cull’d, 
E’en a fair brow to bine. 
Let it bloom in its beauty, 
For short is its stay, 
And when others appear, 
It will wither away, 
Let it bloom in its beauty, 
For short is its stay, 
When others appear, 
It will wither away.

2. Oh! the summer may come 
With its myriad flow’rs 
To hand on the shrubs 
And a dorn the bright bow’rs. 
But tho’ gaudier far 
Be the hues of the rest, 
The first rose of summer 
Will still be the best.
