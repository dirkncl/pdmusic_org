1. Oh! the old, old clock of the house hold stock, 
 Was the brightest thing and neatest, 
Its hands tho’ old had a touch of gold 
 And its chime still rung the sweetest 
’Twas a monitor too, tho’ its words were few, 
 Yet they liv’d tho’ nations alter’d 
And its voice, still stong, warn’d old and young 
 When the voice of friendship falter’d.

CHORUS 1
“Tick, tick” it said, quick, quick to bed, 
For ten I’ve given warning. 
Up, up and go, or else you know 
You’ll never rise soon in the morning.

2. A friendly voice was that old, old clock,
 As it stood in the corner smiling,
And bless’d in time with a merry chime,
 The wintry hours beguiling;
But a cross old voice was that tiresome clock
 As it call’d at day break boldly,
When the dawn look’d grey o’er the misty way,
 And the early air blew coldly.

CHORUS 2
“Tick, tick it said” quick out of bed;
 For five I’ve given warning
You’ll never have health, you’ll never have wealth,
 Unless your up soon in the morning.

3. Still hourly the sound, goes round and round
 With a tone that ceases never,
While tears are shed, for the bright days fled
 And the old friends lost forever!
Its heart beats on, though hearts are gone,
 That warmer beat, and stronger—
Its hands still move, tho’ hands we love
 Are clasped on earth no longer!

CHORUS 3
“Tick, tick it said”— to the churchyard bed
 The grave hath given warning
Then up and rise, and look to the skies,
 And prepare for a heavenly morning!
