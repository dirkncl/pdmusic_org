1. Wake! Dinah, wake! the bright moon is beaming
  O’er the meadow, the cornfield and the hill;
And the stars, though no brighter than thy bright eyes, are gleaming
  O’er the earth all so calm and so still.
The violet in the glade is sleeping,
  The lily is bending o’er the rill,
The rose in tears of pearly dewdrops weeping,
  Near the river that flows calmly by the mill.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Wake! Dinah, wake! the bright moon is beaming
  O’er the meadow, the cornfield, and the hill,
And the stars, though no brighter than thy bright eyes, are gleaming
  O’er the earth, all so calm and so still.

2. Wake! Dinah, wake! the gentle breeze is blowing,
  The bird’s notes still hushed in the grove;
The ivy around the sturdy oak is growing,
  Clinging fondly as though something still to love
The shining river views it as onward rolling by,
  And as on golden sands the ripples break,
In sweet enchanting tones it seems to murmur,
  Wake, now my dearest Dinah, wake!

3. Wake! Dihan wake! and open thy lattice,
  My heart, love, can brook no delay;
How dearly I love to thy sweet voice to listen,
  More sweet than the lark’s morning lay.
Then come, dearest, come, for each throb of my heart,
  Speaks in language which love cannot mistake,
So true that from thee I cannot depart,
  Then wake, now my dearest Dinah, wake!
