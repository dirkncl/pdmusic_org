1. Oh! the home we loved by the bounding deep, 
Where the hills in glory stood; 
And the moss grown graves where our fathers sleep, 
’Neath the boughs of the waving wood; 
We remember yet with a fond regret 
For the rock and the flow’ry lea, 
Where we once used to play thro’ the long long day 
In the shade of the old mountain tree, 
In the shade of the old  mountain tree.

2. We are pilgrims now in a stranger land, 
And the joys of youth are passed; 
Kind friends are gone, but the old tree stands 
Unharm’d by the waring blast; 
Oh the lark may sing in the clouds of spring, 
And the swan on the silver sea, 
But we mourn for the shade where the wild bird made 
Her nest in the old mountain tree, 
Her nest in the old mountain tree.

3. Oh! the time went by like a tale that’s told 
In a land of song and mirth, 
And many a form in the churchyard cold, 
Finds rest from the cares of earth; 
And many a day will wande’r away, 
O’er the waves of the western sea, 
And the heart will pine, and vainly pray 
For a grave by the old mountain tree, 
For a grave by the old mountain tree.
