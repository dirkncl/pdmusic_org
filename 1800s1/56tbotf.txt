1. We cross the prairie as of old 
The pilgrims crossed the sea,  
To make the West as they   the East, 
The homestead of the free. 
We go to rear at wall of men 
On Freedom’s Southern line, 
And plant beside the cotton tree, 
The rugged Northern pine! 
[REFRAIN]
We cross the prairie as of old 
The Pilgrims crossed the sea, 
To make the West as they the East, 
The homestead of the free. 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
We cross’d the prairie as  of old 
The Pilgrims cross’d the sea, 
To make the West as they the East, 
The homestead of the free.

2. We’re flowing from our native hills,
As our free rivers flow—
The blessings of our motherland
Is on us as we go.
We go to plant her common schools
On distant prairie swells,
And give the Sabbath of the wild,
The music of her bells.
[REFRAIN]
We cross the prairie, as of old
The pilgrims crossed the sea,
To make the West, as they the East,
The homestead of the free.

3. Upbearing, like the Ark of old,
The Bible in our van,
We go to test the truth of God
Against the fraud of man.
So pause, now rest, save where the streams
That feed the Kansas run,
Save where the Pilgrim gonfalon
Shall flout the setting sun!
[REFRAIN]
We’ll sweep the prairie as of old
Our father’s swept the sea,
And make the West, as they the East,
The homestead of the free.
