1.
O! the old, old, clock, of the household stock,
Wss the brightest thing and neatest;
Its hands tho' old, had a touch of gold,
And its chime still rung the sweetest,
'Twas a monitor too, tho' its words were few,
Yet they liv'd thro' nations alter'd;
And its voice still strong, warn'd old and young,
When the voice of friendship falter'd.

CHORUS
Tick, tick, tick, tick, it said, quick, quick, quick to bed,
For _ten_ I've given worning.
Up, up and go, or else you know,
You'll never rise soon in the morning.

2.
A friendly voice, was that old, old clock,
As it stood in the corner smiling;
And bless'd the time with a merry chime,
The wintry hours beguiling,
But a cross old voice, was that tiresome old clock,
As it call'd at day break boldly;
When the dawn look'd gray, o'er the misty way,
And the early air blew coldly.

CHORUS
Tick, tick, tick, tick, it said, quick, quick, quick to bed,
For five I've given warning.
You'll never have health, you'll ne'er have wealth,
Unless you're up in the morning.
