"Tom sung the words of a well known Methodist Hymn.
    I see a band of spirits bright,
      That test the girls there,
    They all are robed in spotless white,
      And conquering palms they bear."
"Uncle Tom, I've seen them said Eva. They come to me sometimes in my sleep,
those spirits; and Eva's eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed in a low voice,
    They all are robed in spotless white,
      And conquering palms they bear.
    Uncle Tom, said Eva, I'm going there!"

[Words by Harriet Brecher Stowe (1811-1896), 1852]

1. Oh, Tom, I’ve seen those spirits bright,
How glorious they appear;
They come around my bed at night,
I love to have them near;
For then I see in to the skies,
Where all is bright and fair,
And Oh, no tears can, dim the eyes
Of those who dwell up there!

2. And when in grief I fall ssleep,
Those shining ones are near,
And whisper, Eva, do not weep,
We’ll wipe away each tear;
And then they sing of heav’nly love,
’Till I forget all care;
They tell me I’ve a home above,
And soon they’ll take me there!

3. E’n now, dear Tom, they round me throng,
In spotless robes of white;
I hear again their heav’nly song,
And Oh, what strange delight!
Now, now they beckon with their hands,
And point where all is fair.
Oh, how I long to join their hands
And, Tom, I’m going there!

4. A slumber soft as Angels know,
On Eva’s spiri lies,
And dreams too bright for aught bestow,
Dwell on her captur’d eyes.
She murmurs, “all are rob’d in white,
And conqu’ring palms they bear,”
In that sweet land there is no night,
And I am  going there!
