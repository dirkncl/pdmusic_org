[Third Hour.]
1. O slumberer, rouse thee! despise not the truth,
  But give thy Creator the days of thy youth;
Why standest there idle! the day breaketh— see!
  The Lord of the vineyard is waiting for thee.
“Holy Spirit, by thy poweer,
  Grant me yet another hour;
Earthly pleasures I would prove,
  Earthly joy and earthly love;
Scarcely yet has dawned the day;
  Holy Spirit, wait, I pray!”

[Sicth & Ninth Hour.]
2. O loiterer speed thee! the morn wears a pace;
  Then squander no longer the moments of grace,
But haste while there’s time! with thy Master agree;
  The Lord of the vineyard stands waiting for thee.
“Gentle Spiit, stay, oh stay,
  Brightly beams the early day;
Let me linger in these bowers;
  God shall have my noontide hours;
Chide me nor for my delay,
  Gentle Spirit, wait, I pray!”

[Eleventh Hour.]
3. O sinner arouse thee! thy morning is pass’d;
  Alreaddy the shadows are lengthening fast;
Escape for thy life! from the dark mountains flee;
  The Lord of the vineyard yet waiteth for thee.
“Spirit cease thy mounful lay,
  Leave me to myself, I pray;
Earth hath flung her spell around me,
  Pleasure’s silken chain hath bound me;
When the sun his path hath trod,
  Spirit, then I’ll turn to God.”

4. Hark! borne on the wind is the bell’s solemn toll;
  ’Tis mournfully pealing the knell of a soul—
The Spirit’s sweet pleasing and strivings are o’er;
  The Lord of the vineyard stands waiting no more.
