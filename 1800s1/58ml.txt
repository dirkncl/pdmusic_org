1. Come to me love for here I am waiting,
Sadly and lone by the dark rolling sea;
Cold winds are blowing, and strange voices moaning,
And fast flow the tears of thy Marion Lee.

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Oh why dost thou tarry so long on the ocean,
My poor heart is breaking in sorrow for thee!
Come to me love, for here I am waiting,
And fast flow the tears of thy Marion Lee.

CHORUS [sung after each Refrain]
Marion Lee, Marion Lee,
Never again shall his bark ride the billow;
Peaceful he sleeps where the seaflow’s are blooming,
And mermaids are watching his bright coral pillow.

2. Long have I watched thro’ the night’s gloomy shadows,
Gazing far out o’er the dark troubled sea;
Striving in vain, thro’ the mists that are hov’ring,
To catch but one glance of thy proud bark and thee.
