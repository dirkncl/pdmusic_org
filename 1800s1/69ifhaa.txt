1.
One afternoon as I walked out,
I met a damsel fair,
I never can forget that face,
And her pretty curly hair.
Her glossy ringlets playfully
About her shoulders lay,
I fancied her an angel,
As she tripp’d down Broadway.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Yes! I fancied her an angel,
She’d such a winning way,
This pretty little damsel,
As she tripp’d down Broadway.

2.
Of all the eyes I ever saw,
She had the sweetest pair,
And such a pretty little mouth,
A complexion light and fair;
Her style of dress so very neat,
So bewitching and so gay,
I fancied her an angel,
As she tripp’d down Broadway.

3.
Oh how I wish that I could meet
This damsel once again,
For ever since that I saw her,
My heart is full of pain.
Her image is before me,
All through each night and day,
This pretty little angel,
I saw tripping down Broadway.
