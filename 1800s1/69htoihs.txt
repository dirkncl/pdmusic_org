1.
I sleep upstairs in number nine,
Down at the big Hotel;
I live there with a friend of mine,
Who is a heavy swell
Of girls he knows a thing or two
On love he's very deep
But what I tell you now is true
He talks out in his sleep.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Listen to my pitiful tale
And pray a silence keep
I'll tell you all about the man
Who talks out in his sleep.

2.
He went to bed the other night,
He said that he was sick,
Not that I thought that he was right,
But drunker than old Nick
He went to sleep not very sound
His snore was like a bell
Till up he jump'd with one great bound
And call'd me his own Nell.

3.
One night we gently went to rest,
Still were our days alarms
He drew me closer to his breast,
And clasp'd me in his arms
I [-woke?] up by an awful snore
I thought that I would die,
When with one yell he relax'd the air
And murder was his cry.
