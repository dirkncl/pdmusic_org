1. A noble poet wrote about
  A tide in the affairs of man!
Which ebb and flow no one knows how,
  And making life but as a span.
The poet meant in plainer terms,
  (And which I’ll put into rhyme,)
That taking fortune at the flood,
  Is popping in at pudding time.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Popping in, popping in,
popping in at pudding time.
popping in, popping in,
popping in at pudding time.

2. That “time is money” some do say,
  And with some such a rule may stand;
But it don’t follow all are rich,
  Who may have lots of time on hand.
A favor wanted make you call
  Upon your friend when he is prime;
I mean the hour he’s din’d and win’d;
  That’s popping in at pudding time.

3. The chances are you’ll be receiv’d,
  But go earlier in the day;
He’ll be engag’d, can’t see a friend,
  And minus you will go away.
But most things are alike in life,
  But ridiculus and sublime;
If courting— ask her whilst she smiles—
  That’s popping in at pudding time.

4. A great word is opportunity
  And mind you, if you pass it o’er—
It casts you with impunity;
  It is gone— and comes no more,
Be vigilant with friend and foe
  And watch close— in ev’ry clime
You’ll mostly find the sweetest fare,
  By popping in at pudding time.

5. The sun will set and banks will close,
  And so will milk boil o’er and spill,
And had you watch’d it you’d have saved,
  And of the milk have had your fill:
In short, I could devote a book,
  Making lots of maxims chime;
All I desire to say is look
  To popping in, at pudding time.
