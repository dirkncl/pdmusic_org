1.
Noble Republic! happiest of lands,
Foremost of nations, Columbia stands --
Freedom's proud banner floats in the skies,
Where shouts of Liberty daily arise.
"United we stand divided we fall,"
"Union forever--" freedom to all!

CHORUS 2 times
Thoughout the world our motto shall be,
Vivi L'America, Home of the free.

2.
Should ever traitor rise in the land
Cursed be his homestead -- withered his hand --
Shame, be his mem'ry -- scorn, he his lot --
Exile, his heritage, his name, a blot!
"United we stand divided we fall,"
Granting a home and freedom to all;

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
To all her heroes -- Justice and Fame,
To all her foes, a traitor's foul name;
Our "stripes and stars" still proudly shall save,
Emblem of liberty, Flag of the brave;
"United we stand divided we fall,"
Gladly we'll die at our country's call;

(CHORUS 2 times)
