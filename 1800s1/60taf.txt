1. The American flag— will it e’er be disowned
  By the sons of that patriot band,
Who cheerfully offered their treasure and blood
  To rear it in this our fair land?
  Torear it in  this our fair land?
The American flag, that emblem of love,
  Will fanatical feuds lay it low?
While there beats but one heart for America true,
  Let him fear who would strike the fell blow.
  Let him fear that would strike the fell blow.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Flag of America ever float on
  Proudly o’er mountain and sea.
Sons of America cherish it still;
  As the guard of a people that’s free!
  As the guard of a people that’s free!

2. The American flag, the American flag,—
  May it ever float free o’er the land,
Binding firm heart to heart in a union of love,
  Defying the traitor’s foul hand.
  Defying the traitor’s foul hand.
The American flag our honor and pride,—
  Shall sectional strifes cause its fall;
Loud let the response ring wherever it waves,
  We’ll use in defence of it, —all!
  We’ll use in defence of it, —all!

3. In the days of oppression how proudly it waved,
  To cheer the tried patriots on;
And shall we desert it now peril is passed
  And the blessings of liberty won?
  And the blessings of liberty won?
God gant that it ever may wave o’er our heads
  An emblem of many in one,—
A passport to honor, a title to fame,
  For each of America's sons!
  For each of America's sons!
