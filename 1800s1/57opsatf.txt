1.
One farewell song, before we part,
A requiem o'er the joys we've known,
I would have graven on my heart
Thy latest look, thy fondest tone;
To linger o'er by night and day,
To cheer me on thro' ev'ry ill,
And find by mem'ry's aid--
I may gaze on those eyes and hear thee still!
And find by mem'ry's aid--
I may gaze on those eyes and hear thee still!
hear thee still!
Gaze on those eyes and hear thee still!

2.
Oh! 'twas a dream, that happy _Past_,
From which alas! we now awake
To learn Love's wreath we wove so fast,
Has only bound us, but to break!
Hope's blossoms wither'd! watch'd in vain
How priz'd our bursting hearts can tell,
Yet let me hear thy voice again--
One parting song, and then farewell!
Yet let me hear thy voice again,
One parting song, and then farewell!
then farewell!
One parting song, and then Farewell!
