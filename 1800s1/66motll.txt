1. Look where our starry banner floats above,
And listen to our bugles as they blow!
Once more we rally to the cause we love,
As we rallied when it rang long ago.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Naught we care, although our numbers be few,
And feeble be each veteran’s hands:
The Loyal Legion still is true
[overlapping voices]
To the Father land.
  Banner of the Father land.

2. Proudly in youth we march’d the foe to meet,
And joyously we brav’d the battlestorm;
Danget we counted not, nor found defeat
With the current in our hearts leaping warm! 

3. Comrades who slumber in the glorious gave,
Forever we will cherish your renown;
Priceless the treasure you have died to save;
We will guard it till  our arms we lay down!
