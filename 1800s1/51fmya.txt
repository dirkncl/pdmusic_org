1. 
The merry matin song is heard, 
  The emerald plains appear, 
And wreath’d with flow’rs sweet May returns, 
  The gem of all the year; 
But, O, to me it has a voice, 
  Whose sweetness none can know, 
It whispers words which thrill’d our hearts, 
  Full many years ago.

2. 
Each bosom fill’d with gladness now, 
  Bids care good bye to day, 
While ev’ry voice pours forth a song 
  To welcome rosy May; 
But, O, to me there is no light 
  So bright as mem’ry’s glow, 
And dearest, thou art just the same 
  As many years ago.

3. 
’Tis true, thy auburn locks then wav’d
  Like sunlight round thy brow,
The rose was fresher on thy cheeks,
  Thine eyes more bright thatn now;
But, O, thy love has known no change,
  Nor ceas’d in strength to grow,
Since first I press’d thee to my heart
  Full many years ago.

4. 
Our spring of life has pass’d away,
  The summer time is here,
Soon autumn’s sober hours will come,
  And winter chill and drear;
But, O, to us ’tis always May,
  Our hearts no seasons know,
Since first the twain were blent in one,
  Full many years ago.
