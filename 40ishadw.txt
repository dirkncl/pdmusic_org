1.
As I walk'd out last Sunday night,
The wedder it was hazy--
A pretty Girl I chanced to meet--
Oh! She set this color'd man crazy!

CHORUS 2 times, for 1st, 2nd, 3rd Verses
I seen her at the window,
It was my dear Lucinda;
She dress'd so neat, and look so sweet,
I'd gin my life to bin in thar.

2.
Her hair was curl'd tight round her head,
I could not keep from grinning;
I really thought I should suspire,
When I heard dat yaller girl singing.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
I go to de door and pull de string,
De bell it kept a ringing;
Den she cum down and let me in,
And dis here song kept singing.

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
I got inside, I took a seat,
And I thought I was a gonner;
Dar sat her beau, Julius Crow,
A noddin in de corner.

CHORUS 2 times, for 4th Verse
So I left her at de window,
I kissed my hand Lucinda;
She dress'd so neat, and look so sweet,
I wish dis nigga hadn't been dar.
