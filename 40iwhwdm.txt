1. 
I wish he would decide Mamma 
I wish he would decide 
I’ve been a bridesmaid many times 
When shall I be  a bride; 
My cousen Anne and sister Fan, 
The nuptual knot have tied, 
Yet come what will I’m single still, 
Yet come what will I’m single still, 
I wish he would decide, 
When shall I be a bride, 
When shall I be a bride, 
For come what will I’m single still, 
I wish he would decide.

2. He takes me to the play Mamma,
And brings me pretty books,
He woos me with his eyes Mamma,
Such speechless things he looks,
Where ere I roam, abroad at home,
He lingers by my side,
Yet come what will I’m single still,
Yet come what will I’m single still,
I wish he would decide
When shall I be a bride,
When shall I be a bride,
For come what will I’m single still,
I wish he would decide.

3. I’ve thrown out many a hint Mamma,
I’ve spoke of other beaux,
I’ve talk’d about domestic life,
And sung “they don’t propose”
Then if he means to break Mamma,
My passion and my pride
Unconquer’d yet I’ll scorn regret
Unconquer’d, yet I’ll scorn regret
Although he wont decide
Although he wont decide,
Although he wont decide
Unconquer’d yet I’ll scorn regret,
Although he wont decide.
