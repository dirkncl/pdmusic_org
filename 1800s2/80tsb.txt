1. ’Tis sweet to hear the Sabbath bell,
Whose soft and silv’ry chime
Breaks on the ear with fall and swell,
Wafting our tho’ts from time.
I love to hear its mellow strain
Come floating on the dell;
While wending to that sacred fane,
Where chimes the Sabbath bell.

2. How mem’ry mingles with that peal!
How hours of other years!
How sad the tho’ts, while pensive steal
My slowly trickling tears!
Tho’ts, mournful to my bossom lone,
Yet, those I would not quell;
For, soothing to my grief, that tone
Of time, sweet Sabbath bell.

3. A few years more, the winds, so bland,
Will bid the young flow’rs wave,
Which oh, perhaps some rindly hand
Will plant around my grave!
I’ll miss thy dear, familiar voice,
Which, ah, so oft could tell
My heart, tho’ tempesttossed, “rejoice,”
Thou dear, dear Sabbath bell.
