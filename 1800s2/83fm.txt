1. In the silence of the evening, 
I am sitting all alone 
And my heart is sorely grieving 
For the happy days bygone; 
And in sorrow I am thinking 
Of a face I ne’er may see, 
Whilst the stars are softly twinkling 
I am thinking of Marie.

CHORUS (or SOLO) [sung after each verse]
Farewell, Marie! 
We may never 
Meet on this cold earth again, 
Hard it was from thee to sever, 
Oh, why couldst thou not remain!

2. She was gentle, mild and tender, 
With a lustrous beaming eye 
Which in brightness and in splendor 
Shone like stars up in the sky; 
But she’s gone away forever, 
Her sweet face is lost to me, 
Oh! my yearning heart will never 
Cease to throb for dear Marie.

3. Oft I see the placid river 
Where I walk’d with my Marie 
When the Love— God from his quivor 
Shot an arrow into me. 
Oh! that arrow now is galling 
My poor heart so sad and sore 
While my faithfull voice is calling 
Her dear name forevermore.
