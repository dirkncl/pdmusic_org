1.
Hither maidens, merry maidens!
Come and view my magic glass;
I can tell you many marvels,
All things asa they're sure to pass!
I can see adventure growing
Through a mystic pow'r sublime;
Watch the hand of fortune throwing
Treasures in the band of time!
Come then, maidens, merry maidens,
Come and see my magic glass;
All the wonders I shall whisper,
True as time, are sure to pass!


2.
Time, that like a seed appeareth,
Dry and dark, and hard to view;
I can show you how it reareth
Leaf; and bud, and flow'ret too!
Seal of friendship, coyly hidden;
Flow'r of love, that shuns the sight;
Come then, maidens, merry maidens,
Come and see my magic glass;
All the wonders I shall whisper,
True as time, are sure to pass!

3.
Like a stage I see the future;--
Signs and symbols o'er it crowd,
WIld as wintry stars at midnight,
And they speak to me aloud:
Tell me secrets worth believing,
Secrets with instructions rife
Come then, maidens, merry maidens,
Come and see my magic glass;
All the wonders I shall whisper,
Sure as time, will come to pass!
