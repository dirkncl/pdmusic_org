1. Oh! have ye heard de news,  
And have ye seen de bills? 
It’s all about ole Uncle Joe, 
Heb come to town wid his ole banjo, 
And when he plays it always kills— 
Oh! have ye heard de news?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! have ye heard de news? 
Dat’s guine all around? 
De balm of Gilead at last am found, 
De Banjo Boss am  come to town, 
And we’re all gwine down to de show.
Brace up, Oh! give us a rest.

2. Oh! I am gwine wid dear,  
To hear dis ole man sing 
De tunes de lubly angels sing, 
Away down in Jerusalum. 
Dey say de tears he always bring— 
Oh! have ye heard de news?

3. Den chase away de blues, 
Dat fill de heart wid pain, 
And clay away de spoons and plates, 
And bar up all de doors and gates, 
His like ye’ll never see again— 
Oh! have ye heard de news?

4. Den come along all you’ve 
Dat have not wept for years. 
De man hab come, de “Boss” ob all, 
De only one who  cure de glum— 
From ev’ry eye he bring de tears— 
Oh! have ye heard de news?
