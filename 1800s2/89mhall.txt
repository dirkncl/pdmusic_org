1.
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb;
Mary had a little lamb,
  Its fleece was white as snow;
And ev-ery where that Mary went, Mary went, Mary went,
Ev-ery where that Mary went,
  The lamb was sure to go.

CHORUS
Bah! bah! bah! bah!
Bah! bah! bah! bah!
For we's gwine to have a great jubilee,
For we's gwine to have a great jubilee,
In de presence of de Zion and mighty king,
Away down de promised land.
Bye and bye we're going forth to meet them,
Bye and bye we're going forth to meet them,
Bye and bye we're going forth to meet them
Away down de primised land.

2.
She took the lamb to school one day, to school one day, to school one day;
She took the lamb to school one day,
  Was against the rule;
It made the children laugh and play, laugh and play, laugh and play,
It made the children laugh and play,
  To see the lamb at school.

(CHORUS)

[All verses sung in the same format.]

3.
Oh how they looked at Mary's lamb,
  Which bellowed bahlie ye,
Its pretty face -- Its face so white,
  Oh! what a sight to see.

(CHORUS)

4.
It made the children laugh and gaze,
  To see such a sight at school,
The boys and girls then shouted praise,
  And danced around the stool.

(CHORUS)

5.
Around the benches it did run,
  The boys they thought it boss,
The girls they lauged right out for fun,
  Which made the teacher cross.

(CHORUS)

6.
The teacher now got awful mad,
  And raising aloft her stick,
It felt across the back of a boy,
  Which made him very sick.

(CHORUS)

7.
The teacher's beau just came in then,
  He face got awful red,
The lamb it ran between him legs,
  And stood him on his head.

(CHORUS)

8.
All the girls then laughed out loud
  The boys set up a shout
The teacher's beau then got right up
  And said she'd put him out.

(CHORUS)

9.
The teacher thought it quite remiss,
  To see him act so rude,
The boys and girls commenced to hiss,
  At what they called a dude.

(CHORUS)

10.
The teacher gave the door a push,
  And called for Parson Heamans,
She found him at a huckleberry bush,
  Eating some ripe persimmons.

(CHORUS)

11.
Yes boy and girls in every clime,
  Still Mary's lamb adore,
In every school her voice has chimed,
  The same old song your parents sang before.

(CHORUS)
