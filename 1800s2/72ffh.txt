1. Lonely I wander, in sadness and pain, 
Longing to look on my dear ones again; 
Clouds of misfortune are over me cast, 
Sadly I weep when I think of the past! 
No glance of pity or kindness I see, 
None seem to care for my sorrow or me; 
Lost in the whirl of the city I roam,— 
Friendless, forsaken, I’m far, far from home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Homeless and weary, I’m plodding my way, 
Lost among strangers, from day unto day, 
No place of shelter ’neath you cheerless dome,
Friendless, forsaken, i’m far, far from home.

2. Once I was happy, and loved ones were near, 
Friends and companions were gentle and dear! 
Still I remember my mother’s delight,— 
Clasp’d in her arms while she bade me “good night.” 
Cold are the faces that now pass me by,— 
What is there left for me now but to die? 
Lost in the whirl of the city I roam,— 
Hopeless and helpless, I’m far, far from home.

3. Bright are the homes that I see on each side, 
Mansions of wealth, and of love and of pride; 
Once I’d a home just as bright and  as fair,— 
Loved ones and dear onces to welcome me there! 
Father of all, in Thy pity look down, 
Help me, tho’ darkly the tempest may frown; 
Watch o’er my footsteps while sadly I roam,— 
Save Thy poor wand’rer, so far, far from home.
