1. My darling she has beauty, 
My darling she has grace, 
And when her bright eyes sparkle, 
They light up all her face, 
Yet their glance is so uncertain, 
Tho’ I scarcely like to own it, 
That I sometimes think I love her, 
And I sometimes think I don’t.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I’ve seen her at the concert, 
And I’ve watch’d her at the ball, 
Amidst a host of beau ties, 
She still outshines them all.
I’ve seen her at the concert, 
And I’ve watch’d her at the ball, 
Amidst a host of beau ties, 
She still outshines them all.

2. She has a troop of lovers, 
For she is not over shy, 
And many hearts are beating, 
For’one sparkly of her eye, 
Her ways too are so winning, 
That tho’ bid them hope she won’t.
Each fancies that she loves him, 
Tho’ she always says “I don’t.”

3. I often sit and watch her,
As some well loved song she sings,
The while her little fingers,
Sweep like magic o’er the strings.
And arch smile sometimes greets me,
And tho’ speak my mind I won’t.
I feel then that I love her,
Tho  I try to think I don’t.

4. But can I call her darling,
With such uncertain love,
When doubts that are distressing,
One kind word would remove.
Oh I could say with pleasure,
If she to me were true,
That I always thought I loved her,
But now I’m sure I do.
