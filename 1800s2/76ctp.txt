1. Jump on board now, one and all,
Take the coach for Pelham,
Hark! the Bugler sounds the call,
“All aboard for Pelham.”
Goodbye Brunswick Hear we go,
Rocking on to Pelham,
Up and down, and to and fro,
On the coach for Pelham.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On the coach for Pelham,
Hear the long horn blowing;
Dashing on for Pelham,
Bless me! how we’re going,
Sound the horn “yoho! again,
Snap the whip now, Colonel Kane!
Give the “fourinhand” full rein,
Be on time at Pelham.

2. Noby gents in seats on top,
Coaching it to Pelham,
Always ready for a stop,
On the way to Pelham.
Lovely ladies dress’d so neat,
Takig coach to Pelham,
Chatting over such a treat,
As a ride to Pelham.

3. Oh! it is a charming sight,
From the coach for Pelham,
Joyful times and prospects bright,
As we drive to Pelham.
Over bridge and hill and dale,
Speeding on for Pelham,
See! the town at last we hail,
Just on time at Pelham.
