1. Old Farmer John from his work came home one summer afternoon,
And sat him down ’neath a maple tree, and he sung himself a tune;
He sang till the cows came running up, and round him fomed a ring,
For they never heard good old Farmer John attempt befor to sing.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
And this is the tune
Ri fol dol da do,
Sung in the maple grove,
Ri fol dol da dol ri fol dol da,
’Tis the tune the old cow died on.

2. The oldest cow in the farmer’s herd tried hard to join the song,
But she could not strike the melody ’tho her voice was loud and strong;
The farmer laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks like apples red,
But the cow was mad, and she tried to sing until she dropped down dead.

3. Old Farmer John had an inquest held to see what killed the cow,
The jury sat and a verdict brought which I mean to tell you now,
They said the cow would be living yet to chew her cud with glee,
If old Farmer John had not sung that song beneath the maple tree.
