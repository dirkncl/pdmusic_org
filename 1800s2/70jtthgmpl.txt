1. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I love. 
They will call back the days when together we sat, 
On the porch ’neath the nest of the dove. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
It brings fond recollections to me. 
You remember the mocking bird mimick’d it once, 
As it perch’d on the sycamore tree. 
Just touch the harp gently my pretty Louise. 
Just touch the harp gently Louise. 
Oh! touch the harp gently my pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that I love. 
They will call back the days when together we sat, 
On the porch ’neath the nest of the dove.

2. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I love. 
They’ll recall the bright days when we play’d in the wood, 
And watch’d the birds flitting above. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
The words I remember them well. 
I lov’d it, and when you had finish’d each verse, 
I kiss’d you and said never tell. 
Just touch the harp gently my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently Louise. 
Oh! touch the harp gently my pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that I love. 
They’ll recall the bright days when we play’d in the wood,
And watch’d the birds flitting above.
