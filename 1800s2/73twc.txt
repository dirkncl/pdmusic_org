Lo! the bent bow! ’tis the sign
Nationality still lives,
Sons of Cambria hear the call,
Sons of Cambria hear the call.
Hasten to obey and obey with speed.

Hasten to Snowdonia’s height
Hasten to Snowdonia’s height
The Crimson Dragon waves in sight,
The Crimson Dragon waves, waves in sight,
Come from every vale and hill,
Come with patriotic will.
Come with arms, bright arms renown’d,
Hear the bugle’s joyous sound.
Hear the sound, the joyous sound!
Hear the sound, the joyous sound!
Freedom’s sons the trumpet blow
’Tis the knell of wrong and woe— wrong and woe.

Come from where the green vale lies,
Come from where the streamlets rise
All whose hearts beat high and free
Come from land and come from sea
All who would the sword lift high
All who can the strong bow ply
who can the strong bow ply

Let all things rest as they befall
Leave all concerns both great and small
The herds on hill; in dale, forsake,
The fisher’s net, the boat on lake;
Come from the field, desert the plough
And leave the dead, the dead is resting now.
What though no turf his form may hide!
What though no turf his form may hide!
Leave maiden at the altar’s side!

Gather! Gather like wild whirlwinds blend.
Gather! Gather like wild whirlwinds blend,
When the stately oak they rend
Dash onward like the rushing wave!
Dash onward like the rushing wave!
When ships are wreck’d no arm to save,

Come Chieftains, Patriots, young and old,
United all in phalanx bold,
’Tis Cambria calls you,
She calls you to prepare,
High honor soon with her to share,
Your Leader’s flags on Snowdon wave,
Your Leader’s flags on Snowdon wave,
Your Leader’s flags on Snowdon wave,
Haste hasten! Haste hasten!
Haste hasten to Llewelyn brave!
Haste hasten! Haste hasten!
Haste hasten to Llewelyn brave! to Llewelyn brave!
