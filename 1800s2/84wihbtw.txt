When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall,
And milk comes frozen home in pail:
When blood is nipp’d, and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl
To-who! To-whit! To-whit! 
To-who! a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

When all aloud the wind doth blow,
And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,
And birds sit brooding in the snow,
And Marlan’s nose looks red and raw;
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
Then nightly sings the staring owl
To-who! To-whit! To-whit!
To-who! a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot, the pot 
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
