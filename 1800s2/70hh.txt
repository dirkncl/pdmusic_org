Here’s “How!” [1870]
SOLO AND CHORUS

"How" was the toast which was universal among the Officers of the
Army of the Potomac, and derives its signicance from a Sioux word, of
a like pronunciation, which means "good luck." The word is still in use
among the Officers of the Regular Army.--_Army and Navy Journal_.

1. Fill up with merry hearts, dear friends,
And mock the hours too fleeting;
This night for parting makes ameads,
I give my final greeting;
May mem’ries of the olden times
Be ever dear as now.
Stand up and drink it, ev’ry one,
The old times, boys, Here’s “how.”

CHORUS 1
Stand up and drink it, ev’ry one,
The old times, boys, Here’s “how.”

2. The flag, the dear old flag we love,
That brav’d the storm and rattle
Of troublous times, when makes fortune frown’d,
And chance gave way the battle;
That flutter’d o’er us as we scaled
Old Lookout’s beetling brow.
Up, up, and drain a parting glass,
God bless the flag, Here’s “bow.”

CHORUS 2
Up! up! and drain a parting glass,
God bless the flag. Here’s “how.”

3. Silence! remember all the men,
Our comrades ever cherished,
Who dropped so silently away!
The gallant hearts who perished
On many fields! the men we loved,
Whose mem’ries thrill us now.
God bless them in their honor’d graves,
Our comrades gone! Here’s “how.”

CHORUS 3
God bless them in their honor’d graves,
Our comrades gone! Here’s “how.”

4. The ladies! fill your goblets high,
All honors to them giving,
The soldier’s constant champions,
They make our life worth living;
With loyal hearts, in reverence,
Each to his idol bow,
Tender and true! up! ev’ry one,
‘Sweethearts and wives!’ Here’s “how.”

CHORUS 4
Tender and true! up! ev’ry one,
‘Sweethearts and waves!’ Here‘s “how.”

5. Now while each eye is kindling bright,
Each warm heart quickly beating,
A last word, mine, to say goodbye,
Good luck, and hopes for meeting
In the dim future all of you!
My voice will scarce allow
The words; but drink my parting toast!
Goodbye the mess! Here’s “how.“

CHORUS 5
Up! up! and drink my parting toast,
Goodbye the mess! Here’s “how.”
