He sail’d away at break of day,
The skies were blue and fair,
He kiss’d his bonnie hand to me,
With heart as light as air.
“Hark” ye he cried:
“Go watch the tide
As it cometh up to Lynn;
For foul or fair,
I will be there
When the flowing tide comes in!”

I watch’d the clouds that came in crowds,
Like flocks of evil birds,
My heart sank low with bitter woe,
Rememb’ring Donald’s words,
Rememb’ring Donald’d words.
“O God!” I cried, and none beside
Knew the grief my heart within!
“O give me back my bonnie lad
None else my love can win!
O give me back my bonnie lad,
When the flowing tide comes in!
When the flowing tide comes in.”

Across the strand far up the land,
The fierce, wild waters swept!
Laid at my feet, a burden sweet,
With smile as if he slept!
I could now weep, so soft his sleep,
For fear ’twoud waken him!
I could not weep, so soft his sleep,
For fear ’twould waken him.
Peace let him rest,
Peace let him rest,
God knowesth best!
And the flowing tide comes in,
The flowing, tide comes in,
Peace let him rest,
God knoweth best!
“And the flowing tide come in.
