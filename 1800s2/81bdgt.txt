1. Oh! sister Hannah whar you am?
  Oh! blow de trumpet!
Is you done jine de shoutin ban’?
  Blow de golden trumpet!
Oh! whar’ you gwine to be when de worl breaks up?
  Oh! blow de trumpet
Is you gwine to be a drinkin from de golden cup?
  Blow de golden trumpet!
I know brudder Satan by de rollin’ ob his eye,
An’ I jes lay low an’ I let him trabble by,
But I nebber shall forget it till de day I die,
  Blow de golden trumpet!

2. Sometimes I’se up, sometimes I’se down,
  Oh, blow de trumpet!
I spec I’se gwine to wear de crown,
  Blow de golden trumpet!
I’se gwine to meet de sisters at de big white gate,
  Oh, blow de trumpet!
An’ I’ll meet you at de crossin, if you aint too late,
  Blow de golden trumpet!
I climb up a tree, for I didn’t want to stop.
An’ jes den I think dat I hear suffin drop,
’Twas nuffin but dis nigger, dat was climbin to de top,
  Blow de golden trumpet!

3. Now when dat I do come to die,
  Oh, blow de trumpet!
Oh, sister Hannah dont you cry,
  Blow de golden trumpet!
I want to be an angel when I git up in de sky,
  Oh, blow de trumpet!
An’ a sailin on de clouds, when de wedder am dry,
  Blow de golden trumpet!
I pitch my tent at de breakin ob de morn,
An’ put on my robe, fo’ I think I hear de horn,
But I nebber’s so mistooken since de day I’se born,
  Blow de golden trumpet!
