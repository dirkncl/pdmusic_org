1.
GUDE WIFE
The wind is blowing cold from the west,
And your hair is gray and thin;
Come in old Ad-am and shut the door,
Come in old Ad-am, come in.
OLD ADAM
The wind is blowing out of the west,
Cold, cold and my hair is thin!
But it is not there; that face so fair,
Then why should I go in?

2.
GUDE WIFE
The wind is blow-ing cold from the west,
And the day is al-most gone,
Come in old Ad-am and shut the door,
The night will soon be com-ing on.
OLD ADAM
The wind is blow-ing out of the west,
My heart it is bow'd with care
For the sun of my life for e'er hath flown,
And the night is ev-'ry where.

3.
GUDE WIFE
The crick-ets chirps and your chair is set
Where the fire shines warm and clear;
Come in old Ad-am and you'll for-get
It is not the spring of the year.
OLD ADAM
The wind is blow-ing out of the west,
Cold, cold and my hair is thin
But 'tis not there now, that pure sweet brow,
Then why should I go in?
