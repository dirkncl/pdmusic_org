1. When you meet me at the brook,
In the golden weather,
And you sweetly on my look,
Talking there together;
Should my eyes be on your bent,
At the sunset’s gleaming,
Don’t you think that love is meant:
Make believe I’m dreaming!
Don’t you think that love is meant;
Make believe I’m dreaming!

2. When you wander side by side,
By the rippling river,
If to clasp my hand you tried,
Vowing truth forever;
Should mine nestle in your own,
While the stars are beaming,
Lay it to the time alone;
Make believe I’m dreaming!
Lay it to the time alone;
Make believe I’m dreaming!

3. When you leave me at the gate,
In the golden weather,
And the hours are wearing late,
Talking there together;
Should you ask me for a kiss,
Eyes with lovelight beaming,
If ’tis your remember this,—
Make believe I’m dreaming!
If ’tis your remember this,
Make believe I’m dreaming!
