"Moet and Chandon" (1871)
Sequel to Champagne Charlie.
Words by H. Hurrille
Music by George Leybourne

1.
What care I if the world's turn'd round,
No let it turn and turn again,
No matter if its upside down,
It still produces good Champagne.
Never care I how times may go,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!
Motet and Chandon still drown all woe,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!

CHORUS 2 times
Champagne Charlie was my name,
Champagne drinking gain'd my fame,
So as of old when on the spree,
Moet and Chandon's the wine for me.

2.
The people may of Paris talk,
And call that City fine and gay,
Whene'er I visit La Belle France,
Esparney's where I make my stay,
Down on the banks where the streamlets flow,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!
Purple and gold do the grape vines grow,
  Oh! I oh! I oh!

(CHORUS 2times)

3.
White wines are pale and have no taste,
The red indeed have too much hue,
Moselle in pleasing often fails,
Still Hock's too slow and suits but few,
Burgundy Sherry, Greek wines, Bor deaux,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!
Like Port from Spain do but taste so, so,
  Oh! I oh! I oh!

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
Champagne's the wine for giving toasts,
Let husbands pledge there buxom wines,
Whilst lovers drink to sweet hearts true,
And Bachelors to married lives,
They'll not keep single for long I know,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!
Bach'lors by "Cham" will be turn'd to beaux,
  Oh! I oh! I oh!

(CHORUS 2 times)

5.
So come who'll join my jolly crowd,
At midnight we'll commence the spree,
Hurrah for "Cham" we'll shout aloud,
And laugh, and chaff, and sing with glee,
Popping of corks shall let people know,
  Oh! I oh! oh! I oh!
"Cham" does as freely as water flow,
  Oh! I oh! I oh!

(CHORUS 2 times)
