1. Sad and lonely are the hours today, 
Where mourning hearts in sorrow bide;
Joy and comfort now are flown away, 
The weary hours in darkness glide.
No more we’ll clasp the loving hand, 
No more the    loving smile we’ll greet.
Grief and pity rule the stricken land, 
And mournful words our lips repeat.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Weeping, weeping, sadly, sadly,
For the homes bereft today, homes bereft,
See the many bitter tears now fall
For those who sleep beneath the clay.

2. Tears of pity for the fond and true 
That leave us hear so  sad and drear;
Sweet their sleep beneath the flow’rs and dew, 
While sad and lone we wander here.
We toil the knell of sad despair, 
And think upon the homes of pain;
Tears of sorrow now are falling there 
For those who ne’er will come again.

3. Gone, in all the bloom and pride of life, 
Oh, sad the hearts they leave behind;
Gone, and left us in the weary strife, 
The fair, the loving true and kind.
In homes of sorrow and distress, 
Oh may the light of heaven shine;
Peace and comfort now the weary bless, 
And hush the hearts that now repine.
