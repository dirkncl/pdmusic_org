1. Mother, oh! sing me to rest,
Sing the sweet songs I remember,
Songs that I love fond and tender,
Songs to relieve my sad breast.

2. Sadly my heart is opprest,
Night dews are mournfully weeping;
And the sweet roses are sleeping,
Mother, oh sing me to rest!

3. Take thy sweet bird to its nest!
How my sad bosom is aching,
Surely my poor heart is breaking,
Mother oh, sing me to rest!
