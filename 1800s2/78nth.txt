1. Thanks do we give Thee gracious Lord, 
For the fruit the harvest yields; 
Thy name forever be ador’d! 
For our verdant fertile fields, 
For peace and plenty Thou hast shower’d 
On our natal land so fair; 
For the rich gifts which Thou has dower’d, 
Lord, accept each heartfelt pray’r. 

CHORUS 1. 
For peace and plenty Thou hast shower’d 
On our natal land so fair; 
For the rich gifts which Thou hast dower’d 
Lord, accept each heartfelt pray’r.

2. Thanks for Thy counsel, wise and just: 
Thou hast rul’d with loving sway, 
Thanks for the dear fraternal trust 
In the Nation’s heart today; 
Thanks for the unity that’s grown 
Where the seeds of discord die; 
Thanks for the germs of concord sown 
’Neath our Union’s starry sky. 

CHORUS 2. 
Thanks for the unity that’s grown 
Where the seeds of discord die; 
Thanks for the germs of concord sown 
’Neath our Union’s starry sky!

3. Thanks for the good on ev’ry hand, 
For our gran’ries stor’d with corn, 
For Southern, West, and Eastern land 
Where there flows sweet plenty’s horn, 
Thanks for the gifts Thou bringest us, 
May we lay them at thy throne, 
Thou Heav’nly Father glorious! 
Thanks we yield to Thee alone! 

CHORUS 3. 
Thanks for the gifts Thou bringest us, 
May we lay them at Thy throne; 
Thou Heav’nly Father glorious! 
Thanks we yield to Thee alone!
