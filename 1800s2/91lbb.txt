To W. S. O.
"Little Boy Blue" (1891) (Op. 12, No. 4)
Words by Eugene Field
Music by Ethelbert Nevin, 1862-1901

The little toy dog is cover'd with dust,
But sturdy and staunch he stands;
The little toy soldier is red with rust,
And his musket moulds in his hands.

Time was when the little toy dog was new,
And the soldier was passing fair;
And that was the time when our little Boy Blue
Kiss's them, and put them there.

"Now don't you go till I come!" he said,
"And don't you make any noise,"
So toddling off to his trundle bed,
He dreamt of the pretty toys.

And as he was dreaming, an angel song
Awaken'd our little Boy Blue.
Oh! the years are many, the years are long,
But our little toy friends are true.

Ay! faithful to little Boy Blue they stand,
Each in the same old place,
Awaiting the touch of the little hand,
The smile of a little face.

And they wonder as waiting these long years thro',
In the dust of that little chair,
What has become of our little Boy Blue,
Since he kiss'd them, and put them there.
