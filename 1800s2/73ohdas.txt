1. Oh! de bells dey rang when Massa went and died,
  Oh! how d’y do, Aunt Susie?
And de darkies dey all holler’d and they cried,
  Away down South in sunny Georgia,
Dey cried all day till dere eyes were very red,
  Oh! yes, go tell the people Susie;
Oh! dey’ve cried so hard, took de wool all off dere head,
  Away down in de cotton land.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! my, don’t cry,
Der’s a heap ob trouble brewing all de time,
But we’ll hab good times when we go to join de band,
Away down in dat happy land.

2. Oh! go way old Peter don’t you bodder me,
  Oh how d’y do, Aunt Susie?
I look at de clouds, to see what I can see,
  Away down South in sunny Georgia,
I see black angels a flying in de air,
  Oh! yes, go tell the people Susie;
Oh! dey’ve  got humble bees a sticking in dere hair,
  Away downn in de cotton land.

3. Oh! I’ll go to work wid all my might and main,
  Oh how d’y do, Aunt Susie?
But I’ll take my time for I know it’s guine to rain,
  Away down South in sunny Georgia,
Dat nigger Pete is as lazy as a hog
  Oh! yes, go tell the people Susie;
For he looks like a bullfrog sitten on a log
  Away down in de cotton land.
