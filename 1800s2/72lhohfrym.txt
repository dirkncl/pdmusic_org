1.
Happy faces round you Mother,
  Gather in the cheery light,
Merry songs and pleasant laughter
  Fill our home with joy tonight.
Fondest hearts are here to greet you,
  Loving lips your name to bless,
Shelt’ring arms to shield and guard you,
  Tender hands with sweet caress.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Happy faces round you Mother,
gather in the cheery light,
Merry songs and pleasant laughter
Fill our home with joy tonight.

2.
When our hands were weak and helpless,
  All our weakness you supplied,
When our tiny feet did falter
  You our feeble steps did guide.
When the heavy hand of sickness,
  Took our strength and laid us low:
You with all a mother’s fondness
  Soothed and cooled each fever’d brow.

3.
What were home without you Mother,
  But a sad and dreary place;
May the day be very distant
  When we miss your loving face.
And when time at last shall claim you,
  And we miss your care and love,
May we gather round you Mother
  In the better home above.

4.
Other faces we remember,
  Gathered with us long ago,
Some have gone, we know not whither,
  Some are with the Angels now.
Happy faces round you Mother,
  Gather in the cheery light,
Merry songs from happy voices
  Fill our homw with Glee tonight.
