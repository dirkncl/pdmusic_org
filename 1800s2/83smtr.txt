1. Sing me to sleep with a soft Lullaby.
Sorrow will vanish when e’er thou are nigh,
Smooth down my pillow then calmly I’ll rest,
Like birds that lie in their snug little nest.
Tell me once more of the angles of grace.
Bid me goodnight with a smile on your face
Breathe soft a pray’r for my safety tonight.
Then sweetly I’ll sleep ’till morn’s early light.
Then sweetly I’ll sleep, ’till morn’s early light.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Kiss me goodnight, sing me to sleep,
While angels o’er me their loving watch keep.
Dreaming of visions so pure and so bright,
Break not my slumbers ’till morn’s early light.
Break not my slumbers ’till morn’s early light.

2. Sing me to sleep for the night’s coming on.
The shadows are deep’ning the sunlight is gone.
The streamlet of life is fleeting away,
And the morning is dawning of a bright happy day.
In the garden no more the roses I’ll see.
The music of angels hath more charms for me
Dry away those sad tears, o’er me to not weep,
Kiss me goodnight sing me to sleep.
Kiss me goodnight, O sing me to sleep.
