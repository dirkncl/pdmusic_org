1. The very greatest joy I vow,
  When the day is warm and mild,
Is dressing and then out to go,
  A shopping for a while,
You meet the people every where,
  of every kind and grade;
Some old and ugly, others fair,
  Some happy others sad.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
It’s nice to go a shopping
If you only have the cash.
Into all the stores apopping,
and cutting quite a dash:
Into all the stores apopping—
And cutting quite a dash.

2. They ask for this, and ask for that,
  The clerks turn here and there;
And some with others laugh and chat
  Gossip, sneer and slander:
Two yards of that! the price of this,
  Comes from every quarter;
And, give me twenty yards of Swiss,
  Send it by your Porter!

3. That’s not the way I do shop,
  Oh, no, indeed, it’s not;
Into a Store I like to drop
  Where nice Clerks there’s a lot;
They look so clean, and dress so nice,
  And talk about the style;
And when I ask them of the price,
  They blush, and then they smile.

4. The pretty girls they wait upon,
  The ugly have to stand;
And while the old they try and shun,
  The young they can’t withstand.
So when into a store I go
  They make a rush for me,
Because I’m pretty, that I know,
  Is why they “go for me.”

5. But one of them’s in love with me,
  And I’m in love with him;
To be his wife, I did agree,
  If he’d some money— win:
My darling’s name’s Timotheus Widdle,
  Just twenty years of age;
He parts his hair in the middle,
  And in style is all the rage.
