1. ’Tis long since you whispered my name, Annie dear,
As we stood by the starlighted sea,
And dreamed that the future would happily bring,
Sweet blessings to you and to me.
But, ah! the prized years were all darkened with tears;
Our joydreams forever, forever are o’er;
For the angels have claimed thee a sister above,
And I watch for thy coming, for thy coming no more. 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I hear her sweet voice in the wandering breeze,
I know she is calling to me, she is calling to me
Down by the whispering, whispering sea
I know she is calling to me,
Down by the whispering, whispering sea
 down by the whispering sea.

2. Now silent and lone when the daylight is gone,
I roam on the starlighted beach,
And sigh for the day that forever have flown,
And the love that is out of my reach.
I long for the light of your smile, Annie dear,
The smile that was heaven, yes heaven to me;
But you’re far from my sight while I’m weeping tonight,
Down, down by the whispering, by the whispering sea.

3. Look down solemn stars with your pitying eyes!
No longer she walks with me here;
But often when twilight has shrouded the skies,
I feel that her spirit is near.
I hear her sweet voice in the wandering breeze,
I know she is calling, yes calling to me;
And my lips breathe the vows that together we made,
Down, down by the whispering, by the whispering sea
