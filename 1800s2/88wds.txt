1. De old place on de Chespeake Bay 
Is in my heart to night, 
I hopes to git back d’yar some day 
An’ hongers for de sight, 
Dee some ’an’ tole me I was free, 
An’ all my work was done; 
I left dem whar was good to me, 
An’ now I’se all alone.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
De name ob ole Virginia 
Is sweet as rain in drouf, 
Oh! Master, say, has you been dy’ar? 
Hits way down in de Souf. 

CHORUS [sung after, or instead of, each REFRAIN]
De name ob ole Virginia, 
Is sweet as rain in drouf; 
Oh! Master, say, has you been dy’ar? 
Hits way down in de Souf.

2. De grass dat grows ’pon top de hill 
De ones I love does hide, 
I pray de Lord to spyah me still 
To sleep dar by dee side, 
De ole plantation’s sole an’ all, 
But some time dee will come, 
An’ I will hear Brer Gabrul call, 
To fetch de ole man home.
