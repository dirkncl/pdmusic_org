1.
A highland laddie there lived o'er the way,
A laddie both noble and gallant and gay,
Who loved a lassie as noble as he,
A bonnie sweet lassie, the maid o' Dundee,
This lassie had lands, but the laddie had nane,
And yet to her it was all the same,
For dearly she loved him and said she knew,
This laddie, dear laddie was gude and true.

2.
E'er years or even months had fled,
This laddie and lassie were happily wed;
Nae better wifey e'er lived on the lea,
Than "Bonnie sweet Bessie, the maid o' Dundee,"
A happier hame nae mon ever had
Than this which held two hearts sae glad,
And ne'er did Bessie have cause to rue,
Her wedding this laddie, sae gude and true.

3.
But sorrow came to her heart one day,
And her dear darlin' was taken away,
Then oh how sad and lone was she,
Poor "Bonnie sweet Bessie, the maid o' Dundee,"
And when in the ground her darlin' they laid,
Her heart then broke, and she fervently prayed,
"Oh God in heaven let me go too"
And be wi' my laddie, sae gud and true.
