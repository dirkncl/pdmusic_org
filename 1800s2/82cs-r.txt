1. Why don’t you sleep my ba by, 
And dream of the angels bright! 
I’ll rock rockaby the cradle, 
So sleep ’till the morning light! 
Tho’ I am poor and lowly, 
You shall be rich some day. 
For you belong to hea ven! 
Yes, that’s what the angels say! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Lullaby, lullaby, 
Lullaby, lulluby. 
Yes, it is an angel hov’ring nigh! 
Lullaby, lullaby, 
Go to sleep my baby! 

2. Now you are dreaming, baby, 
I wonder  what you see! 
I hope it is something better, 
Than this humble place can be! 
Now you are smi ling, baby; 
Yes, it is something fine! 
Something so sweet and lovely, 
For this little babe of mine!
