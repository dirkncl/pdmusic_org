1. 
[Uncle Dan]
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan. 
We are poor, but we’re honest and true. 
Of sorrows we’ve had our share. 
But of riches we never knew. 
[Aunt Peggy]
We’ve buried our children almost alone. 
For poverty’s friends are few. 
We’ve tried to live best we can, 
[BOTH]
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow low 
And the worst ill may come now that can 
We’ll stick together while life shall last, 
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan. 
Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low, 
And the worst ills may come now that can 
We’ll stick together while life shall last, 
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan.

2. 
[Uncle Dan]
Oh Peggy how sad the day 
When we buried our old est boy. 
It seem’d that your heart would break 
And life for you’d lost all joy. 
[Aunt Peggy]
Oh Daniel your heart it was brave and free. 
Your faith in the future strong. 
We’ve liv’d thro’ it best we can, 
[BOTH]
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan.

3. 
[Uncle Dan]
We’ve struggled together hard 
For to bring up our children when young. 
And many a hope we’ve had 
As their lullaby songs we sung. 
[Aunt Peggy]
The angel of death came and took them all. 
And left us without a child. 
We’ve done just the best we can, 
[BOTH]
Aunt Peggy and Uncle Dan.
