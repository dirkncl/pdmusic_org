1. The good ship went sailing from the town,
And friends said farewell to dear ones all;
And she sailed while the winter sun went down,
And darkness came round her like a pall.
Little childred in the cabings were so happy at their play,
Mothers dear, and fathers, too, were there that night;
But, oh! those darling ones were doomed to die,
When the City of Columbus sank from sight!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The night was dark and cold, and the storm was raging wild,
The fierce breakers dashed upon the shore! (on the shore!)
The good ship wen down beneath the wave, (beneath the wave)
The City of Columbus sails no more, no more!
Farewell! farewell! farewell!

2. Oh, sad were the friends at home that day,
When news of the wreck came back to town;
There was weeping for parent and for child,
For brothers and sisters that went down.
When the lifeboats bravely ventured to thy dying ones at sea,
To the frozen ones who ne’er would reach the shore,
There was little for a human hand to do—
The City of Columbus was no more!

3. For those who have lost their kindred dear,
A sigh comes from ev’ry loving heart,
And we think of the homes made cheerless now,
When forced from the loving ones to part.
Heaven help each noble ship that sails the dark and stormy sea,
Heaven bless each man who saved a life that day!
We can ne’er forget that dark and gloomy time,
When the City of Columbus passed away!
