1. Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then. 
Bow’d low with her threescore years and ten; 
Bravest of all in Fred’rick town, 
She took up the banner the men  haul’d down; 
In her attic window the staff she set, 
To show that one was loyal yet 
In her attic window the staff she set. 
To show that one heart was loyal yet. 
Up the street came the rebel tread. 
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead; 
Under his slouch’d hat left and right 
He glanc’d the old flag met his sight. 
“Halt!” the dustbrown ranks stand fast. 
“Fire!” outblaz’d the rifle blast. 
It shiver’d the windowpane and sash. 
It rent the banner with seam and gash. 
Quick, as it fell from the broken staff, 
Dame Barbara snatch’d the silken scarf. 
She lean’d far out of the window sill, 
And shook it forth with a royal will. 
“Shoot, if you must, this! old grey head, 
Shout, if you must, this old grey head, 
“But spare your country’s flag,” she said, 
“But spare your country’s flag,” she said. 

2. A shade of sadness, a blush of shame, 
Over the face of the leader came; 
The noble nature within him, stirr’d 
To life at this woman’s deed and word. 
“Who touches a hair of yon grey head, 
“Who touches a har of yon grey head, 
Dies like a dog, dies like a dog, march on.” he said. 
All day long through Fredrick street, 
Sounded the tramp of marching feet; 
All day long that free flag toss’d 
Over the heads of the rebel host. 
And through the hillgaps sunset light 
Shone o’er it with a warm goodnight! 
Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er, 
And the rebel rides on his raid no more! 
Honer to her, and let a tear 
Fall for her sake on Stonewall’s bier. 
Honor to her, and let a tear 
Fall for her sake on Stonewall’s bier.
