1. Thy love is always near to me,
Tho’ thou art far away;
It is a beacon bright and fair
To cheer me on my way;
It ia a star to guide me tho’
This busy world of pain,
A beacon bright to rest with me
Until we meet again.

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Thy face is always near to me,
Tho’ thou art far away,
It is a beacon bright and fair
To cheer me on my way.

2. The vision bringingeth me fond hopes
Of better days in store,
It whispers of a time to come
When we shall part no more;
Then rest with me Oh vision bright,
My only hope, thou art,
My only joy, My only grief
Is when we are apart.

3. They face, ah, me! ’tis always near,
’Tis never from my sight,
It haunts me thro’ each long, long day,
And fills my dreams at night;
And yet it is a source of joy,
It is my heart’s great wealth,
And only would I Lose it for
The vision’s own dear self.
