1.
Little empty cradle, treasured now with care,
Though thy prescious burden it has fled.
How ee miss the locks of curly golden hair,
Peeping from the tiny snowwhite bed,
When the dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes
From the rumpled pillow shone.
Then I gazed with gladness,
Now I look and sigh;
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Baby left her cradle
For the golden shore,
(For the silv'rey waters she has flown, (has flown,)
Gone to join the angels peaceful evermore!
Empty cradle, Baby's gone.

2.
Near a shady valley standa a grassy mound,
Underneath my little darling sleeps.
Blossoms sweet, and roses cluster all around;
Overhead the willow silent weeps.
There I laid my loved one in the long ago,
And my heart doth really mourn.
Though she's with the angels,
Still I fain would weep;
Empty is the cradle, Baby's gone.
