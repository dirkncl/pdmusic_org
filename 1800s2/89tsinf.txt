1. I’ve list’ned to sweet music, voluptuous and grand, 
I’ve list’ned to the melodies of ev’ry foreign land: 
And many, many songs I’ve sung, of praise, of chivalry, 
And songs of love, and songs of war, but never can it be, 
That I’ll forget one old, old strain, within my heart so deep. 
The song my mother used to sing, to rock her babe to sleep: 

[REFRAIN]
Hush my dear, lie still and slumber, 
Holy angels, guard thy bed; 

2. ’Twas not so much the music, as ’twas the tender tune, 
That made me pause and listen, When often, all alone, 
With mother dear and baby, so quiet would I keep, 
While list’ning to that mother’s voice, singing her child to sleep, 
And now, though years have passed since then, It’s echo lingers yet, 
The song my mother used to sing, I never can forget. 

[REFRAIN]
Hush my  dear, lie still and slumber, 
Holy angels, guard thy bed:

CHORUS
It’s echo lingers yet, 
The song I’ll ne’er forget, 
The song my mother used to sing, 
The song I’ll ne’er forget.
