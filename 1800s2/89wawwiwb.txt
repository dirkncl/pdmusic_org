1. If we could imagine this world full of peace, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If troubles and trials and quarrels should cease, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If we all could get wives without temper or flaw, 
Who  would not give us, club nights, so much of their jaw; 
If we never had dread of our mothersinlay 
What a wonderful world it would be! be!

CHORUS 1
What a wonderful world it would be, my boys, 
What a marvelous world it would be, 
If the mothers of wives would but sweeten our lives, 
What a wonderful world it would be!

2. If girls had their fancy for eating ice cream, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If birds and if bustles were just as they seem, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If the ladies in street cars, which one daily meets
 Would lad offer the gentlemen standing, their seats, 
In a tone and a style which acceptance entreats, 
What a wonderful world it would be! be!

CHORUS 2
What a wonderful world it would be, my boys, 
What a marvelous world it would be, 
If the girls smoked cigars on the front of the cars, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 

3. If streets of New York were respectably clean, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If Aldermen were not in Canada seen, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If that sort of office which seeks and the man 
Would insure he was built upon honesty’s plan, 
Or place him immediately under the ban, 
What a wonderful world it would be! be!

CHORUS 3
What a wonderful world it would be, my boys, 
What a marvelous world it would be, 
If we knew a man’s faults are with boodle he’d waltz, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 

4. If boarding house keepers would buy better meal 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If their chickens were ill for a mortal to eat, 
What a wonderful world it would be! 
If there butter was weaker, their suffer more strong, 
If the hack wasn’t always deridedly wrong, 
If they didn’t put mail where it doesn’t belong, 
What a wonderful world it would be! be!

CHORUS 4
What a wonderful world it would be, my boys, 
What a marvelous world would be, 
If their eggs wre not stale as the jokes told at Yule, 
What a wonderful world it would be!
