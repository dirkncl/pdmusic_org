1. Rest, Soldier, rest, thy labor is done,
The battle is fought and the victory won!
Fought thou for freedom, fought thou for right;
Rest, soldier, rest, in heaven so bright,
Call it not death for he sleepeth,
His soul holds communion with God.
Peace be to thee, thy mem’ry is blest;
Died thou for freedom, then rest, soldier rest.
2. Bravely he fought his country to save,
And now he has fallen, forget no the brave,
Dear was the  comrade that stood by our side;
Rest, soldier, rest, for freedom you died,
Nations will mourn thee for ever,
The stars and the stripes o’er thee wave.
Poor fallen brave, with honor is blest;
Died thou for freedom, then rest, soldier rest.

3. Peace be to him that sleeps in his grave,
Who left home and dear friends his country to save;
Long may the flag float o’er Freedom’s sod;
Rest, soldier, rest, in peace with thy God,
No more the bugle will call him;
He’s pass’d through the shadow of death.
Rest soldier ret, thy labor is done;
Freedom for ever thy rest, soldier rest.

Rest, soldier rest, Rest, soldier rest.
