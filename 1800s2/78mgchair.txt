1. I’m sitting today in my grandmother’s chair, 
And dreaming of childhood’s bright happy days; 
I  still see her face with its wrinkles of care, 
I still hear her sweet words of praise. 
The church bell swinging to and fro, 
I hear in my dreaming today; 
Though long years have passed since I heeded the call, 
And grandmother sleeps far away! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[1ST verse]
It tells me a story, 
[2ND verse]
How dearly I love it,
[BOTH verses]
that old-fashioned chair! 
It whispers, “We’re passing away.” 
My grandmother’s chair, 
My grandmother’s chair,
It tells of her today (speaks today). 

2. The old Book she loved, as it lay in her lap,
Her comfort and shield in life’s closing years;
I see now the gray head, the white ruffled cap,
Bent low, just to hide grateful tears!
And now I’m rocking to and fro,
With dear little ones on my knee;
I tell them the stories of long, long ago,
That grandmother once told to me!
