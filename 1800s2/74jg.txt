1.
Open the window, mother,
And let me breathe again
The sweet breath of the morning,
It cools my fever'd brain.
I think I have been dreaming,
So many things I've seen,
But, O, the brightest of them
Was little Jessie Green.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Mother, I have been dreaming,
So many things I've seen
And heard such heav'nly music
From little Jessie Green.

2.
She seem'd to come before me,
I saw her snowy dress,
But then I knew it could not be,
I felt not her caress,
We laid her in the churchyard,
And sadly from the scene
We turn'd our footsteps homeward,
And left poor Jessie Green.

3.
O, will she never waken?
I long to hear her sing,
So like the little birdies
That come to us in spring;
I often wish she were a bird,
So sweet her songs have been.
No sweeter have I ever heard,
Than those of Jessie Green.
