1.
Underneath the gaslight's glitter,
Stands a little fragile girl,
Heedless of the nightwinds bitter,
As they 'round about her whirl,
While the hundreds pass unheading,
In the evening's waning hours,
Still she cries with tearful pleading,
Wont you buy me pretty flow'rs?

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
There are many sad and weary,
In this pleasant world of ours,
Crying ev[']ry night so dreary,
Wont you buy my pretty flow'rs?

2.
Ever coming, ever going,
Men and woman hurry by,
Needless of the teardrops gleaming,
In her sad and wistful eye,
How her little heart is sighing,
In the cold and dreary hours,
Only listen to her crying,
Wont you buy my pretty flow'rs?

3.
Not a loving word to cheer her,
From the passers by is heard,
Not a friend to liner nearer,
With a heart by pity stirred,
Howmeward goes the tide of fashion,
Seeking pleasure's pleasant bow'rs,
None to hear with sad compassion,
Wont you buy my pretty flow'rs?
