1. Only the soldiers brave and true,
Who wore the coats of grey and blue,
Can tell us how they spent their time,
Along the “picket line.”

As told to me, I’ll tell in rhyme,
How ’tis said they spent their time;
They’d shoot awhile, and then would cease,—
“Pray for the glorious dawn of peace.”

[Spoken after 1st verse.--]
When they wished to cease "firing," and be "friends" for a while,
you would hear them call to each other--

Halloo, Johnny!— Halloo, Yank!
Will you stop your “firing” now,
Come and take a drink?
Then down they’d go, and meet half way,
And this is what they’d do, “they say:”
They’d trade jackknives and papers too;
These “Johnnies grey“ and “Yankees blue.”

CHORUS 1-5.
O, only the soldiers, brave and true,
Who wore the coats of “grey” and “blue,”
Can tell us how they spent their time,
Along the “picket line.”

2. The “Johnnies grey” tobacco grew,
Little had the “Yankees blue.”
But coffee plenty had— “they say:”—
None at all had “Johnnies grey.”

[Irish broque.]*
*[Spoken after 2d verse.--]
When they wished to cease "firing," and exchange 
their "coffee" for "tobacco," you'd hear "Pat" call out--

Hiloo, Johnny!— Halloo, Yank!
Sure, won’t ye have off “firr’n” now,
Come and take a drink?
Then “Pat” would down to Johnny go,
And coffee give for tobacco.
They’d trade jackknives and papers too;
These “Johnnies grey“ and “Yankees blue.”

3. Thro’ all the long, long, dreary night,
To signal the approaching fight,
With stealthy tread their “vigils keep.”
Sure death to him who dares to sleep!

[Dutch brogue.]*
*[Spoken after 3d verse.-- Weary of watching thro' the long dreary night,
you would hear "Hans Brightman" (in the morning) call--

Haillow, Shonny!— Halloo, Yank!
Vill yu me now no more schoot,
Cum und dake a trink?
Then down they’d go, and meet half way,
And this is what they’d do, “they say:”
They’d trade jackknives and papers too;
These “Johnnies grey“ and “Yankees blue.”

4. As each unto his post would go,
Resume the attitude of foe,
Then words like these, take care! take care!—
Told each of danger to beware!

[Spoken after 4th verse.-- But when they wished to cease "firing"
and again be "friends," you'd hear--

Halloo, Johnny!— Halloo, Yank!
Will you stop your “firing” now,
Come and take a drink?
Then down they’d go and meet half way,
And this is what they’d do, “they say:”
They’d trade jackknives and papers too;
These “Johnnies grey“ and “Yankees blue.”

5. But now the glorious dawn of peace,
Has bid all strife and discord cease,
No “picket line” have we today,
No “Yanks or Johnnies grey.”
No North, no Sourth, no East, no West,
But all united we love best;
One Flag, one country. Liberty,
Our motto now and e’er shall be.
