1. The Elephant danc’d on a Crocodile’s back. 
Gobbler he wink’d at the Railroad track. 
The Jaybird died on a Jew’s harp and fiddle. 
Nipper and Gadfly hey! diddle diddle!

CHORUS 1
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz! 
Buz away Mosquito! 
Buz! Buz! Buz! 
Oh! Adam scull’d up the old Pedee 
Buz away Mosquito 
But don’t Buz me.

2. Old King Cole sat, mis Hallelujah “Bose”. 
Flippetty Jack had hold of his toes. 
“Six room rouse” the Boatblacks pat. 
Hit him a rap on top of his hat.

CHORUS 2
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz! 
Buz away Mosquito! 
Buz! Buz! Buz! 
Big jig jig git a way old dad 
Buz away Mosquito 
Buz ’em all mad.

3. The Owlingale hopp’d square over the moon.
Fly away Treetoad, Clarabella’s tune.
The Pollywog sung about Old Dog Tray.
Captain Jink’s horse cars every other day.

CHORUS 3
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz!
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz!
Jim Crow he went hopity scratch
Buz away Mosquito!
You’re hard to match.

4. Grasshopper walk’d in a dining bell
Up in a balloon and down he fell.
Little dog cried when he wagged his tail.
Old Zip Coon riding on a rail.

CHORUS 4
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz!
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz! Buz! Buz!
Ringtailed monkey with a red head
Buz away Mosquito!
Buz ’em all dead.
