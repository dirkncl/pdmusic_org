1. She sat in the old arm chair
And sewed a dainty quilt
An odd and checkered beauty
Was that dear little patchwork quilt
She christened the bright patches
She gave them our Sur names
The children gathered around her
and felt proudly of their names

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We prize with secret pleasure secret pleasure
That little dainty checkered quilt
and ever eever dear as a family treasure
Is this Grandmothers patchwork quilt

2. To sew that patchwork quilt
Was a pleasure not a duty
For when it was completed
It proved to be a checkered beauty
Though years since then have passed
Time has not changed that quilt
Bright are the Rainbow colors
of our Grandmothers patchwork quilt
