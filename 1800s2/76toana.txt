PROLOGUE.
A-wake, each free-born patriot son,
M-ake now thy cordon, blend as one,
E-stranged not still, with wars reflects,
R-evel with rapture, each regrets,
I-llustrate thy incorporate weal,
C-an discord stll thy bosom feel,
A-nd yet utopian ire abound,
S-hall this our country's second birth
R-egarded be with authgt but mirth?
E-nthral each premature thought's flight,
Q-uote nought but for our mutural might,
U-nshackle nought but which can bring
E-ach memory back on joyous wing.
S-end sweet vibrations ne'er to fade,
T-hat is to a grateful country made.
---
As a cordon to cement and never server,
We now clasp hands united and forever,
We now proclaim throughout the land,
To all our great united band,
With God's permission yet to sing,
Still let Centennial echoes ring.

VERSE
1. Shine you brightest, ye stars,
  A full luminous ray;
Our Centennial proclaims,
  Heaven’s mission today
Smile now all ye nations
  Of earthly renown,
All hail to Columbia’s
  Mature, visioned crown.

CHOROS [sung after each VERSE]
As adverse minds no longer doubt,
  Let the echoes ring afar
As a thunder bolt from Heaven
  In a meteorlike star,
Let this universal grand display.
  Your feelings not to mar,
As the triumph of a nation’s age
  By Philadelphia!

2. As the trumpet from Heaven,
  The dead shall awake.
Our Centennial proclaims
  Thee America, great;
Monumental to history,
  What greater can be,
Than a peaceful obelisk,
  In this land of the free. 

3. When unmatured and small,
  Did our country creep,
Thank our God for it all,
  She has now found her feet:
Revolution’s dark days,
  For a time us did mar,
More glad tidings are these,
  Than a triumph by war.

4. We the nations invite,
  Competition to all,
Our intention’s not strife,
  Will you come at our call?
To the stranger the right hand
  Of friendship we give,
As a brother we’ll care for you,
  As long as you live.

5. Fondest hope of bright future,
  May it never decay,
On this earth where all creatures
  Are destined to stay,
Let us hence coincide
  With humanity’s claims,
Live in peace to enjoy,
  All our heavenly gains

6. As the rays from the sun,
  In the glory of day:
There’s an absent one foremost,
  In fond memory,
Be it never forgotten,
  This nation began,
By our father first President,
  George Washington.

7. As a tribute to each,
  Who has followed thy wake,
And has premier reached,
  In our country’s debate,
Quote we Jefferson, Franklin,
  And many likewise,
Oh! a requiem take,
  Be it heard in the skies.

8. Oh! illustriious one yet,
  Though we mention thee last,
Yet not least thy impress
  In America’s cast,
Thy cenotaph still in our
  Bosom swell yet,
Be thy name ever living,
  Valorous Lafayette.
