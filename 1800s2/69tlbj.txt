"The Little Brown Jug" (1869)
by Joseph Eastburn Winner, 1837-1918
(aka "Eastburn")

1.
My wife and I lived all alone,
  In a little log hut we called our own;
She loved gin, and I loved rum,--
  I tell you what, we'd lots of fun.

CHORUS
Ha, ha, ha, you and me,
  "Little brown jug" don't I love thee;
Ha, ha, ha, you and me,
  "Little brown jug" don't I love thee.

2.
'Tis you who makes my friends my foes,
'Tis you who makes me wear old clothes;
Here you are, so near my nose,
So tip her up and down she goes.

(CHORUS)

3.
When I go toiling to my farm,
  I take little "Brown Jug" under my arm;
I place it under a shady tree,
  Little "Brown Jug" 'tis you and me.

(CHORUS)

4.
If all the folks in Adam's race,
  Were gathered together in one place;
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear,
  Before I'll part from you, my dear.

(CHORUS)

5.
If I'd a cow that gave such milk,
  I'd clothe her in the finest silk;
I'd feed her on the choicest hay,
  And milk her forty times a day.

(CHORUS)

6.
The rose is red, my nose is, too,
  The violet's blue, and so are you;
And yet I guess before I stop,
  We'd better take another drop.

(CHORUS)
