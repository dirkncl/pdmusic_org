1. With song and laughter so merry, 
With lips that rival the cherry, 
Charming little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks, 
Precious jewel, Goldilocks, Grandpa’s darling. 

Bright curls that ever are streaming 
Wheree’er the sunshine is gleaming, 
Winsome little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks, 
Laughter-loving Goldilocks— Grandpa’s darling.

2. Dear eyes such gladness revealing,
Sweet lips such wisdom concealing,
Witching little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks,
Wonder finding Goldilocks, Grandpa’s darling.

Wee feet o’er dewy grass flying,
To some new mischief e’er lieing,
Busy little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks,
Fairy-footed Goldilocks— Grandpa’s darling.

3. New words so timid essaying,
Great depths of loving betraying;
Gifted little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks,
Kindly hearted Goldilocks, Grandpa’s darling.

Wee hands so tender caressing,
True heart that proveth a blessing,
Truthful little Goldilocks, Goldilocks, Goldilocks,
Eager-learning Goldilocks— Grandpa’s darling.
