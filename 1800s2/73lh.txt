1.
I would not live them o’er again,
Those mary weary hours,
Thro’ which I waited long in vain,
In love deserted bowers;
Where I have watch’d the dial’s hand,
In sunshine and in gloom,
Still faintly struggling to withstand
My all too certain doom!
My all to certain doom!
Where I have watch’d the dial’s hand
In sunshine and in gloom,
Still faintly struggling to withstand,
Still faintly struggling to withstand
My all, my all, my all too certain doom.

2.
I could not live them o’er again,
They would my bosom rend,
Nor long support the sick’ning pain
With which I can’t contend;
I will no more endure the smart,
In bearing which I erred—
Of that dull sinking of the heart
That follows hope defer’d!
That follows hope defer’d!
I will no more endure the smart
In bearing which I err’—
Of that dull sinking of the heart,
Of that dull sinking of the heart
That follows, that follows,
that follows hope defer’d.

3.
Oft did I vainly watch for one
Who took no thought of me,
And grieve to find myself alone
Upon life’s troubled sea;
Nor will I watch and wait no more—
From care I will be free,
Until I reach that silent shore,
Where angels wait for me!
Where angels wait for me!
Nor will I watch and wait no more—
From care I will be free,
Untill I reach that silent shore,
Until I reach that silent shore
Where angels, where angels,
where angels wait for me.
