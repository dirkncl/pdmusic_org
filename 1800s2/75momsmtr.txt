1. Mother! oh Mother! sing me to rest,
  As in my bright days departed.
  Sing to thy child, the sickhearted,
Song’s for a spirit, a spirit oppress’d,
  Song’s for a spirit, a spirit oppressed.

2. Lay this tired head on thy breast!
  Flowers from the nightdew are closing,
  Pilgrims and mourners reposing,
Mother! oh, sing me, oh, sing me to rest,
  Mother! oh, sing me, sing me to rest.

3. Take! oh, take back thy bird to its nest!
  Weary is young life when blighted,
  Heavy this love unrequited;
Mother! oh, sing me, oh, sing me to rest.
  Mother! oh, sing me, sing me to rest.
