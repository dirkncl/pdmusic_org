1.
There’s and emblem so dear to American hearts,
Floating over the land that is free,
Since the Goddess of Liberty’s cradle was rocked
On the shores of the isle of the sea.
With a dark field of blue and a bright stripe of red,
Bespangled with stars bright as gold,—
A Centennial present
From brave hearts now still,—
This “banner a hundred years old.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
God bless our Centennial meeting at home!
May joys and sweet pleasures untold,
Cluster round the dear emblem our forefathers gave—
This “banner a hundred years old.

2.
And when Liberty, crushed by the gim tyrant’s hand,
Lay panting and bleeding alone,
Ere the brave hearts had rallied around our dear land,
And had offer’d their blood to atone.
And the Angel of love, looking down from above,
Dropped tears on the blue ocean cold,
And plashing that flag,
They enfigured each star
On this “banner a hundred years old.”
