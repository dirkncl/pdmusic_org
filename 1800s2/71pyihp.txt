1. It’s a very good rule in, all things in life, 
When judging a friend or a brother, 
Not to look at the question alone on one side, 
But always to turn to the other. 
We are apt to be selfish in all our views, 
In the jostling headlong race. 
And so to be right, ere you censure a man, 
Just “put yourself in  his place.”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Just put yourself in his place. 
Yes, put yourself in his place. 
And so to be right ere you censure a man, 
Just put yourself in his place.

2. It is verry hard to be just to know 
The reason another may give, 
How much he has struggled and fought and striven, 
How honestly tried to live; 
How much been cheated, how sorely tried, 
Ere the wrong he was forc’d to embrace, 
And if you would earn these things, the way 
Is to “put yourself in his place.”

3. There’s many a man crush’d down by shame, 
Who blameless stands before God. 
But whom his fellows have utterly scorn’d, 
And made to pass under the rod, 
Whose soule is unstain’d by thought of sin, 
Who will yet fing saving grace 
And who would be prais’d where you now condemn 
If you’d “put yourself in his place.”
