1. 
I’m thinking of the olden time, 
When I was but a boy; 
My life then seem’d a flow’ry path, 
My heart was full of joy; 
Of the dear old swing down in the lane, 
That used to go on high; 
In which the boys and girls would play 
At “:Letting the old cat die!”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! then I was so happy, 
But now there comes a sigh, 
To think I’ll never play again 
At “Letting the old cat die!”

2. 
We often went, with merry shout, 
As soon as school was done, 
A joyous happy little hand, 
Oh, it was royal fun; 
The brighteyed girls we used to swing, 
Until they’d gaily cry, 
“Just send us up among the leaves, 
Then “Let the old cat die!”

3. 
Where are those merry children now? 
Where is the dear old swing? 
Ah! years have chang’d that happy scene, 
No more their voices ring; 
They’re gone and I am left alone, 
But as the years roll by, 
I can’t forget the fun we had, 
“Letting the old cat die!”
