[1.]
Falling leaf, and fading tree,
Lines of white in a sullen sea,
Shadows rising on you and me;
shadows rising on you and me;
The swallows are making them ready to fly,
Wheeling out on a windy sky.
Good-bye, Summer!
Good-bye, Good-bye!
Good-bye! summer!
Good-bye, Good-bye!

[2.]
Hush! A voice from faraway!
"Listen and learn," it seems to say,
"All the tomorrows shall be as today."
"All the tomorrows shall be as today."
The cord is frayed -- the cruse is dry,
The link must break, and the lamp must die.
Good-bye, to Hope!
Good-bye, Good-bye!
Good-bye, to Hope!
Goodbye, Good-bye!

[CHORUS]
What are we waiting for?
Oh! my heart!
Kiss me straight on the brow!
And part! Again!
Again! Again! my heart! my heart!
What are we waiting for you and I?
A pleading look -- a stifled cry.
Good-bye, for ever!
Good-bye, for ever!
Good-bye,
Good-bye, Good-bye!
