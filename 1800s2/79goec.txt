1. The old easy chair by the window does sit,
As it did in the years that have gone,
It looks as it did when together we met
To sing when our labor was done;
’Twas in this old chair that grandma would rest,
At eve, from the toils of the day,
Of all in the house she liked it the best,
’Twas her joy as she grew old and gray. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The old easy chair, it stays by us yet,
And it stands in its old corner there,
And dearly we love it, we ne’er can forget
Our grandmother’s old easy chair.

2. The door is all worn where it rocked to and fro,
For ’twas used ev’ry day in the week;
And when grandmother died the old chair seemed to know,
When ’twas used its old rockers would creak;
And not once, since that day when we laid her to rest,
Has it folded a form in its arms;
But it seems to us all the most hallow’d and blest
Of the homestead and all of its charms.

3. It was given to her on the day she was wed,
And ’twas always her joy and her pride,
And when to her home as a bride she was led,
The old chair was placed by her side;
But its cushions are faded that once were so bright,
It no longer is strong, as that day,
’Twill not stand very long in the old window light,
For ’tis steadily passing away.
