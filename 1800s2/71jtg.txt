1.
Soprano SOLO
Jerusalem the golden, 
With milk and honey blest, 
Beneath thy contemplation, 
Sink heart and voice oppress’d.
DUETT [Soprano and Alto]
I know not, Oh I know not, 
What social joys are there, 
What radiancy of glory, 
What light beyond compare,
QUARTETT [SATB]
And when I fain would sing them, 
My spirit falls and faints, 
And vainly would it image, 
The assemble of the saints, 
They stand, those walls of Zion, 
Conjubilant with song, 
And bright with many an angel, 
And all the martyr throng.

2.
Soprano SOLO
There is the throne of David, 
And there from care released, 
The song of them that triumph, 
The shout of them that feast, 
DUETT [Soprano and Alto]
And they who with their leader, 
Have conquer’d in the fight, 
Forever and forever, 
Are clad in robes of white,
QUARTETT [SATB]
Oh, sweet and blessed country!
The home of God’s elect!
Oh, sweet and blessed country, 
That eager hearts expect, 
Jesus, in mercy bring us, 
To that dear land of rest;
Who art with God the Father, 
And spirit ever blest.
