1.
Daughters of freedom arise in your might!
March to the watchwords Justice and Right!
Why will ye slumber? wake, O wake!
Lo! on your legions light doth break!

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Sunder the fetters “custom” hath made!
Come from the valley, hill and glade!

2.
Daughters of freedom, the truth marches on,
Yield not the battle till ye have won!
Heed not the “scorner,” day by day
Clouds of oppression roll away!

3.
Dauthters of freedom, the “Ballot” be yours,—
Wield it with wisdom, your hopes it secures.
“Rights that are e qual”— this ye claim,
Bright by your guerdon, fair your fame!
