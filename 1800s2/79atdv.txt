1. Across the dark valley to mansions of light,
One dear one— one lov’d ine has gone,
No more to wander ’mid shadows of night,
Afar from the world and its scorn,
Softly thy spirit has left its poor tomb,
And gone to the Father who gave,
A home in exchange for the sorrow and gloom,
A home for beyond the dark grave.

DUETT or QUARTETTE Ad lib. [sung after each VERSE]
Sweetly the angels are singing today
Far up in that beautiful home,
And softly the voice of our Savior doth say
Let all the weary ones come!

2. The bright eyes are clos’d ne’er to open again,
The little hands clasp’d o’r her breast,
A loving heart free from all sorrow and pain,
And weary feet now are at rest,
Calmly she’s sleeping while far up above,
The beautiful gates open wide,
And angels are singing their sweet songs of love,
To welcome her over the tide.

3. How sad were our hearts as we stood round the bed,
To say a last loving farewell,
To  kiss the wed lips e’er the spirit had fled,
How bitter the tears as they fell,
Sweet is the promise our Savior has giv’n,
To all who will trust in his love,
When through with this life he will take us to heav’n,
To meet with the dear ones above.
