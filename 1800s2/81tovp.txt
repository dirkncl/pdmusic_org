1. 
In a quiet country village, 
Not many years ago, 
Lived our dear old fam’ly pastor, 
Whose head was white as snow. 
He was loved by all his people, 
The young as well as old; 
And we used to gather near him 
To hear the words he told.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The old village pastor now is sleeping. 
He has gone to that home so far away; 
But his mem’ry will ever be near us, 
Fresh and green as the flowers of May. 
But his mem’ry will ever be near us, 
Fresh and green as the flowers of May!

2. 
In the peaceful little churchyard, 
There stands a grassy mound, 
Where the buttercups and daisies. 
With fragrance star the ground; 
And above, a noble willow, 
Within the silence weeps, 
To mark the humble little spot, 
The village pastor sleeps.

3. 
Let him rest; his work is over; 
Perhaps he’s better there, 
Where ev’rything is sunshine. 
And all the skies are fair. 
But his memory will linger, 
Though now he is at rest, 
In the hearts of those who loved him, 
Whose homes he ever blest.
