1. One April night when home returning,
I saw him first,
Our glances met;
His looks with fond affection burning,
This beating heart can ne’er forget;
And when he spoke to ancient tender,
With grace beyond the reach of art;
Ah, then I felt I must surrender
To him at once my maiden heart.

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Ah Pardon dearest lover,
If in vain I strove,
For indeed I’d rather die than lose your love,
This confession bringing
Blushes to my cheek;
Sweeter than all singing is to hear him speak.

2. He comes beneath my window nightly,
I see his form,
And I rejoice;
While countless stars are shining brightly,
I hear the tones of his dear voice;
Then we exchange food words and glances,
And fondly speak our hopes and fear;
Defying time and his mischances,
We tinge with gold the coming year.
