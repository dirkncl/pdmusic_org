1. Up with the flag! give its folds to the breeze,
Let not its beauty be furled.
Pride of the land and the gem of the seas,
Emblems of joy to the world,
Friendly hearts rejoices to see it proudly fly,
Foes beware! nor dare its beauty mar,
Ever may it wave in freedom’s hallowed sky,
Ever shine the nation’s beacon star.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then freemen up with the flag, give its folds to the breeze,
Let not its beauty be furled.
Pride of the land and the gem of the seas,
Emblem of joy to the world.

2. Up with the flag! may we never forget,
How much of blood it has cost.
Think of the tears that its colors have set.
Think of the lives that were lost,
Brothers! North and South, and East and West agree,
No discordand voices ever raise,
Standing ’neath this glorious banner of the free
May we all unite to sing its praise.
