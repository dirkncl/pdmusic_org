1. The step of our Grandma is falt’ring,
The eyes once so bright have grown dim,
And Jesus is calling her upward,
To dwell in the bright world with Him.
The hair soft and silken is whitened,
And to this aged pilgrim is given,
A face of must wonderful beauty,
Grown young in the pure light of Heaven.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
That face of most wonderful beauty,
To Grandma Our Saviour has given
Her features so wrinkled but lovely, (how lovely),
Grow young in the pure light of Heaven.

2. The form of our Grandma is wasted,
And wrinkles are deep on her brow,
The voice we all love, has grown feeble,
She speaks in a low whisper now,
And Oh! her aged footsteps are nearing
That rest, by the kind Saviour given
To pilgrims aweary like Grandma,
Grown young in the pure light of Heaven.

3. The way of dear Grandma is Heavenward.
And Jesus is close by her side,
Her features have grown like the angels,
In heart she is pure as a child;
Her eyes look beyond this dark valley
And soon the bright crown will be given
To Grandma, at Home with the Saviour,
Grown young in the pure light of Heaven.
