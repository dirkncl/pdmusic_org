1. All last night I dreamt about thee, 
All last night I thought of thee, 
All last night you dwelt around me, 
Mary, best beloved by me. 
Shining robes were wrapp’d around thee, 
Pure and spotless, white and clear, 
Oh, you look’d so like an angel, 
Mary darling, Mary dear.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
On thy leave of snowy whiteness, 
Did a single star appear, 
Shining there in softest brightness, 
Mary darling, Mary dear.

2. Unto thee I breath’d in whispers 
Dark eyed Mary art thou here, 
Came you all the way from Heaven, 
To this world so cold and drear? 
Dearest come lay on my bosom, 
Let me feel thy spirit near, 
Like a frighten’d dove you vanish’d, 
Mary darling, Mary dear.

3. Mary darling come and meet me 
In the silent midnight hours, 
With thy dark brown tresses streaming, 
Round thy neck in shining show’rs. 
Come when I am sad and lonely, 
When the world is dark and drear, 
For I feel I love thee only, 
Mary darling, Mary dear.
