["Oh! Isn't He a Tease?"]
The story of Robinson Crusoe, I’ll tell as it was told to me,
Of all the troubled that befel a lad of low degree,
Who would not go to school or mind a word his parents said;
To play the truant was his rule, a lazy life he led.

["Lancashire Lass"]
Robinson Crusoe went one day
Into the alleys and streets to play,
And met with a juvenile son of the sea,
As wild as himself, who said come with me.
Over the sea where tbe winds do blow,
(My Father’s a Captain) you shall go,
If you like, and Robinson couldn’t say no,
For a weak minded lad was he.
They had not set sail but a month or two,
When the waves rose high, and the winds they blew,
Robinson shiver’d and shook it was plain,
He wish’d himself back with his mother again.

["I Wish I Was a Fish"]
“Why did I leave my native land,”
Poor Robinson did cry,
“Upon this deck why do I stand?”
He mutter’d mournfully,
And while he mutter’d, with a shock,
The ship it roll’d about
And went to pieces on a rock,
Which made poor Cruspe shout!
I wish I was a fish, with a great big tail,
A roley poley porpoise, a lobster or a whale,
A tiny little tittlebat, I cannot swim a little,
I’m going to the bottom of the sea. Oh my!

["Robinson Crusoe"]
But just then a wave,
From a watery grave,
Did save him and pitch him on dry land,
Where sad and alone, 
He was l3eft to bemoan
His fate on a desolate Island
“Oh! why did I ever leave my land!”
He cried, as he sat us on the Island,
“Where am I to sleep,
And what am I to eat,
I shall famish and starve on the Island!”

["Up a Tree"]
I havn’t much society, there isn’t much variety
I’ve nothing for my dinner, and di tto for my tea,
have no bed to lie upon, no line my clothes to dry upon,
In face I may say candidly that I am “up a tree.”

["The Calais Packet"]
’Twould take a long time, to be telling in rhyme,
How a neat little house out of sticks he did make,
Of the sheep that he caught, and the parrot he taught,
To be talking to him just for company’s sake,
How his clothes they were tearing, by constantly wearing,
And the suit that he made would be raising a smile,
Like Brian O Lynn, of the famous sheep skin,
Though the cut was not quite in the Broadway style.

["Isabella"]
And how he made an umberella,
Like the charming Isabella,
Just to shade the worthy fellow from the burning sun.

["In Fact You Enjoy My Way"]
Crusoe remark’d to himself
As he walk’d on the Island one day,
My will, there is none to dispute,
I’m Monarch of all I survey;
When his eyes caught the print of a foot,
On the strand, as he happen’d to stay,
He shiver’d and shook in his suit
And his Majesty fainted away.

["Robinson Crusoe"]
But his parrot he came, and he call’d him by name,
Saying “whatever’s happen’d to you so,
Get up at once, you cowardly dunce,
I’m asham’d of you Robinson Crusoe!”
Oh! Poor Robinson Crusoe,
I didn’t expect it of you so,
Get up at once, you cowardly dunce,
I’m asham’d of you Robinson Crusoe!

["The Fisherman's Daughter"]
Says Crusoe what is it,
Some one’s paid a visit,
The mark of his foot I can see very plain;
I must not neglect it,
My hut I’ll protect it,
Or quite unexpected they’ll come here again.

["Paddle Your Own Canoe"]
With a look of surprise,
He open’d his eyes,
Next morning and taking a view,
He observ’d nine or ten lettle Blackamoor men,
And each Paddled his own Canoe.

["Ten Little Niggers"]
Ten little blackamoors came on shore to dine,
One ran to Crusoe and left the other nine,
Nine follow’d him at a very furious rate,
Crusoe settled one, and then there were eight,
Eight look’d astonish’d at the welcome to them given,
So he tomahawk’d another, and then there were seven
Who had quite enough at least for a day,
So mann’d their canoes and paddled away.
One little, two little, three little, four little, five little Blackamoor boys.
Six little, seven little, eight little, nine little Blackamoor boys.
One ran to Crusoe and left the other nine,
Nine follow’d him at a very furious rate,
Crusoe settled one, and then there were eight,
Eight look’d astonish’d at the welcome to them given,
So he tomahawk’d another, and then there were seven
Who had quite enough at least for a day,
So mann’d their canoes and paddled away.
One little, two little, three little, four little, five little Blackamoor boys.
Six little, seven little, eight little, nine little, ten little Blackamoor boys.

["Now Crusoe Was Kind"]
Now Crusoe was kind,
To the one left behind,
For he knew he could make him of use, so,
He dress’d him quite tidy,
And christen’d him Friday,
What a good man was Robinson Crusoe.

["Act on the Square"]
For he was fond of acting right,
Straight forward, just and fair,
And so they liv’d this Black and White
A very happy pair;
For years, until a ship in sight,
Appear’d with flowing sail,
And bore them off to their native homes;
And so that ends my tale.
The wind it was fair, boys,
The wind it was fair,
That wafted the pair, boys,
That wafted the pair.
Over the sea, boys,
And over the main,
And landed them safe in their country again.
