1. Come niggers grease yo ankles and wenches hang yo wool, 
Ransack around, get on yo duds, we ain’t got time to fool; 
Take all de little chillen and make a big carouse, 
Dars gwine to be a warmin at Clathy Johnson’s house. 
Augustus quit dat foolin dont stan dar in de middle, 
But sassha down to Jupiter’s and tale him fetch dat fiddle; 
We’ll shout dar we’ll sing dar I’se telling you de troof, 
When we go to de warmin, we’re gwine to raise de roof.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come along, Oh! chillen come along, 
and while de moon am shining bright 
We’ll take de boat and down de ribber float 
and raise dat roof tonight.

2. Oh ’scuse me Miss Sebastian yo crimps am out ob gear. 
Now shake yoself Mose Washington and shufful over here; 
Dars possums on de table and chicken in de pot. 
Wid cold bak’d coon a floatin and hoecake smokin hot. 
We’ll all go down togedder and cut de pigeon wing, 
Den leap about and kick de ar and step de banjo fling; 
De tickets am ready Wid Miss Celestial Cline, 
Den all you hackest smokejacks go get in to de line.

3. De essence and de jaha in ole Virginay style, 
While Uncle Rufe is pattin he can watch de chicken bile; 
We’ll let de little chillen jump up and dance Jim Crow, 
De quality will be dar deyre all invited she. 
Den gwt yo partners lively be ready to skip out, 
We’ll all go down to ’freshments she when Clathy gibs de shout; 
So hustle togedder And sassha to de right, 
We’ll go down to de wamin and raise de roof tonight.
