1. Come, gather ’round the standard, boys,
  As once we did before,
For our brave Ulysses battling,
  We’ll fight it out upon this line,
As in the days of yore,
  While the cannon balls were rattling.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On, boys, on to victory,
All our party cries we’ll smother;
We’re one in heart united for our noble U. S. G!
His one good term deserves another.

2. He served the Nation true and well,
  His duty he has done,
All in spite of idle slander;
  For some would seek to rob him
Of the laurels he has won,
  Worthy, brave and good commander.

3. We trusted him in days of old,
  We’ll stick to him again,
And we’ll conquer all before us,
  Then come along, ye honest hearts,
From valley, hill and plain,
  Join us in the mighty chorus.

4. Let “sore heads” grumble if they will,
  We’ll keep the ranks unbroke,
And we’ll keep Grant in the White House;
  That old wood chopper’s axe it
Cannot harm our heart of oak
  Who is Freedom’s noble lighthouse.

5. With Grant and Wilson at our head
  We’re sure to win the fight,
As we march along together;
  With “tanner” and with “cobbler”
We are rising in our might;
  Oh, there's nothing, boys, like leather.

6. Then send above a ringing cheer,
  Ulysses leads the van;
He’s our chieftain true as ever!
  And, for another four years,
Just to find a better man,
  You will search with vain endeavor.

7. So rally from the North and South
  And from the East and West,
For the Cobbler and the Tanner!
  With Freedom for our watchword
We have pledged to do our best,
  ’Neath our starrymantled banner.
