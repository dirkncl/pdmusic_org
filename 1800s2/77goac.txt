1.
An old fashion'd chair, in our kitchin has stood,
For full half a cent'ry o'er more,
It stands in the corner, where Grandfather sat
A-way from the draught of the door,
'Tis none of your fancy luxurious seats
Of velvet, fine damask, or hair;
But plain leather cushion'd unvarnished uncarv'd
'Twas my Grandfather's old Arm chair. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
What ever for me life's changes may be,
That relic I'll treasure with care:
  'Tis dear to my heart,
  And never will I part,
With my Grandfather's Old Arm Chair.

2.
The old arm chair in the summer was placed,
Outside, 'neath the old apple tree,
And Grandfather sat in the cool pleasant shade,
With paper or book on his knee,
Watching the smoke through his corncob pipe,
Ascending in wreaths through the air,
And talking with mother, who sewed at his side
As he sat in his old Arm chair. 

3.
The chair is now vacant poor Grandfather's gone,
He sleeps by dear Grandmothers side,
His end was so peacful we thought that he slept,
He sat in that chair when he died,
Then whatever changes in life I may see,
That relic I'll treasure with care;
It brings sunny mem'ries of youth back to me
My Grandfather's old Arm chair.
