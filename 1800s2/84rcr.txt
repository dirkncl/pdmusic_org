1.
Rest, comrades, reast;
Crown'd with wreathes of roses,
While quiet sleep
Each weary eyelid closes.
Slumb'ring in your tents ye lie,
While tumult passes by,
Heeding not the years that sweep
O'er your silent, peaceful sleep;
Tho' we call, ye answer not;
Life with all its cares forgot.
  Rest, comrades, rest,
  Crown'd with wreathes of roses.

2.
Rest, comrades, rest;
Crown'd with wreathes of roses,
While quiet sleep
Eac weary eyelid closes.
Will ye hear the songs we sing,
Wear the garlands that we bring?
Shall no word of praise or blame
Reach and stir your hearts again?
Still we call, but cares forgot,
Ye slumber on and answer not;
  Rest, comrades, rest,
  Crown'd with wreathes of roses.
