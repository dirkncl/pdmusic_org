1.
The rest in peace, they rest in peace unbroken;
Honor'd braves! in peace, in peace unbroken,
Glor-ious things of them are spoken;
Love and honor be their token!
Heroes, rest, rest, rest in peace!

2.
The rest in peace, no rude alarm can wake them.
Honor'd braves! they sleep, no sound can wake them.
To your hearts in mem'ry take them;
Wreathes of sweetest flowers make them!
Heroes, rest, rest, rest in peace!
