1.
De Coons am marching down de street
And dont dey look just grand.
Dey'er all in uniform today
Dey hab a big brass band.
Just hear de drums a beatin' and
de fifes and trombones play.
'Tis de coon salvation army,
Dats out in de streets today.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
'Tis de Coon's salvation army
Oh! see dem march along.
Now blow de big salvation horn
Jes blow it loud and stron.
'Tis de Coons salvation army
Jes see dem march along
Oh! blow de big salvation horn,
Now blow it loud and strong.

2.
De Coons am fallin into line
Wid hymn books all in hand.
Dey're gwine to sing an pint de way
To Canaan's happy land.
Ole uncle Jake hab got de book
He's searchin' for de text.
And when de preachin am begun,
De debbil will get vexed.

3.
De melon patch am safe to day
No Coons am dar in sight,
De chicken's dey may roost in peace
Wid in der coops tonight.
For dont you hear de soundin' drum
De fife's and trombone's play?
Oh, de coon salvation army
Am out in de street today.
