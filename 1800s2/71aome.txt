1.Oh! where, oh! where
Can all this music be?
Falling on my ear,
Floating in the air,
Or are the angels singing love to me?
’bout Miss Susie, dear,
The apple of my eye!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Oh! Susie, my darling,
I hope I never die,
That you may live forever,
The apple of my eye!
[SOLO sung after each pair of CHORUSes]
’Twas in the orchard, Susie, darling!
When no one else was nigh.
I named you then my star, and treasure,
The apple of my eye.

2. It fills my soul with joy and ecstasy,
The mem’ry is so sweet,
Of how we first did meet,
The sweetest fruit that rippens on a tree,
With Susie can’t complete,
The apple of my eye!
