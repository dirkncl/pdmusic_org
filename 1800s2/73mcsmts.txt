1. Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep,
The night is so dreary and long;
I cannot in slumber repose
Until I have heard your sweet song;
The wind whistles loud thro’ the trees,
The thunder is painful to hear,
And when in the heavens it rolls,
I tremble, dear mamma, with fear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep,
The night is so dreary and long;
I cannot in slumber repose
Until I have heard your sweet song.

2. Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep,
Or tell me the story I love,
Where Benny, you say, is at rest,
With angels in heaven above;
The rain beats so hard ’gainst the pane,
I cannot, I fear, close my eyes,
And then the quick flash of the light
Illumines the thick, cloudy skies.

3. Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep,
Come sit by my side just a while;
There’s comfort and faith in your voice,
There’s pleasure and love in your smile;
And when I awake in the morn,
To greet you, as often before,
Your arms will be open for me,
I’ll look for your kiss at the door.
