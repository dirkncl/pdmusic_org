Comic Duett
Words by Harry Birch
Music by William Gooch

1.
[Rachael]
Reuben, I have long been thinking,
  What a good world this might be,
If the men were all transported
  Far beyond the Northern Sea.

[Reuben]
Rachel, I have long been thinking,
  What a good would this might be,
If we had some more young ladies
  On this side the Northern Sea.

[CHORUS 2 times]
[Reuben]
  Too ral loo ral loo,
[Rachel]
  Too ral loo ral,
[Reuben]
  Too ral loo ral loo,
[Rachel]
  Too ral loo lee,
[Reuben and Rachel; overapped voices]
[Rachel]
If the men were all transported
Far beyond the Northern Sea.
[Reuben]
If we had some more young ladies
On this side the Northern Sea.


2.
[Rachael]
Reuben, I'm a poor lone woman,
  No one seems to care for me,
I wish the men were all transported
  Far beyond the Northern Sea.

[Reuben]
I'm a man without a victim,
  Soon I think there's one will be,
If the men are not transported
  Far beyond the Northern Sea.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
[Rachael]
Reuben, what's the use of fooling,
  Why not come up like a man?
If you'd like to have a "lovyer"
  I'm for like your "Sally Ann."

[Reuben]
Oh my goodness! oh my gracious!
  What a queer world this would be,
If the men were all transported
  Far beyond the Northern Sea!

(CHORUS 2 times)

4.
[Rachael]
Reuben, now do stop your teazing,
  If you've any love for me;
I was only just a fooling,
  As I thought of course you'd see.

[Reuben]
Rachel, I will not transport you,
  But will take you for a wife,
We will live on "milk and honey,"
  Better or worse, we're in for life.

(CHORUS 2 times)
