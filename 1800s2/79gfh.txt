1. In  a quiet village near the river 
As a child I loved to roam, 
Where bright flow’rs never seem’d to wither 
There stood my Grandfather’s home. 
I see his face beaming kindly yet 
’Neath his hair so silv’ry gray, 
And I sigh as I watch the red sun set 
From Grandfather’s home far away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
And I hear the dear voices of childhood 
Crying out to the wanderer come, 
Come back from the land of the Stranger 
And rest in our Grandfather’s home.

2. The brook in the home of my childhood
Ran merrily chattering by,
But the dark streams here in the wildwood
Seems but to moan and to sigh.
The oaks and elms nod cheerily there
And the poplars gently sway,
But the cold trees here are bleak and bare
From Grandfather’s home far away.

3. The world is thankless cold and dreary
And its children hard and stern,
How many souls are sad and weary
From the struggle gladly would turn.
And youths that have wandered fancy free
In the dawn of life’s young day.
At the twilight sigh in vain to see
Dear Grandfather’s home far away.
