"Home on the Range" (Dec. 1873)
Traditional Cowboy Song
Words by Dr. Brewster M. Higley, 1823-1911
Music by Daniel E. Kelly, 1843-1905

1.
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

CHORUS
Home, home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

2.
Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down the stream;
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.

(CHORUS)

3.
How often at night when the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars,
Have I stood here amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours.

(CHORUS)

4.
Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours;
The curlew I love hear to scream;
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks
That graze on the mountain-tops green.

(CHORUS)

5.
The red man was pressed from this part of the West,
He's likely no more to return
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
Their flickering campfires burn.

(CHORUS)

6.
Where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free,
The breezes so balmy and light,
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all the cities so bright.

(CHORUS)

7.
Oh, I would not exchange my home on the range,
Where the dear and the antelope play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

(CHORUS)
