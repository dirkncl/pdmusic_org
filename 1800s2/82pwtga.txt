1. He is gone,— our noblest poet,—
He, Columbia‘s brightest star;
Gone to meet our other loved ones,
Passed within the gates ajar.
Though our hearts are sadly aching,
Heavy with a newborn grief,
He  is singing with the angels
Sweeter songs than those of earth.

2. Nevermore in health and beauty
Will we see his face again;
He has found his Life Eternal
And swells loud the heav’nly strain.
Let his hands be meekly folded,
Passion flow’rs upon his breast;
He is with our loving Father,
In a land where all are blest.

3. Though no more in song or sonnet
We his glowing pen can trace,
Still we lift our eyes to heaven,
And see there his radiant face,
Glorified with light Eternal,
Singing anthems with the blest.
Let these words our sad hearts comfort,
“God so loved He gave him rest.”

CHORUS FOR LAST VERSE
He is not dead, but sleeping,
He is not dead, but sleeping,
He is not dead, No, not dead
But only gone before.
