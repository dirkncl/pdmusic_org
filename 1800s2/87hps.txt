1. Wake the song of Home Protection!
Hear those distant wailing sounds;
Feel the trembling of a nation,
Shaken to its utmost bounds.
Louder still, their echoes falling,
Starting now your list’ning ears;
Piteous cry of millions calling
You to stay a nation’s tears.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Shout the song of Home Protection!
Fling our banner to the gale!
Drive the traffic from our nation,
God and Right must yet prevail.

2. Hark! oh, hark! your hosts are marching,
Gath’ring for the coming fray;
Home Protection ranks enlarging,
Fast recruiting day by day;
Hasten then, gird on your armor,
Useless scabbards cast aside,
Rally ’round your waving banners.
Strike for home and manhood’s pride.

3. Nearer swells the sound of battle,
Nerve your souls to join the fray;
On your out posts muskets rattle,
Choose your Captain, haste away!
Strike for wives in sorrow weeping,
Strike for orphans’ pleading cry;
Strike for hearts and vigil keeping;
Vict’ry’s coming, by and by.
