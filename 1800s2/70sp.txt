1. Ring the bells, and beat the drum!
Shake your neighbor’s hand today!
Good old times will surely come,—
Oh, how long they’ve been away!
Gold and silver take “a drop”—
Not a “drop too much,” ’tis plain!
Wall street’s going to shut up shop!—

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Specie payment’s come again!
Ah! Don’t it make your fingers tingle!—
Greenbacks now are on the wane!—
Can’t your hear the jingle, jingle!—
Specie payment’s come again!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Don’t it make your fingers tingle?
Greenbacks now are on the wane!
Can’t you hear the jingle, jingle?—
Specie payment’s come again!

3. “Taxes” now will end the strife
All to break us in a year,
Bachelors can take a wife—
Now they needn’t have a fear!
Old and young we needn’t fret—
Fortune now will have her reign!
All the girls will husbands get—

3. “Bulls and Bears” are in a rage!
Let them fight it out alone;—
Put them in an iron cage
Till they’ve quite contented grown!
Jimmy Fisk his match has found,
Long has he been “raising Cain!”
Female Brokers bro’t it round!

4. Yes, the good old times have come!
’Tis the year of jubilee!
Ring the bells, and beat the drum!
Hang “old Panic” to a tree!
Let the nations have their “row,”
We can “settle up” with Spain!
Grant will “buy” young Cuba now—
