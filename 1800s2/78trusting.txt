1. When in life come darkest hours, 
And the heart is bowed with grief 
Angels whisper soft and low 
Trust in God you’ll find relief 
When life’s shad ows hover round 
And we near the golden shore, 
Then our thoughts will turn back. 
To the friends that have gone before— 
Then our thoughts will turn back 
To the friends that have gone before,
That have gone before. 

2. As the storm the lifeboat tost? 
So the heart on earth will be 
But beyond Eternal rest 
When the soul from earth is free 
When the heart is cold and sad 
And the star of Hope is dim, 
Then we’d fly to our God 
There to dwell in peace with Him 
Then we’d fly to our God 
There to dwell in peace with Him,
In peace with Him.

3. We would live in thee Oh God, 
Give us now our dailly bread 
Thou hast watched the sparrows fall 
And thy hands have ravens fed 
Now we turn to thee in prayer 
Trusting ever in Thy love, 
Guard and guide 
Take us home in thy arms to 
Thy great love Guard and guide 
Take us home In thy arms to thy great love, 
To thy great love.

QUARTETTE
[4.] When in life come darkest hours, 
Comes darkest hours the heart is bowed with 
And this heart is bowed with grief with grief 
Angels whisper soft and low 
Trust in God you’ll find  relief. 
When life’s Shadows hover round 
And we near the golden shore. 
Then our thoughts will turn back 
To the friends that have gone before before. 
Then our thoughts will turn back 
To the friends that have gone before,
That have gone before.
