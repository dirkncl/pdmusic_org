1. A little crib beside the bed,
A tiny face above the spread,
With mild blue eyes and skin so fair,
And flowing curls of golden hair.
A little dress behind the door,
The half worn shoes upon the floor,
A slate— on which faint marks appear,—
And broken pencil lying near.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Fond angels watch her thro’ the night,
But ere the dawn of morning light,
They bore her spirit far away,
And left us but the lifeless clay.

2. The crib is still beside the bed,
But there’s no face above the spread;
The flowers yet upon the stand,
Were placed there by her darling hand
The dress, the shoes and slate are here,
But oh our hearts are sad and drear;
The things which made our hearts so glad,
Now only tent to make us sad.

3. A grassy mound is now her bed,
That face is hid beneath the spread,
We love to linger near the spot,
Where lies the one that’s ne’er forgot.
That cherub form to us so drear,
Doth often in our dreams appear,
Wooing our hearts from earthly toys,
To share with here more lasting joys.
