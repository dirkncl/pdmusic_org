1. Squalling children, scolding wife, 
Were not the pest of my poor life, 
Wheree’er I lived, in house or flats, 
My plague has been those horrid Rats; 
They ate our meat, our bread and shoes, 
We could not have a quiet snoose; 
One day my wife did chance to dose, 
They pinned my baby by the nose.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
R-r-rats! Rats! Rats! Rough on Rats, 
Hang your dog and drown your cats; 
We give a plan for ev’ry man 
To clear his house with _Rough on Rats_.

2. I got a cat, I set a trap. 
And thought to have a quiet nap, 
But scarce in bed we snug were laid 
When round  the room the villians played. 
My wife jumped out upon the door, 
To strike a light, but soon did roar. 
As well she might, for you must know, 
The steeltrap had her by the toe.

3. But Rats were not the only pest 
To spoil our food, and spoil our rest, 
Fresh troubles did each day arise, 
Mice, Roaches, Bugs, Mosquitoes, Flies. 
But now I’ve got the tip at last, 
And soundly sleep and eat quite fast; 
For we have banished all the crew, 
And you shall learn the secret too.
