1. God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest
Thunder Thy clarion, the lightning Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reinest;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

2. God the All merciful! earth hath forsaken
Meekness and mercy, and slighted Thy word;
Let not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

3. God the All righteous One! man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

4. So shall Thy people, with thankful devotion,
Praise Him who saved them from peril and sword,
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean
Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.
AMEN.
