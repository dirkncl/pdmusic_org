1. My Country! tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty 
Of thee I sing; 
Land where my fathers died, 
Land of the Pilgrims’ pride. 
From every mountain side 
Let freedom ring.

2. My native Country, thee 
Land of the noble free 
Thy name I love. 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills. 
My heart with rapture sings 
Like that above.

3. Let music swell the breeze 
And sing from all the trees 
Sweet freedom’s song. 
Let mortal tongues awake, 
Let all that breathe partake. 
Let rocks their silence break, 
The sound prolong.

4. Our fathers God! to thee, 
Author of liberty 
To thee we sing. 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom’s holy light. 
Protect us by thy might, 
Great God our king.
