1. While the shepherds were watching at morn, 
Came an angel from heaven and said: 
Joyous tidings I bring Christ is born 
In a manger at Bethlehem He’s laid 
And the host bright and shining of heaven, 
To swell the glad anthem began: 
Be to God all the great glory given, 
And on earth peace and good will to man.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The same star that at Bethlehem glowed 
Lights our way to the beautiful shores. 
Jesus’ blood that on calvary flowed 
Opens wide for us heav’ns golden doors.

2. Twas for us He the cross bravely bore, 
Up the rugger and steep mountain side; 
Twas for us He the crown of thorns wore, 
And for us flow’d His life’s crimson tide; 
While He suffered, they mocked and reviled, 
But He felt not the arrows thus hurled; 
With a sweet faith, He looked up and smiled, 
And died for a sin shrouded world.

3. Long as stars in their glory shine on, 
Long as silvery moons wax and vane, 
Men shall sing of the victory won 
Thro’ our dear Saviour’s suff’ring and pain; 
When He cam and his life freely gave, 
That the ransom of all he might pay 
Came the vilent of sinners to save. 
And to wash all their dark stains away.
