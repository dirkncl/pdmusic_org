1. Welcome our guests from ev’ry land,
Who come to join with one acclaim.
The anthem of a patriot band, 
Who sing of Freedom’s fame. 
Welcome to all who mingle here 
With those who feel a patriot’s pride, 
In honor of a nation’s life, 
One hundred years have tried.

2. One hundred years, and yet we live
Beneath the banner of the free;
Our grateful thanks, O God we give,
For such a boon, to Thee.
Then let the Starry Banner wave,
Our emblem and our country’s pride,
 In honor of a nation’s life,
One hundred years have tried.

3. Tried in the crucible of time,
To triumph proudly in the right,
From infancy to manhood’s prime,
A giant in its might.
May peace and progress rule the hour,
As they have nobly done or yore;
And hold aloft our country’s power
Ten thousand years and more.
