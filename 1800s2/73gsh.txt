1.
You may talk about good eating,
  Of your oysters and your chowder'd clam,
But it's when I'm awful hungry,
  Then just give me good old sweet ham;

Now some folks may differ with me,
  But their talk is nothing but a sham,
For to touch this darkie's palate,
  Oh! just give me good old sweet ham.

CHORUS
Old ham it is the meat,
For it is always good to eat;
You may

2.
If you want to see good living,
  Just go down to the cabins 'mongst the palms,
And it's there you'll see the children,
  Greas'd all over with a good sweet ham;

Now the possom is good eating,
  When it's cook'd with taters call'd the yam;
But there's nothing yet that suits me
  Just as well as good old sweet ham.

(CHORUS)

3.
Now my song is almost ended,
  And you all know who this darkie am,
For the boys have all nicknam'd me,
  By them calling me old sweet ham;

I am going back to the old home,
  There to pass my life away in calm;
And if you should hear I'm dead,
  Then just lay it to old sweet ham.

(CHORUS)
