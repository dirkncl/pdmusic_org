1. Beautiful bird of spring has come 
Seeking a place to build his home 
Warbling his song so light and free 
Beautiful bird come live with me. 
Come live with me, you shall be free. 
If you will come and live with me. 
Come live with me. 
You shall be free. 
Beautiful bird come live with me. 
I’m all alone 
Come live with
[overlapping voices]
[S]
me. 
[ATB]
come live with me 
come live with me 
come live with me. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come birdie come and live with me. 
We will be happy light and free. 
You shall be all the world to me. 
Come birdie come and live with me. 
You shall be all the world to me. 
Come birdie come and live with me.

2. Ye little birds that sit and sing 
Many a thought of lov’d ones bring 
Hov’ring around your tiny nest 
Calling your lov’d ones home to rest. 
Oh happy bird no thought of care. 
No aching heart, no grief to bear. 
Over the land, 
Over the sea. 
Come change your home and live with me. 
Come change your home 
No more to roam 
Come change your 
[overlapping voices]
[S]
home. 
[ATB]
come change your home 
come change your home 
come change your home. 

3. Birdie what makes you fly away 
When it came near you tell me, pray 
I’ll not deceive you, you are free. 
If you should come and live with me 
Now, birdie fly fast to the sky. 
To your sweet home for night is nigh. 
And then the sun 
Shines o’er the sea. 
Bring thy sweet mate and live with me. 
Then we will sing 
Day light to bring 
Then we will 
[overlapping voices]
[S]
sing.
[ATB]
then we will sing 
then we will sing 
then we will sing.
