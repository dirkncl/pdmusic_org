1. Oh the old home is sad now and dreary, 
The darkies sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
The Banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh it’s all that remains of the children, 
Of the ones that have cherished me so dear 
And no more will I hear their voices singing, 
The good old songs my heart rejoiced to hear. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh the old home is sad now and dreary, 
(sad and dreary, For the)
The darkies sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
And the banjo, (The banjo) now hangs silent on the door.

2. Oh but time makes me fondly remember, 
At evening when the toiling day was done, 
How the folks used to sing and play the banjo, 
For trouble in those good times we had none. 
But their forms in the grave now lie sleeping, 
So dear to me in happy days of yore, 
And I’m left her alone all day weeping, 
The Banjo now hangs silent on the door. 

3. Now old age has come on, and I'm weary, 
The few locks that are left me are quite gray, 
Round the farm ev’ry day I am wandering, 
Yes wandering for I soon must press away. 
So you’ll please listen now and remember, 
When the poor colored man shall be no more, 
Take good care kind friends and part with never, 
The Banjo now hangs on the cabin door.
