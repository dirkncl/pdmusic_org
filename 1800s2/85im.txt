1. Oh, valiant soul, heroic, brave,
The fight is done— no arm could save
The gallant hero of the field
Now to the last dread foe to yield!
The death damp on the warrior’s brow
Proclaims his warfare ended now.
The bugle calls, the march is o’er,
The soldier rests for evermore.
Done with the world— its joys and ills,
His camp fire gleams on heavenly hills.
Oh, valiant soul, beroic, brave,
Gone from earth to the God who gave.

2. Oh, loyal soul, matchless— so grand,
Honored and loved throughout the land,
Endeared to ev’ry freeman’s heart,
With thee the Nation mourns to part.
But deeds resplendent still remain,
A ’scotcheon without spot or stain.
Our children will revere thy name,
And future ages sing thy fame.
Illustrious one, thy deeds shall rise
As fra grant incense to the skies.
Oh loyal soul, in conflict tried,
Faithful here, now glorified!
