When the whippoorwills are calling,
And the apple blossoms are falling,
With a tender tint forestalling
Summer's blush upon the grass;
Where the little stars are keeping,
Watch above the meadows sleeping,
And the Jack-o-lanterns peeping,
I will meet my bonnie lass.

I will seek her, I will find her,
I will shyly stand behind her,
And with kisses I will blind her,
'Till she sees the happy day.
Ah!

And when the barley's heading,
And the summer rose is shedding,
Oh! there'll be a merry wedding,
At the making of the Hay.
