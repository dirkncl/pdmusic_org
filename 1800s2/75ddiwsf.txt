Dedicated to Bob Allen
"De Day I Was Sot Free!" (1875)
Words and Music by Sam[uel] Lucas. [1848-1916]

1. White folks all lend me your attention
I wont detain you long.
I’ll tell you about de mancipation,
In this my simple song.
I was born way down in Louisianna
By my stile you can plainly see,
In dat sunny land I’ve hoed de cotton
My good old wife and me,
Dey told me all de day was gwine to come
And it filled my heart with glee.
Now white folks all I still remember
The day I was sot free.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! yes I’m free
And I’m happy you can see
I nebber shall forget no nebber
De day I was sot free.

2. I’se growing old and am quite feeble,
And my hair am turning gray,
But still I ever shall remember
What I head ole massa say.
Dar’s gwine to be a big commotion
down in dat sunny land,
And, all de dark’s on de plantation
Would be a happy band,
De proclomation papers massa Linco’n signed
in de year of sixty-three.
And I nebber shall forget no nebber
De day I was sot free.
