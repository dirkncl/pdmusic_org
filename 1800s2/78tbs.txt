1. The splendor falls on castle walls 
And snowy mountains old in story. 
The long light shakes across the lakes. 
And the wild cataract leaps in glory. 
Blow bugle blow, set the wild echoes flying, 
And answer echo dying, dying, dying, dying. 

2. O hark, O hear! how thin and clear 
And thinner, clearer, farther going!
O sweet and far from cliff and scar 
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
Blow, let us hear the purple glen replying 
And answer echo dying, dying, dying, dying. 

3. O love, they die in yon rich sky 
They faint on hill, on field, on river. 
Our echoes roll from soul to soul, 
And grow forever, forever. 
Blow bugle blow, set the wild echoes flying, 
And answer echo, dying, dying, dying. dying.
