[with overlapping voices]
Tis the whippoorwill’s song.
He sings in yonder tree,
How he warbles with joy,
His heart is light and free,
’Tis the whippoorwill’s song,
No sorrow will he bring,
Sweetly he sings, Sweetly he sings.
Ah,
Come while the rose buds are wet with dew,
Come while the stars shine from heav’n so blue,
Come to a heart that is loving and true,
Ah, Ah,
Softly, tenderly is the lay,
Turning night into brightest day;
Sweet are the memories Thy song doth bring,
Ah, Sweetly he sings,
Ah, Sweetly he sings. Ah happy bird
Ah happy bird, Ah, Sweetly he sings
Sing, La La, happy bird. La, La, La.
La, La, La, La, La, La, La Sing happy bird,
Sing, Sing, Sing sweetly sing.
There is comfort to me in thy song.
Sing sweetly sing
Daylight will be here ere long.
Happy bird sweetly
Oh!
La, La,
Sing,
happy bird
La, La, La, happy bird.
Sing, Sing, Sing happy bird.
hast thou ever known
La
sorrow or pain
La, La,
La, La, La,
Tell, oh! tell me
Do love’d ones e’er come back again?
’Tis the whippoorwill’s song,
He sings in yonder tree,
How he warbles with joy,
His heart is light and free,
’Tis the whippoorwill’s song,
No sorrow will he bring,
Sweetly he sings,
Sweetly he sings,
Ah, he sings.
