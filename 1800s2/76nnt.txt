1. There is no night there, but one endless day 
In that beautiful home away far away.
Just beyond the river that land I meet— 
Loved ones are waiting to welcome thee.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
There is no night there, no night there.
God is the light, there is no night there.
No night there, no night there, 
God is the light, there is no night there.

2. Why are we troubled here below, 
To that beautiful land we soon shall go.
Who will meet us? What shall we see 
When we get over the jasper sea.

3. Flow’rs are blooming on every hand, 
Rivers like crystal in that beautiful land, 
Music the sweetest, Flowers most rare, 
We’ll dwell with our Father, there is no night there.
