1. The Trumpet sounds the challenge loud, and calls us to the field
Bring on the helmet, sword and lance, the battleaxe and shield.
Advance the pure white standard now, its crimson cross shall flame,
Where conflict rages fiercely wild, and prow ess wins a name.
  Where conflict rages fiercely wild, and prowess wins a name.

2. The Warrior hurls his gauntlet bold, against set form and creed,
Of error, wrong, oppression sore, and cruelty, and greed;
His solemn vow’s recorded, to do battle for the right,
While life and strength endureth to maintain the glorious fight.
  While life and strength endureth to maintain the glorious fight.

3. ’Tis “Justice” forms the hilt of sword, and “Fortitude” its blade,
While “Mercy” at its shining point shall never be restrained;
Right valiantly he wields it, for the widow, orphan, maid,
Whose loyal cause unto the death shall ever be maintained.
  Whose loyal cause unto the death shall ever be maintained.

4. The Knight, by chance in battle dread, may be unhorsed and slain,
His memory, green and fragrant still, forever shall remain.
The crown he will receive at last, when Paradise is won,
In brilliant lustre shall exceed the glory of the Sun.
  In brilliant lustre shall exceed the glory of the Sun.
