1. Farewell for ever my darling,
Dear to me even now.
I give you back your promise.
Release you from your vow.
I learned the love I’d sought for
Was given to one before.
I knew the love of your nature
Was true for ever more.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Farewell for ever my darling,
Dear to me even now.
I give you back your promise.
Release you from your vow.

2. If you had but told me truly
Your heart was giv’n away.
No more I know the sorrow
That crushes my soul to day.
Why should I cruelly blame you
For the love in my bosom hid.
’Twas the pangs of my heart that led me
To love you as I did
