1. Growing older day by day, 
It is sweet to dream of this— 
In the years now pass’d away, 
With their scenes of joy and bliss; 
Over all the rosy past, 
Recollections footsteps climb 
To these hours too bright to last, 
In the happy olden time.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Softly, sweetly, to and fro, 
Still the bells of mem’ry chime; 
While bright visions come and go, 
Of the happy olden time.

2. How we love to live again 
Childhood’s fair and sunny hours, 
Wand’ring down the dear old lane, 
Through the paths of fairest flow’rs; 
Straying by each cherish’d spot 
Where in youth we loved to climb 
Not the slightest word forget, 
Since the happy old en time.

3. From those days now dim and old 
Many visions oft arise, 
Dimpled cheeks and locks of gold, 
Sunny smiles and laughing eyes, 
Mother love and childish pray’r, 
Whisper’d in a simple rhyme; 
Unforgotten over there, 
In the happy olden time.
