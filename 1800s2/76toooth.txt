1. I’ve been thinking of the happy days,
When I was young and gay;
And all the happy scenes of old,
’Fore Massa went away;
But when he linger’d at the farm,
My eyes with joy would fill,
But now he sleeps beneath the oak,
The old oak on the hill.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The old home is so lonely,
But Oh, I love it still,
For I love to linger only
Near the old oak on the hill.

2. Many hours I sit and while away,
Up on the old hill side;
I linger there from day to day,
Beneath its branches wide;
And often does my poor heart weep,
And tears they come at will,
But soon, I know I’ll rest beneath
The old oak on the hill.

3. Now I have not long to tarry here,
My trouble’s nearly oe’r;
I soon will know no pain or fear,
I then will grieve no more;
But then I’ll linger at the farm,
Where scenes my heart may thrill,
For soon they’ll lay me down beneath
The old oak on the hill.
