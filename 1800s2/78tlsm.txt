1. All the day my way I’m wand’ring
Thro’ the busy crowded street
Never rest till stars are shining
My weary tired feet
I’ve no home or friends to love me
No bright happy face to dwell
I sleep with the skies above me
I’m a little street mackerel.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Nothing to eat very often
Ragged my clothes and chill
In the biting blasts of winter
O pity the street mackerel.

2. Long ere the day is dawning
I am up with my papers new
Gladly shout this sunny morning
And run the whole day through
Sometimes when I pass a mansion
Where the rich and the happy dwell
A tear falls from the eyelid
Of the little street mackerel.

3. When the shades of ev’ning falling
And the world has gone to sleep
Still my song I’m loudly calling
While stars their vigils keep
Where I rest when work is over
It were hard indeed to tell
’Neath a shed or by the corner
Sleeps the little street mackerel.
