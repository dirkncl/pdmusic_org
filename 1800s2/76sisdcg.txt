1. I’m far from de land whar I first saw de light,
I long to return, oh, just once again;
Down in sweet Dixie’s land ’tis de best place of all;
When I think of the past, I’m in pain;
I miss de ole friends dat I lov’d so well,
I miss de cotton buds, and de happy darkies’ mirth;
I don’t want to stay From de sweet sunny south,
It’s de only bright spot on dis earth.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
It’s long, long ago since I saw de cotton grow,
To Dixie’s land I want to go before it is too late.
De angels are calling,
And say I must come,
Oh, dey won’t have much longer time to wait.

2. Near the banks of the stream whar de wild flowers grow,
An’ de whitewash’d cabin stands on de hill,
Dar de ole folks would oft times  sit by de door;
Ah! I see them in memory still;
But de green grass grows whar de ole folks sleep,
And my time’s coming soon I know;
Take me back to de South, Let me see it again,
For it’s long since I saw de cotton grow.
