1. I hab always tried to do 
What I  though was best and right, 
Since I lib’d on dis side Canaan’s shore, 
Tho’ I’se never complained much, 
Still my heart has ne’er grown cold, 
For I live o’er the happy days of yore, 
I’ll sing and dance and play, 
I’ll be happy while I may, 
Till I go to that far off distant land, 
And I know dat I shall see 
Dar in heaben’s minstrelsy, 
All my children in dat good angel band.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Let the chariot come, 
Take de old man home, 
For he can’t neber work de fields no more, 
But I’se going to sing and play, and be happy while I may, 
Till I pass to dat bright happy shore.

2. Tho’ dey all have gone to rest, 
Both my wife and children dear, 
In the churchyard dey are all laid, way, 
But I connot wish dem back, 
Tho’ the world to me am black, 
And I often do shed for dem a tear, 
Yet I must happy be, 
Tho’ dey all have gone from me, 
To day land, better land, so far away, 
No, I’ll think not of the past, 
But all trouble’s from me cast, 
And I’ll sing and be happy night and day.

3. Now de good old days are gone, 
Yes dem old plantation times, 
When I work’d in de cotton fields all day, 
Then I play’d de old banjo, 
Sang the songs I used to know, 
In de bright sunny land so far away, 
I’ll sing and dance and play, 
And be happy while I may, 
Till I go to that far off distant land, 
And I know dat I shall see 
Dem in heaben’s minstrelsy, 
And my children in dat good angel band.
