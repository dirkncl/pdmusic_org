1. Like a golden ocean, spreading far away,
O’er the dark horizon looks the parting day.
In the leafy woodland early shadows rest,
And the weary warbler hastens to her nest.
From the cottage window, like a beacon bright,
Glares the mirror’d sunset, fading with the night.

2. To the shady lane, love, let us then repair,
While the twilight shadows are so soft and fair.
As we slowly saunter, shall we hear no sound,
Save the rustling music of the leaves around,
Soaring on in radiance thro’ the orient sky,
See the orb of eveing beaming from on high.

3. Thus the day of life, love, sadly sinks away!
Thus the hope of life, love, dies with slow delay!
Come a deep’ning shadow, like a sober pall,
With its dark embraces thrown around us all.
Yet upon that night, love, like you orb, shall rise
Calm and constant faith, lve, in God’s Paradise.
