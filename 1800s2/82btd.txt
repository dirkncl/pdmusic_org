In the hands of the morn before the dawn 
I waken to think of thee 
And all the sweet day 
Thus begun as hallowed seems to be 
In the holy repose the morning star 
with trembling awaits the sun 
And thus my heart if near or far awaits thee 
sweetest one awaits thee, sweetest one. 
In a golden ecstacy of bliss the fair morning star will die 
But I immortal by thy kiss live but when thou art nigh 
But I immortal by thy kiss live but when thou are nigh. 
I live but when thou art nigh.
