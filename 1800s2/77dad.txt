1.
Dreaming and drifting together
Down life's fair stream you and I
Ever around as clear weather
Smiling and azure as the sky.
Iver the soft rippling waters
Floating on smoothly and slow,
Never a care near as loiters
As the sweet hours come and go,
  Never a care near as loiters
  As the sweet hours come and go.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dreaming
Dreaming and drifting
drifting
dreaming and drifting
drifting afloat on life's beautiful stream
Dreaming
Dreaming and drifting
Drifting
dreaming and drifting
how all our days like a paradise seem.

2.
Dreaming and drifting and gliding
Ever by fairest of stands,
Only sweet words never chiding
Kisses and clasps of the hands.
Passing the islands of sadness
Heeding on shadows or pain,
Into the sunshine of gladness
Dreaming and drifting again,
  Into the sunshine of gladness
  Dreaming and drifting again.

3.
Dreaming and drifting to never
Waken to sorrow and tears,
Laughter and sweet smiles forever
Banishing all of our fears.
Heart close to heartstorms defying
Learning the ways that are best,
Since in the course of times flying
Cometh to us peace and rest,
  Since in the course of times flying
  Cometh to us peace and rest.
