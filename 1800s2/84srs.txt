1. Sleep Robin sleep 
While mother watches o’er you, 
And bright starry skies 
Bend o’er the sleeping land. 
Rest birdie rest. 
The world is all before you, 
And pleasure and pain 
Go ever hand in hand.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sleep Robin Lullaby. 
Rest birdie Lullaby. 
Sleep
(Sleep, Robin Sleep,)
(Rest, birdie rest,)
Sleep Robin Lullaby.


2. Sleep Robin sleep 
With mother’s wing above you, 
And softangel eyes 
To guard thy sleeping form. 
Rest birdie rest. 
May angels ever love you, 
And walk by your side 
In sunshine and in storm.
