1. O hoi-ye-ho, Ho-ye-ho who’s for the ferry? 
(The briar’s in bud the sun going down,) 
And I’ll row ye so quick and I’ll row ye so steady, 
And ’tis but a penny to Twickenham Town. 
The Ferryman’s slim and the Ferryman’s young, 
And he’s just a soft twang in the turn of his tongue; 
And he’s fresh as a pippin and brown as a berry; 
And ’tis but a penny to Twickenham Town.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Oh-oi-ye-ho, Ho-ye-ho, Ho-ye-ho, Ho!

2. O hoi-ye-ho, Ho-ye-ho I’m for the ferry? 
(The briar’s in bud the sun going down.) 
And it’s late as it is, and I haven’t a penny, 
And how shall I get me to Twickenham Town? 
She’d a rose in her bonnet, and Oh! she look’d sweet 
As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat; 
With her cheeks like a rose, and her lips like a cherry; 
And sure and you’re welcome to Twickenham Town.

3. O hoi-ye-ho, Ho you’re too late for the ferry? 
(The briar’s in bud the sun going down.) 
And he’s not rowing quick, and he’s not rowing steady; 
You’d think ’twas a journey to Twickenham Town. 
O hoi, and O ho, you may call as you will, 
The moon is a rising on Petersham Hill; 
And with Love like a rose in the stern of the wherry, 
There’s danger in crossing to Twickenham Town.
