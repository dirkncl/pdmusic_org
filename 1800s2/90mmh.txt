1. Behind a grammar schoolhouse
In a double tenement,
I live with my old mother
And always pay the rent;
A bed room and a parlor
Is all we call our own,
And you’re welcome ev’ry evening
At Maggie Murphy’s home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
On Sunday night, ’tis my delight
And pleasure don’t you see,
Meeting all the girls and all the boys,
That work down town with me,
There’s an organ in the parlor
To give the house a tone,
And you’re welcome ev’ry evening
At Maggie Murphy’s home.

2. Such dancing in the parlor,
There’s a walze for you and me;
Such mashing in the corner,
And kisses too, maybe;
We bless the leisure hours
To working people known,
And they’re welcome ev’ry evening
At Maggie Murphy’s home.

3. It’s from the open window
At the noontime of the day,
You’ll see the neighbour’s children
So happy at their play;
There’s Jimmy with his Nelly
Together romp and roam,
And they gather in the schoolyard
Near Maggie Murphy’s home.

4. I walk through Hogan’s Alley
At the closing of the day,
To greet my dear old mother,
You’ll hear the neighbours say:
‘Oh, there goes little Maggie,
I wish she were my own:
Oh, may blessings ever linger
O’er Maggie Murphy’s home.
