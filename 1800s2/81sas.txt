1. Slowly and sadly borne to the tomb,
Him whom we loved so well,
Pride of the Nation veiled in deep gloom,
By the dread fun'ral knell;
Silently, tearfully, with sacred tread,
Borne to his rest, the brave hero now dead.
Tenderly, lovingly, wept o're the bier,
Many true friends, of our loved Ruler dear;

QUARTET
Slowly and sadly borne to the tomb,
Him who we loved so well,
Pride of the Nation veiled in deep gloom.
By the dread fun'ral knell.

2. Grand, noble chieftain, great and good man,
Fond tender husband too.
Kind loving father, righteous his plan,
Loyal to all good and true;
Peacefully sleeping his long and last sleep,
Nation and family sorrow and weep,
Free now from suff'ring, and resting from care,
May we all meet him, in heaven "over there;"

(QUARTET)
