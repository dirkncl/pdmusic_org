1. The robin sang his sweetest lay,
  The wild flowers bloom’d aain,
A round the cot beneath the trees,
  Where dwelt sweet Nettie Bane,
Near the bright streamlet oft in spring,
  We’ve wander’d side by side.
She whisper’d once that she’d be mine,
  Some day my loving bride,
She  whisper’d once that she’d be mine,
  Some day my loving bride, 

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Angle Nettle sweetly sleeping,
’Neath the willows in the lane,
Never more on earth we’ll see thee,
Darling little Nettle Bane.

2. But never did I claim that one,
  On earth I lov’d so well,
What grief and pain there came to me,
  No mortal tongue can tell,
She laid her head upon my breast,
  As I kissed her o’er and o’er.
The angels led her by the hand,
  To yonder happy shore.
The angels led her by the hand,
  To yonder happy shore.
