1. Two little darlings pare and sweet, 
Were nestling in their little bed; 
Their dimpled arms and tiny feet, 
Thrown restless o’er the snowy spread 
Angels there were, if such ere slept, 
Beneath high Heaven’s brightest beams; 
Chide not for by their side I crept, 
And kissed the darlings in their dreams!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Smiling so sweetly as they slept, 
Like Heaven now the picture seems; 
When softly by their side I crept, 
And kissed the darlings in their dreams.

2. Awake not innocence like this, 
Untouched by bitter earthly woes; 
But let them slumber ’neath the kiss, 
That sweetly lengthens their repose; 
Too soon they’ll wake to earnest life, 
Perhaps engage in worldly schemes; 
Wake them not, they’re free from strife, 
And happy in their peaceful dreams!
