1.
Dis Kintry's gwine to de dogs at last 
When de farmer sets a watch 
And a big bull dog and a big steel trap 
In de water milion patch. 
An' wus dan all dats happened yet 
Dat makes us all feel sore 
When ebber you trabbel around you'll find
Dars a lock on de Chick-en coop door. 

Refrain and CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! Aunt Susan! 
Did you eber hear ob dat before, 
Whar eber you trabbel around you'll find 
Dars a lock on de Chicken coop door. 

2.
De pullets dey flop dar wings and crow 
When a darkey passes by 
Dey seem to say dat dey cant be cotched 
And it aint no use to try. 
Oh! Gabriel blow de mighty horn 
We cant stay here no more 
For if we do we will starve to death 
Dars a lock on de Chick-en coop door. 

3.
And when we've a wedding party now 
Oh! what am we a gwine to do 
Oh whar am de pullets a comin from 
For to put dat party froo. 
Oh! hang up de banjo on de wall 
We'll rattle de bones no more 
Dis kintry's gwine to de dogs at last 
Dars a lock on de Chick-en coop door.
