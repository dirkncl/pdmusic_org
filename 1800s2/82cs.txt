1. 
A puss as white as snow, 
  Sat on a neighbor’s shed, 
A waiting for her beau 
  To come whith nimble tread; 
She waited there not long 
  Ere Thomas hove in sight, 
When thus wise ran their song 
  Upon that moonlight night, 
First he would lovingly cry, 
Then she would sweetly reply, 

[REFRAIN sung after each vers, in _Falsetto_]
Meow! 
Meow! 
Meow, ow, ow, ow, ow! 
Meow, ow, ow, 
Meow, ow, ow, 
Meow, ow, ow, ow, ow, 
Meow, ow, 
Meow, 
Meow, ow, ow, 
Meow, 
Meow, 
Meow, ow, ow, ow.

2. 
So close these felines sat, 
  Beneath the moonbeams pale,
That none could tell which cat
  ’Twas owned the whitest tail;
The dreaming world slept on,
  And other cats crept by,
And so till almost morn,
  Was heard their plaintive cry—
As both were othodox cats,
They sang when through their spats:

3. 
True love ne’er smoothe did run, 
  An ancient saw, but true,
And thiers had scarce begun
  Before its truth they knew;
A benedict near by
  Sprang from his attic bed,
His bootjack then let fly,
  Which lit on Tommy’s head!
And now, when midnight is nigh
Their ghosts still utter the cry:
