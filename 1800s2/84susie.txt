1. There is an eye that never sleeps
Beneath the wing of night;
There is an ear that never shuts
When sing the beams of light. 

2. There is an arm that never tires
When human strength gives way;
There is a love that never fails
When earthly loves decay.

3. That eye is fixed on seraph throngs;
That arm upholds the sky;
That ear is filled with angel songs;
That love is throned on high.
