1. Good bye old massa I’se a dying, 
My hours are number’d now, 
And soon in peace I’ll be lying, 
Death’s damp is on my brow, 
Den bring de white folks one and all, 
I’se ben a niggur true, 
And ere I hear my maker’s call, 
I’ll bid dem all Adieu.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den bring de white folks one and all, 
I’se ben a niggur true, 
And ere I hear my maker’s call, 
I’ll bid dem all Adieu.

2. Yes, did dem all adieu, for I 
Can neber say farewell, 
It seems to me de last good bye, 
And surely I’se been tell, 
Dat dis bright land where I’se a guine, 
Is a land dats just and right, 
And each one dar will equaly shine, 
If his soul be just as white.

3. And missus I will meet her there, 
And little Josey too, 
And master John de brave and fair, 
Who died while wearing de blue, 
Oh happier den all happy  things, 
When a life well spent is ending, 
And de happy thought which a deathbed brings, 
And de grace of God descending.

4. Den dig my grave ’neath the chestnut tree, 
Wid de spade I used so long, 
And all join in and sing for me, 
A good old methodist son, 
Yes shout it loud, that I may know, 
By faithful hearts ’tis giv’n, 
And while you sing it down below, 
I’ll shout it back from heav’n.
