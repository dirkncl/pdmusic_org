1.
When I'm dead and gone from you darling,
When I'm laid away in my grave,
When my spirit has gone to Heaven above,
To Him who my soul will save;
When you are happy and gay once more,
Thinking of days that have been;
This one little wish I ask of you,
See that my grave's kept green.

2.
Tho' hours of joy now are passing,
Yet how soon, alas, they will fade;
Tho' your glances of love are meeting my own,
Fair sunlight will turn to shade;
When from the world and its hopes I go,
Leaving forever this scene;
Tho' others are dear, ah, will you then
See that my grave's kept green.

3.
Will you keep me love in remembrance,
Tho' the voice of chiding be heard;
And while others may speak in censure or blame,
Yet breathe no unkindly word;
Tell me you'll think of the happy past,
Think of the joys we have seen;
This on little promise keep for me--
See that my grave's kept green.
