1. ’Twas but a dream! and yet I heard 
My name in accents clear, 
My name in accents clear. 
Named by those lips, 
Whose lightest word 
Is music to mine ear! 
Is music to mine ear! 

[REFRAIN sung after verse 1 and 2]
O thou, so loved, 
O thou, so justly dear! 
Would thou wert here, 
Would thou wert here! 
O thou so justly dear, 
Would thou wert here, 
Would thou wert here, would thou wert here, 
Would thou wert here, would thou wert here! 

2. ’Twas but a dream! and yet me thought 
I knew that silvery tone, 
I knew that silvery tone. 
With all affection’s sweetness fraught, 
calling on me alone! 
On me! on me alone! 

3. Each pleasure I once, I once deem’ so great. 
Now cold and joyless seems, 
Now cold and joyless seems, 
Without thee I am, I am desolate. 
Come to me still in dreams, 
Come to me still in dreams. 

[REFRAIN]
O thou, so loved, 
O thou so justly dear, 
Would thou wert here, 
Would thou wert here; 
O thou, so justly dear, 
Would thou wert here, would thou wert here, 
Would thou wert here, would thou wert here, 
would thou wert here.
