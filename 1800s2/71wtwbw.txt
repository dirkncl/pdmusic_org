1. Where the woodland birdlings warble,
On the green forest trees
Sending sweetest tones of gladness,
Floating out on the breeze
At the side of the clear winding stream,
Thro’ the wildwood in my childhood,
Often Ive roamed o’er the scene,
There pass’d my youth’s happy dream

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Where the woodland birdlings warble
Songs of beauty and glee
Lies my cherished greenwood valley,
’Naught is dearer to me
All thro’ the green wildwood,
Soft silv’ry tones ringing,
Floating comes each echo,
Birdies singing
Where the woodland birdlings warble,
On the green forest trees
Sending sweetest tones of gladness,
Floating out on the breeze

2. Where the myrtle and the Ivy,
Climb each tall wildwood tree
Where the balmy, golden sunlight,
Falls on hillside and lea
Oh there where the wild flowers grow,
Bright and blooming so perfuming,
And as the May breezes blow,
Smiling they nod to and fro

3. Where the rosy moon at ev’ning
Sheds her soft silver light
Where the bright stars gaily twinkly,
Keeping guard o’er the night
I’ve strolled hand in hand with dear friends,
Gay and smiling, hours beguiling,
Mem’ry enchantment still lends,
Backward my thought oft extends
