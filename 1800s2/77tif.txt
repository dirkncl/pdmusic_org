1. Twilight is stealing over the sea,
Shadows are falling dark on the lea
Borne on the nightwinds, voices of yore
Come from the faroff shore.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Far away beyond the starlit skies,
Where the lovelight never, never dies.
Gleamesth a mansion filled with delight,
Sweet, happy home so bright!

2. Voices of loved ones! songs of the past!
Still linger round me while life shall last;
Lonely I waner, sadly I roam,
Seeking that faroff home.

3. Come in the twilight, come, come to me!
Bringing some message over the sea,
Cheering my pathway while here I roam,
Seeking that faroff home.
