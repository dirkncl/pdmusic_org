[NB: this is a paraphrase of the lyrics]

We are three young singing birds, 
And we sing right merrily, we are so full of glee, 
and I Miss Ursala, and 
I Miss Ghisela, 
I am Miss Barbara, 
Barbara, Ghisela, Ursala! 
Each like the others nature made us, 
alike our ears and noses, 
one diff¹rence only you will find, 
and that each sweet voice discloses 
and I, I hoot, hoot, hoot like the owl! 
I mock the mocking bird, 
I warble like the lark, 

For neither likes to be alone, 
no I can’t be alone, and also poor Miss Ursala 
Is punish’d too Miss Ghisela, 
Is naughty sweet Miss Barbara, 
for all are pets of our Mama!
