1. From a rocky bound Atlantic, to a mild Pacific shore,
From a fair and sunny southland to an icebound Labrador,
There’s a name of magic import and ’tis known the world thrughout,
’Tis a mighty corporation, called the Great Rock Island Route.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Now listen to the jingle, and the rumble, and the roar,
As she dashes thro’ the woodland and speeds along the shore,
See the mighty rushing engine, hear her merry bell ring out,
As they speed along in safety, on the “Great RockIsland Route.“

2. All great cities of importance can be found along its way,
There’s Chicago and Peoria and RockIsland so they say,
With Davenport, and westward still is Council Bluffs far out,
As a western termination, of this Great Rock Island Route.

3. To the great southwest another, and a mighty line they run,
Reaching far famed Kansas City, Leavenworth and Atchison,
Rich in beauty, power, and grandeur, and they owe it all no doubt.
To the fact that they are stations, on the Great RockIsland Route.

4. There’s their “NorthernRoute,” a daisy as you all can plainly see
To St. Pail, and Minneapolis, ’tis the famous “Albert Lee;”
To the lakes of Minnesota, and all points there ’round about
Reached directly by no other, than the “Great RockIsland Route.”

5. Now let music soft and tender, in its mystic power reveal,
Paisses to the “Great RockIsland,” that the heart can only feel;
And to swell the mighty chorus— comes the glad reechoing shout,
That for safety, time and comfort, take the “Great RockIsland Route.”
