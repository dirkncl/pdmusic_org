1. I received an invitation 
To play a game of ball, 
And so I journeyed thither, 
Accomp’nied by my gal! 
My side was in, I went to bat, 
Just like a bold draggoon, 
And when the ball came near me, sure I drove it to the moon! 
I let the bat then quickly drop, then chased the basses round; 
Arrived upon the homeplate with my limbs all safe and sound! 
My side almost went crazy, the band commenced to play; 
And when I asked the reason why, they all began to say!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
We are the people, you are the dandy, 
You’ve hit it a whack now which quite takes the bun! 
You are a beauty, you’ve done your whole duty, 
You’re a Daisy, Mc. Guffin since you made that home run!

2. Pat MeCann stepped up to me then. 
Says he sure you’re a King, 
To see you swipe that baseball, 
Was enough to make one sing! 
Come boys a tiger we’ll give him, 
Or sure, your heads I’ll break, 
And when he dies begorra we’ll give him a rousing wake! 
I went to get some beer to drink and find a cooler place; 
When “’pon me soul” a boquet struck me squarely in the face! 
I stood the situation, like any other man; 
When Katie Duffy whispered as she tapped me with her fan!
