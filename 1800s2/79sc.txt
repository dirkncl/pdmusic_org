1.
Oh de noontime, chilen, is a creepin' dis way,
We'll soon hear de dinner horn blow,
Oh, take dem tie-vines, tackle 'em I say,
An' pull for de end ob de row!

CHORUS 1
Oh! time's a rollin' on!
Oh, time's a rollin' on!
Oh, slay de grass crossways, clip de weeds clean,
Kase time's a rollin' on!

2.
The clouds am risin' way off in de sky,
I spect's gwine to rain pretty soon;
Hit's a mighty good sign when de fishhawk cry,
About dis quarter ob de moon.

CHORUS 2
Oh! time's a rollin' on!
Oh, time's a rollin' on!
Jest keep yo' hoes dancin' handle dem blades,
Kase time's a rollin' on!

3.
Oh! bend to yo' tack an' whistle wid de sun,
  Don't you mind de sweat a droppin' down;
Des prartin' un quick, till de work's well done;
  De eatin' tim'll soon be around!

CHORUS 3
Oh! time's a rollin' on!
Oh, time's a rollin' on!
Yonder comes de hoss, down de little turn tok,
An' time's a rollin' on!

4.
Oh! de lightnin' flash, an' de thinder speak low,
  De black crow's a sailin' wid de win';
Dah ain't a single sign ob de crooked rainbow
  Ad de place where it aught to hab bin,

CHORUS 4
Oh! time's a rollin' on!
Oh, time's a rollin' on!
Let yo' muscles slip, an' de good geese fly,
Kase time's a rollin' on!

5.
An' now we 'lustrate to de po' sinner man,
  By singin' him dis little song,
To take mighty care that he ain't behind han'
  When de las' thunder-clap come along!

CHORUS 5
Oh! time's a rollin' on!
Oh, time's a rollin' on!
Kick de debbil endways, don't forget to pray,
While time's a rollin' on!
