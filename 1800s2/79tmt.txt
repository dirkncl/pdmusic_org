1.
Cast your eye on this wretch while he sings you a song
  Of the mis'ry he's had to endure,
How he loved a fair damsel named Belinda Long,
  How she shook him because he was poor.
Now this Belinda Long was the half of two twins
  And the other her name was Ann Jane.
They looked like each other as near as two pins,
  Tho' they each had a different name.

2.
Now, Belinda had pinned on her arm a blue tape
  While Ann Jane had one of bright red,
But alas! one dark night how I grieve to relate
  These twins got all mixed up in bed.
When morning dawned clear, no tapes wer in sight.
  Their mother got all in a mix.
And the twins both together got into a fight,
  Which put the whole house in a fix.

3.
Now I couldn't tell which was Belinda my love,
  When I called on my darling last night,
I thought of all plans, and vainly I strove
  Among them to make matters right.
I knew that Belinda had one crooked toe,
  So I started to find poor Ann Jane;
But again I was doomed, and my heart filled with woe.
  Their toes were exactly the same.

4.
Now I cannot tell which of the twins was my girl
  Since the night they got mixed up in bed--
The thought of it all puts my brain in a whirl
  And I nearly go out of my head.
Now, warning please take from this unhappy man
  And never go into a stew,
If there are twins in the house and you love only one
  You had go marry the two.
