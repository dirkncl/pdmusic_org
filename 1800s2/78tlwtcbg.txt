1. Oh, I’m tired most to death, and I’m almost out of breath.
I’ve traveled such a long and weary road 
My heart is very sad, and it used to be so glad, 
Of care this darky now has got a load.
To the cabin far away, where the darkies were so gay.
And the banjo used to ring with merry sound.
My mind it travels back, o’er the long and weary track, 
And I see the cabin tumbled to the ground.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, the happy dars are gone, my heart is sad and lone.
The world is full of trouble and of woe.
And no more the darkies sing, and no more the banjo rings, 
In the land where the cotton blossoms grow.

2. ’Twas long before the war that I was so happy there, 
With Dinah and the children on my knee 
And massa was so kind to my mother old and blind.
I wonder why the folks set us free.
Oh, it broke poor Dinah’s heart when from missus she did part.
I never see her smiling any more 
Till she saw the angels come, that was going to take her home.
They took her over on the other shore.

3. No matter wher I go I must always take this hoe, 
’Tis all I’ve got to mind me of the past.
It’s been a trusty friend, so I’ll keep it to the end.
I know the time is coming mighty fast.
Oh, the rest will be so sweet when this poor old darky’s feet, 
No longer thro’ this troubled world must roam.
And I’m waiting now to go over on the other shore.
For to meet with Dinah in that better home.
