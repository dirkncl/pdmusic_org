1. When the dewdrops brightly glisten
In the gentle summer breeze,
Through the night I sometimes listen
To the scandal in the trees,
To the ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.
To the ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.

1 & 3. Chorus or Quartette [sung after each VERSE]
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Is the summer fairy’s evening song,
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Surely something with poor Katy must be wrong.
Johnny Bibbin
Elfin, goblin, gnome and sprite,
Quarrel through the summer night,
While the stars are looking down through the air.
Jug o’rum, Jug o’rum.
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Katy did,
Katy didn’t,
Fie! for shame thus to blame Katy dear. Is the summer fairy’s evening song,
Is the summer fairy’s evening song,

1, 2, & 3. CHORUS
Fie! for shame thus to blame Katy dear.

2. Who was Katy I have wondered,
What she did or did not do,
That her crime should thus be thundered
Every night the summer through,
In this ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.
To the ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.

2. CHORUS.
How they quarrel on their midnight spree.
Are’nt you glad that Katy’s neither you nor me.
Still the story’s all the same,
Gossip, scandal, who’s to blame;
Thus to bandy Katy’s name in the air. How they quarrel on their midnight spree.
How they quarrel on their midnight spree.
Are’nt you glad that Katy’s neither you nor me.
Are’nt you glad that Katy’s neither you nor me.
Are’nt you glad that Katy’s neither you nor me.
Still the story’s all the same,
Gossip, scandal, who’s to blame;
Thus to bandy Katy’s name in the Still the story’s all the same,
Gossip, scandal, who’s to blame;
Thus to bandy Katy’s name in the Still the story’s all the same,
Gossip, scandal, who’s to blame;
Thus to bandy Katy’s name in the air. air. air.

3. Fie! for shame to thus keep singing
Charges on poor Katy’s name,
Start some other scandal ringing
Katy’s had enough of fame,
With your ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.
To the ever constant song,
Harsh and hateful, never long,
Of the wrong poor Katy did,
Of the wrong poor Katy did.
