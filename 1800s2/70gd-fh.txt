1. Oh Grandfather’s darling a wee thing is she.
She perches and sings like a bird on his knee, 
His silver hair touches the gold of her head, 
As tender he bends to those lips ripe and red, 
We’ve many a maid that is winsome and gay, 
We’ve many a babe like the rosebud in May, 
But search the town over I dare to declare.
In beauty or sweetness there’s none will compare 
With

CHORUS [sung after each verse]

’Tis Grandmother’s name he is calling her by, 
With smile like dear Grandma’s in sweet long ago, 
She gives back a kiss full as loving I trow, 
Dear Grandmother long since went down to her rest, 
And many spring violets have blown o’er her breast, 
Her name and her face does the little one wear.
No wonder that Grandfather smiles thro’ a tear

3. Grandfather is old almost fourscore I ween, 
And full of true grandeur his manhood has been, 
Of days that were stormy and days that were mild.
The crown of his life is the love of a child: 
Oh Grandfather’s darling! Ah, well, it is sweet, 
To see age and childhood so lovingly meet, 
And O! may the Lord, who is merciful ev’r, 
For years yet forbear their sweet friendship to sev’r;
Oh
