1. Down by the river our log hut stands,
Where Father and Mother dwelt;
And the old door latch that was worn by our hands,
And the church where in pray’r we knelt
But years have pass’d since that happy time,
Yet the river keeps rolling alon,
And the rippling sound on the mossy bank,
Is singing the same old song.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Row, Row, Row your boat gently, down the stream,
For all that’s past is gone you know,
And the future’s but a dream.

2. There stands the tree that we used to climb,
And the mill with its rolling din;
And the old wharf boat there it used to float
Where the school boys went to swim
Now high grass grows on the master’s grave
And the river keeps rolling along
And the birds and bees and the waving trees
Are singing the same old song.

3. Time in his rapid remorseless flight,
Has furrow’d our brows with care;
And has mark’d the touch of his wither’d hand
By our silv’ry locks of hair
Tho’ scenes may change and the old log hut
With the seasons may pass away
Yet the friendship true
Which in youth we formed
Shall never know decay.
