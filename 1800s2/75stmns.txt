1. Softly tread, my Nelly’s sleeping
Where the willows gently spread,
Autumn winds are sadly sighing,
Flowrets fair around are dead.
Brook and stream let softly murmur,
Ne’er disturb her peaceful rest,
For my darling sweetly slumbers,
And her spirit now is blest.

REFRAIN and CHORUS [each sung after each VERSE]
Softly tread my Nelly’s sleeping
Where the willow gently weeps.
And the angels bright are keeping
Silent watch where Nelly sleeps.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE
Softly tread, my Nelly’s sleeping,
Where the willows gently weep,
And the angels bright are keeping
Silent watch where Nelly sleeps.

2. Softly speak, my Nelly’s dreaming,
Sleeping in the silent night,
And the stars are mildly beaming,
Shedding forth their gentle light.
Whisper then in accent ever,
Oh fond heart thy throbbing cease,
For my darling rests for ever,
And her spirit is at peace.
