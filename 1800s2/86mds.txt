1. Japonicus McCracken was a dancer of renown, 
And taught the art to all the boys and girls in Limerick town, 
He hired a barn three nights a week from Caroline O’Toole, 
And all the gentry patronized McCracken’s Dancing school.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
They danced the merry hornpipe, and the Dublin City Glide, 
And Celluloid O’Rafferty, the piper, swelled with pride, 
Breakdowns and jigs and reels and Galway Dips were all the rule.
And there were holy ructions at McCrack en’s Dancing School.

2. He gave and eighteencarot hop each month and ev ’ry friend 
Received a onecent postal card that said, “You’ll please attend;” 
The Hooligans and Caseys, Faddens, McAdoos and Burks, 
Came with the Flynns, Muljugginses, McGoogans and McQuirks.

3. They sang and danced around the barn from night until the morn, 
And Flynn hopped on old Birdie Casey’s alabaster corn, 
Jacintha Fadden fainted, Kalsomine Muljuggins squealed, 
And Snozzle Burk went home to have his nose halfsoled and heeled.

4. Mc Quirk had all his back teeth kicked out by McGoogan’s shoe, 
McGoogan’s west eye went in mourning for a week or two;
On Hooligan, McCracken broke his new imported crutch, 
While Desdemona McAdoo spoke Tipperary Dutch.

5. Now if you want to trip upon the light fantastic toe, 
Just write to Jap McCracken and his terms he’ll let you know, 
For he’s the “Star Professor” and his name and fame’s so great, 
That when he dies his wife will get a pension from the State.
