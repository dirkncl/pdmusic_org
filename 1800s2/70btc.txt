1. Mother, where is Minnie now,
Minnie whom we lov’d so well,
Will she never more return,
Has she gone beyond the clouds to dwell?
The angels wanted her to come.
We made for her a snowwhite shroud
And then they took her home to dwell
With them beyond, beyond the clouds.

CNORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Minnie, mother’s wept all day,
And her heart with grief is bowed,
Now on bended knee we ask
To meet once more beyond the cloud.

2. Now my little sister’s gone,
Mother who will play with me,
Will she love me just the same,
Will she still me little sister be?
Mother if we both are good
And try to do what e’er is right,
Will they let our Minne come
Back from beyond the clouds of night?
