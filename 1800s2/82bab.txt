1. There shall dawn a glorious morning,
By and by, by and by;
All the heav’nly hills adorning,
By and by, by and by;
When the lost shall be united,
When the wrongs of life are righted,
When shall bloom the flowers blighted,
By and by, by and by.

2. With the sweet skies bending o’er us,
By and by, by and by;
We shall join the heav’nly chorus,
By and by, by and by;
From from care and free from sighing,
Voice and heart to voice replying,
In a home of joy undying,
By and by, by and by.

3. In the fields beyond the river,
By and by, by and by;
Love shall bloom for us forever,
By and by, by and by;
All the hopes we fondly cherish,
All the sweetest thoughts we nourish,
There shall live and never perish,
By and by, by and by.
