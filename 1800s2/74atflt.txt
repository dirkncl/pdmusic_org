1. Here’s a health
Here’s a health to Lord Tredegar!
  Of noble race is He,
Whose name in Cambria’s annals,
  Shall ever famous be;
From Ivor Hael descended,
  Whose golden arms he bears,
His grand ancestral glory,
   Magnificent he wears.

2. Here’s a health
Here’s a health to Lord Tredegar!
  The Champion of the Poor,
Who, with his bounteous Lady,
  For them keeps open door;
’Tis not on feastdays only,
  Hospitality is found
In the Mansion of Tredegar,
  But all the long year round.

3. Here’s a health
Here’s a health to Lord Tredegar!
  Who, Princelike, lives today,
His fountful heart o’erflowing
   With love in life’s decay;
Adown the way descending,
   Shall peace attend him now,
While wreaths of joy triumphant
    Are twined around his brow.
