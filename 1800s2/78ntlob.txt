1.
Swiftly, O swiftly we're sailing,
Over the billowy foam;
Quickly, O quickly we're passing,
On to our beautiful home,
Land of bright spirit's immorttal,
Home of the happy and blest,
Land where the sad and the weary,
Joyfully, peacefully rest.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Nearing the land of beauty,
Far from the shore of time;
Over the rolling waters,
Into the sunny clime.

2.
Swiftly, O swiftly we're sailing,
Over the ocean of time;
Patiently longing to enter
Into that holier clime;
Blessed abode of the faithful,
Dwelling of mortals set free,
Beautiful, beauttiful kingdom,
Land of the mystical sea. 

3.
Swiftly, O swiftly we're sailing,
Over the waters so dark;
Soon we shall reach the blest portal,
Anchor in safety our bark;
Soon with our kindred and lov'd ones
Waiting to welcome us o'er.
We shall be happy forever.
Safe on the evergreen shore.
