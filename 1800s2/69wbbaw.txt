1. The puir auld folk at hame, ye mind,
  Are frail, and failing sair,
And weel I ken they’d miss me, lad,
  Gin I came hame nae mair,
The grist is out, the times are hard,
  The kine are only three,

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
I canna leave the auld folk now,
We’d better bide a wee,
I canna leave the auld folk now,
We’d better bide a wee.

2. When first we told our story, lad,
  Their blessing fell sae free,
They gave nae thought to self at all,—
  They did not think of me.
But laddie, that’s a time awa,
  And mither’s like to dee:

3. I fear me sair, they’re failing baith,
  For, when I sit apart,
They’ll talk o’ heav’n sae earnestly,
  It well nigh breaks my heart!
So, laddie, dinna urge me mair,
  It surely winna be:
