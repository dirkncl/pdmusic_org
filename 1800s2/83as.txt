1. Oh! sing another song,
Like that you sang so long ago
Whose strains in mem’ry, still prolong
Those thoughts of love you so well know.
In dreams I often hear
Their echoes, which have never died
They fall in music on mine ear
Like linnets notes of eventide,
Oh! sing another song,
Oh! sing another song.

2. Oh! sing another song,
With like abiding joy replete
The past returneth all along
Give for the future tones as sweet.
Commingling all shall live
Like Nature’s voices heard of yore
With new refrains her minstrels give
To cheer and gladden evermore.
Oh! sing another song,
Oh! sing another song.

3. Oh! sing another song
Of charming melody for me,
I would that life like Art were long,
That I might ever dwell with thee,
But sev’rance here below
We must endure and wait life’s end,
There’s harmony in heav’n we know
In which our voices yet shall blend.
Oh! sing another song,
Oh! sing another song.
