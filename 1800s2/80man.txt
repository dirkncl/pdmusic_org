1. When the shadows soft were creeping,
And the sun far down the west;
When the singing birds were sleeping,
And all nature seem’d at rest.
Then the voice of my sweet Nina,
Like the music from above;
Floated sweetly o’er the valley,
Breathing purity and love.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Like the summer flower she faded,
And her spirit pass’d away
Still I hear her voice as ever,
For it haunts me night and day.

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Like the summer flower she faded,
And her spirits pass’d away
Still I hear her voice as ever,
For it haunts me night and day.

2. Never bloom’d on earth a flower,
Half so fair and sweet as she;
Never bird in wood or bower,
Ever sung each melody.
And her spirit knew no sadness,
For her heart was gay and light;
And her eye shone bright with gladness,
As the stars above at night.

3. And her hair with golden ringlets,
Playing ’round a neck of snow;
While her eyes like dancing sunbeams,
Seen on waves as brooklets flow.
And her voice so soft and tender,
Breathing nought but joy and love;
Seem’d like gentile murm’ring accents,
Wafted from some sphere above.
