1. I’ll rock me to sleep in my grandmother’s chair, 
To dream of the days that’s gone by, 
To catch her bright smile like the rainbow of peace 
That spans o’er the storm clouded sky, 
I’ll hear her sweet voice in its love thrill ing tones, 
As she rocked to and fro in her chair. 
I’ll catch the sweet spirit that prompted her song, 
As she plaintively tried it there. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
That old rocking-chair with its great loving arms 
Still holds me and rocks to and fro, 
While in visions so sweet I dream of the joy 
Of my childhood in days long ago.

2. I’ll rock me to sleep and in visions so bright,
I’ll hear her low soft evening prayer,
As she folded my hands at my low trundle bed,
And asked for sweet benizens there,
When the shadows of night fled away in the morn,
And sunshine peeped in at the door
With the sweet singing lark on the meadow and lawn,
My grandma was singing once more. 

3. I’ll rock me to sleep at the close of the day,
And wait for the same angel band,
That early one morn bore her spirit away
To the home of the bright summer land,
I’ll wait for the angels in slumber so sweet,
Who bore her away through the air
To bear me away at life’s closing day,
While rocking in grandmother’s chair.
