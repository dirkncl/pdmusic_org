1. The rosy clouds float overhead,
  The sun is going down,
And now the sandman’s gentle tread
  Comes stealing through the town.
“White sand, white sand,” he softly cries,
  And as he shakes his hand,
Straightway there lies on babies’ eyes
  His gift of shining sand.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
when he goes through the town.
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
when he goes through the town.

2. From sunny beaches far away,
  Yes, in another land,
He gathers up, at break of day,
  His store of shining sand.
No tempests beat that shore remote,
  No ships may sail that way;
His little boat alone may float
  Within that lovely bay.

3. He smiles to see the eyelids close
  Above the happy eyes,
And ev’ry child right well he knows—
  Oh, he is very wise!
But if, as he goes through the land,
  A naughty baby cries,
His other hand takes dull, gray sand
  To close the wakeful eyes.

4. So when you hear the Sandman’s song
  Sound through the twilight sweet,
Be sure you do not keep him long
  Awaiting in the street.
Lie softly down, dear little head,
  Rest quiet, busy hands,
Till by your bed, his goodnight said,
  He strews his shining sands.
