1. A heart heavy laden with sorrow and pain, 
Is all that is left me today 
To remind me of one who has cross’d o’er the main, 
To a land that is far, far away; 
As I stand on the rocks, gazing out on the ships, 
That are winging their way o’er the sea; 
I pray God! the chalice may pass from my lips, 
For the draught is too bitter for me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Dear Robin I’ll be true to thee, 
I’ll love none else but you, 
My heart will ever constant be, 
Dear Robin I’ll be true 
Dear Robin I’ll be true to thee, 
I’ll love none else but you. 
My heart will ever constant be, 
Dear Robin dear Robin I’ll be true.

2. The sun shines as brightly, the birds sing again, 
The fragrance of flowers fill the air 
While alone in my heart there is sorrow and pain 
O’er my soul hangs the cloud of despair, 
Pretty doves spread your pinions and fly o’er the sea 
Til the bark of my love you o’ertake 
And give him this message yet tell him for me 
To return or my sad heart will break.
