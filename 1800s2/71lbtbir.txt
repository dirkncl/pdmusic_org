1. List, boys, the bell is ringing!
Harken to each silver note,
Hear how sweetly they are sounding,
On the balmy air afloat,
Why do you loiter?
Why do you play?
Haste to the schoolhouse,
Come boys, haste away.

CHORUS [sung after VERSEs 1 & 2]
Why will you wait while the clear bell is ringing now,
And each merry note bids us all to the schoolroom go,
Come awake from your sleep already the hour is at hand,
And we should be there with the others of our happy school band,
And we should be there with the others of our happy school band.

2. List, boys, the bell is calling!
Calling each and ev’ry one,
Come, let’s heed its timely warning,
Let us hasten o’er the lawn,
How sweet and softly
It strikes the ear,
As if t’were saying,
We should not be here.

3. List, boys, the bell is tolling!
Come at once be on the way,
Don’t insist upon this idling,
Not a moment more delay,
Wake from your slumber
Don’t break the rule,
By being absent
Or tardy at school.
