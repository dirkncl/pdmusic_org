1. Who's that sitting in the old armchair,
White cap resting opn the soft, grey hair?
Some one's darling in her arms held fast,
Sweet lips telling of the days long past.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Rock, rock, rocking, and its
Rock, rock, rocking, for its
Dear Old Grandma in the old armchair.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Who's that sitting in the old armchair,
White cap resting in the soft, grey hair?
Rock, rock, rocking, and its
Rock, rock, rocking, for its
Dear old Grandma in the old armchair.

2. See that sparkle in her eyes so blue,
That's just showing where the love shines through;
See that tear that on her bright cheek glows,
That's just telling how her heart o'erflows.
