1. They had talked of coming homeward,
Looking forward to the time,
As the songbirds of the forest,
Plume their wings for sunnier clime;
Weigh the anchor;
Spread the canvass
Homeward! homeward is the cry
And the hope that lit their faces,
Left no shadow on goodbye.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Weigh the anchor, spread the canvass,
Homeward! homeward! is the cry
And the hope that lit their faces,
Left no shadow on goodbye!

2. Mem’ry bridged the mighty ocean,
Sought out ev’ry home and hearth,
Kindling many a household alter,
With a flame of heav’nly birth,
Swift of wing the vessel bore them
Onward o’er the sparkling foam.
Wave on wave with rippling music,
Joining in their welcome home.

3. As a bird intent on heaven,
Reels and wrestles with the dart,
That has seized him as the moment
Hope had triumphed in his heart
So through heart of  oak thus wounded
In rushed sorrow and dismay
Home they sought was dim and distant,
Heav’n was not so far away.

4. Close, ye waves, above our dear ones,
Bravest hearts have direst doom,
And the ocean free and fearless
Well may be the heroes tomb
None can see the leveled furrows,
Where the dead are laid apart
But we know our place of sorrow,
By the scar upon the heart.
