1. Grandmother’s face is wrinkled,
And her eyes have grown so dim, 
That she can not read her Bible,
Nor follow thro’ the hymn,
And her hands are often idle,
For kniting tires them so,
But her brain is always busy
With thoughts of heav’n I know.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
She’s waiting, waiting
(Grandmother’s waiting, Grandmother’s waiting)
To hear God’s summons (summons given) given,
And dreaming of her dear ones,
Gone o’er the hills to heaven.

2. Sometimes I think I see her,
When her heart has done with care,
At the gates of God’s white city,
As she knocks for entrance there;
There she meets her loved ones’ kisses,
And hears them softly say,
“We have waited long thy coming,
For this happy, happy day!”

3. Sometimes I think she sees them
As I watch her dreamy smiles,
And I hear her whisper softly
“Wait but a little while,”
Just a little time of waiting
Beneath life’s sunset skies,
Then the welcome of her dear ones
On the hills of Paradise.
