1.
Rock-a-by baby upon the tree top, 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock,  
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, 
Down comes the cradle with baby and all. 
Rock-a-by baby upon the tree top, 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock. 
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, 
Down comes the cradle with baby and all.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Rock-a-by baby upon the tree top, 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock, 
When the bough breaks the crad-le will fall, 
Down comes the cradle with baby and all. 
Lullaby baby upon the tree top. 
When the wind blows the cradle will rock. 
Will rock. Will rock.

2.
Cradle’s not empty and baby’s not gone, 
If he were not here home would be lone, 
Sweet little mouth and bright sparkling eyes, 
Fill home with music sweet, e’en through the cries. 
Golden hair’d darling, our hearts would be sore 
If you should fly to the bright golden shore. 
Now precious angel fold your bright wings, 
List to the lullaby Mamma now sings.
