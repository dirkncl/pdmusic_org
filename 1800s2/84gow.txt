1. Granny O’Reilly liv’d in a palace, 
On the bogs of Barrymore; 
You could put your hand down thro’ the roof, 
And open the parlor door! 
Old Granny was an honest dame, 
She’d pigs, and hens, and goats; 
From a knothole in McClosky’s barn, 
She borrow’d all her oats! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
But oh! we had such _lots_ of drink, 
And all for friendship’s sake, 
And the boys and girls had _so much_ fun! 
At Granny O’Reilly’s Wake.

2. And, Granny she was neat and trim,
As a piece of brand-new silk,--
For she always hung her night-cap up,
Just after she strain'd the milk!
But when at last old Granny died,
They "laid her out" so neat:
With a "Rob-Roy" shawl around her head,
And brogans on her feet.

3. Then poor old Granny was "laid out"
Behind the kitchen door,
And when they brought the coffin in,
They say it on the floor.
Said Mary Ann O'Reilly "Now,
I'll tell ye's waht to do:--
Come, now, fall on your knees, you marc'less bastes,
And pray ould Granny thro'!

4. And then we bow'd our heads and cried,
And would no com-fort take!
'Till some-one said "Let's take a drink!
All for poor Granny's sake."
And when they all had eat a bit,
And each had got a sup,--
Pat Rooney held Mike Duffy while
He screw'd the coffin up!

5. Then to the Burying-ground we rode,
All in such splendid style!
And we didn't leave a sould behind,--
No, never a mother's child!
We laid her then, quite gently, in
Her deep and narrow bed;
And many a houl, and many a groan,
And many a tear we shed.

6. But what do you think, when we got home,
We saw behind the door!
But old Granny O'Reilly, all laid out,
Where she had lain before!
Some said "why, its old Granny's ghost!"
They all began to shout!
But sure we'd burried the coffin up!--
And left old Granny out!
