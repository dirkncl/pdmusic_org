There sat one day in quiet, 
By an alehouse on the Rhine, 
Four hale and hearty fellows, 
And drank the precious wine, 
The Landlord’s daughter fill’d their cups, 
Around the rustle board: 
Then sat they all so calm and still, 
And spake not one rude word. 
But when the maid departed. 
A Swa bian raised his hand. 
And cried all hot and flush’d with wine, 
“Long live the Swabian land! 
Long live the Swabian land! 
The greatest kingdom  upon this earth 
Cannot with that, cannot with that compare; 
With all the stout and hardy men 
And the nutbrown maidens there, 
And the nutbrown maidens there? 
“Ha! Ha!” cried a Saxon, laughing. 
And dash’d his beard with wine: 
I’d rather live in Lapland, 
Than that Swabian land of thine! 
The goodliest land on all this earth. 
It is the Saxon land! 
There have I as many maidens, 
As fingers on this hand! 
Yes, the goodliest land on all the earth. 
It is the Saxon land! 
It is the Saxon land! 
Hold your tongues! 
Hold your tonges! 
Hold your tongues! both Swabian and Saxon!” 
A bold Bohemian cries, 
A bold Bohemian cries: 
“If there’s a heav’n, a heaven upon this earth, 
It in Behemia lies. 
There the tailor blows the flute. 
And the cobler blows the horn. 
And the minor blows the bugle over mountain gorge and bourn. 
And the tailor blows his flute. 
And the cobler blows his horn. 
And the miner blows the bugle over mountain gorge and bourn. 
And then the Landlord’s Daughter 
Up to heaven rais’d her hand. 
And said, “Ye may no more contend, 
There lies the happiest land. 
There there lies the happiest, 
There lies the happiest land. 
There, there lies the happiest land.”
