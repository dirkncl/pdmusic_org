1. Oh, tell me little spark of life,
Far off in yonder sky:
Canst thou discern me where thou art,
With thy bright twinkling eye?
If thou hast power to gaze on me.
Pray search my lady fair,
And tell me where on earth she dwells,
And kindly guide me there,
  And tell me where on earth she dwells,
  And kindly guide me there.

2. Oh tell me little spark of life,
Far off in yonder sky;
Art thou a spirit which can know
The thoughts that buried lie?
And canst thou not in slumber deep
Some truth in dreams impart,
Ah, then in tones of truest love,
Make known to her my heart,
  Ah, then in tones of truest love,
  Make known to her my heart.
