1. In the chimney corner,
Stands a cushioned chair,
Hallowed by a hundred thousand tears;
Where at evening twilight,
Clustered round in pray’r,
Oft we met for many, many years,
If you’d know the secret I fain will have to tell you
Why that treasured prize we guard with care;
Grandma always sat there,
In the long ago;
Sacred spot is Grandma’s vacant chair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
In the chimney corner, 
By the glowing fire,
Oft I’ve lisped my little evening prayer,
Mem’ry’s recolection,
Tears of love inspire,
Sacred spot is Grandma’s vacant chair.

2. In the chimney corner,
By the glowing fire,
Grandma always sat from morn till night;
And her nimble fingers
Never seem’d to tire,
Knitting by the candles flick’ring light,
Silv’ry was her hair and her face was full of wrinkles,
Yet her smile would banish ev’ry care;
Now the place is cheerless,
Grandma’s gone to rest;
Sacred spot is Grandma’s vacant chair.
