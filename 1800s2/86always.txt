1. Shall you weary of me, darling,
  When my cheek has lost its bloom?
When the sunlight of life’s morning
  Deepens into ev’ning’s gloom?
Shall you turn to me for comfort
  As today you love to do?
Shall I always be the dearest
  And the fairest one to you?

CHORUS {ad libutum) [sung after each VERSE]
Time is brief, alas! my darling,
And our youth with age will blend,
But the love that’s true and tender
Shall endure unto the end!

2. Shall you weary of me, darling?
  Shall I always bring you peace?
Shall I ever prove your helper
  When the woes of life increase?
Will you trust me, wholly trust me,
  Through all sorrow, pain and strife?
Shall I lighten ev’ry burden,
  Shall I glorify your life?

3. Shall you weary of me, darling?
  Shall you look to me for strength—
When the Springtime glow has vanish’d,
  And the Winter comes at length?
Shall I bring you rest and gladness
  When my youth and beauty fade?
As you’ve loved me in the sunlight,
  Will you love me in the shade?

4. Shall you weary of me darling,
  When life’s sun is nearly set?
Shall you cling to me forever
  And be thankful that we met?
Shall you want me close beside you
  When all earthly joys grow dim?
Shall you wait for me and greet me
  If you journey first to Him?
