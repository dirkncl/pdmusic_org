1. I’m a light hearted Paddy,
A rale Irish laddy,
I came to this country
Strange wonders to say,
I sailed from dear Cork,
For the port of New York,
I was eighteen long days,
A crossing the say,
When I arrived in the land,
I was tuck by the hand,
By a blaggard who said,
“Paddy come go with me,
I will show you the city,
The sights are so pretty.”
He says, “what’s your name?” says I “Tim Flaherty.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I’m Tim Flaherty,
Arah gaze upon me.
A light hearted paddy
Is Tim Flaherty.

2. He showed me around,
The sights were soon found,
I viewed them with wonder,
And astonishment,
When he bade me good bye,
Tears came in my eye,
I found he’d been through me
And took ivry cint.
What to do, didn’t know,
Where was I to go;
So I wint to the coort,
And explained to the Judge.
He called me a pauper,
A vagrant, and loafer,
And give me six months in the Island above.
