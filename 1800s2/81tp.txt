[1st Soprano]
A Picnic we must have right soon, 
from early morn till rise of moon 
it must be near the water, 
in a grove near the water, 
with some boats, to go a sailing, 
with some boats, to go a sailing, 
so it must be near the water, 
in a grove, yes! but near the water. 

[Alto]
You wish to go a sailing with the boys? 

[2nd Soprano]
with the boys, with the boys!

[Alto]
so a picnic near the water is your choice!

[2nd Soprano]
is your choice, is your choice?

[Alto]
And we my dear?

[2nd Soprano]
We ententain mean while the dear old folks on shore!

[Overlapping voices]
[1st Soprano]
Yes, entertain the old folks on shore
[2nd Soprano and Alto]
Say why my dearest, and wherefore?

[1st Soprano]
We'll all go sailing with the boys,
so near the water is my choice,
while in the grove the old folks
kind refreshments will provide.

[SSA]
We'll all go sailing with the boys,
so near the water is our choice,
while in the grove, the old folks
kind refreshments will provide.
for they were young themselves once,
for they were young themselves once,
and know how 'tis, when boys and girls together
go a sailing, go a sailing, go a sailing.
We'll all go sailing with the boys,
so near the water is our choice,
while in the grove, the old folks
kind refreshments will provide.

[1st Soprano]
Dick, John and Clarence we'll invite,

[2nd Soprano]
Spencer and Hugh and Bobby White,

[Alto]
Bertha, Anna, and Mary Rupples with us
make just exactly six couples.

[1st Soprano]
All right! but Caroline Cotton
and Peter Paul Totten
you have quite forgotten,
and Charlie and Bettie
they have heard of our picnic already!

[2nd Soprano and Alto]
How numerous we get!
they'll be plenty of fun,
yes plenty of fun, you bet!

[Alto]
Now let us write the invitation,

[2nd Soprano]
Yes! but where's to be the plenie?

[Alto]
Why, in the grove near Chester Station,
Quite a club like that of Pickwick!

[1st Soprano and Alto]
Oh! won't there be clutter of dishes and tongues,
and such funny plays and beautiful songs
and all that to a merry company belongs,

[2nd Soprano]
and when we've laugh'd and joked our fill;
and cleared off the goodies with hearty goodwill,
and don't know what else, what else to do

[SSA]
Then we'll go sailing with the boys,
go near the water is our choice,
while in the grove that old folks kind
are left while behindm
yes, near the water is our choice,
to go a sailing with the boys!
