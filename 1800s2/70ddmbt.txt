1. My mother kissed me at the door,
While sister said goodbye;
And mother’s voice was soft and low,
A teardrop in her eye;
She said you go with comrades gay,
Out in the world so bright,
But one request I have to make,
Don’t drink, don’t drink my boy tonight.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]]
Don’t drink my boy tonight,
Don’t drink my boy tonight,
I cannot yet those words forget,
Don’t drink my boy tonight,
I cannot yet those words forget,
Don’t drink, don’t drink my boy tonight.

2. Since then long years have passed away,
My jetty locks are white;
But the loving warning of that day,
Have nev er taken flight;
I still can see her gentle face,
Though buried out of sight,
And hear her soft voice murmuring,
Don’t drink, don’t drink my boy tonight.

3. Dear mother’s resting sweetly now,
Beneath the willow’s shade.
The warning given me that night,
Will ne’er from mem’ry fade;
Oh! Mother would you have your boy,
To walk in paths of right,
Then say as none but you can say,
Don’t drink, don’t drink my boy  tonight.
