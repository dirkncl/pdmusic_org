1. You will miss me darling, Chloe,  when I sleep beneath the sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm’ring o’er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life’s weary road you plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrow free; 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I died, 
And you’ll miss me, Chloe, when I’m laid away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
For old Uncle Tom is feeble, Uncle Tom is feeble, 
And his head is bending low; bending low; 
The Master calls, he can no longer stay— can no longer stay, 
For his 
limbs are getting weary 
([overlapping voices]Old Uncle Tom]) 
and his eyes are growing dim, 
But you’ll miss me, Chloe, when I’m laid away! when I’m laid away! 

2. You will tell our little children that their father dwells above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair. 
You will tell them how I lov’d them, with a fond and sacred love; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the judge his trumpet sounds from realms of bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last. 
I will meet you, darling, Chloe, and together you and I, 
Will no longer dread December’s wintry blast.
