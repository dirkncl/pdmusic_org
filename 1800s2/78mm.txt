1. It was a summer night, 
The moon was shining bright, 
In an attic I was keeping lonely guard. 
I started from my seat, 
A noise I can’t repeat, 
Came rolling to me from the kitchen yard.

CHORUS [sing twice afte each verse]
Meow marrier meow marier, marier marier. 
Your eyes are on fire, 
Meow marier meow marier. 
That’s what I heard the whole of the night.

2. I jumped up in a rage, 
In an aggravated rage, 
And I throw my bootjack at the pesky thing. 
When from another hole, 
A second gently stole, 
While thus in tender voice began to sing.

3. I quickly got a gun, 
I shot and wounded one, 
I saw them with their backs in anger curled. 
Says Tom “Marier dear, 
Let’s split his tarnel ear,” 
This tearing terror both together hurled.

4. In vain I try to sleep, 
All night they at it keep, 
I wonder what in thunder it al means. 
What is it Tommy asks, 
As Miss Marier basks, 
Which makes the sight so hideous with their screams.
