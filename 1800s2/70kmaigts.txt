1. Oh, father, come and sit by me,
And let me take your hand in mine,
And tell me you forgive your boy,
For all, ere he shall life resign;
Dear father, I am growing weak,
I feel that death is coming now,
And yet I know I shall awake,
With mother’s hand upon my brow.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Forgive me father dear, forgive me,
Though I am dying, do not weep;
For I shall go where mother dwells,
So kiss me, and I’ll go to sleep.

2.You’ll put my little toys away,
Please, just as safe as they can be;
And when you see them, father dear,
Oh! will you not remember me?
For I hall go to Heaven now,
Thro’ death’s dark river cold and deep,
The angels beckon me away,
So kiss me and I’ll go to sleep.

3.And when my little playmates come,
To see me laid within the tomb,
Tell them I went to that bright land,
Where sin and sorrow never come;
And, father, when you are alone,
My spirit near will ever keep,
I’ll lead you to the Heav’mly throne,
Now kiss me and I’ll go to sleep.
