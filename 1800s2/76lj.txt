1.
We miss her pretty childlsh talk,
Her footstep on the stair;
We miss her in our daily walk,
We miss her ev'ry where;
We cannot choose but weep, altho'
We bow beneath the rod;
The fairest of  our flock, we know;
Has gone to meet her God;

[sung after each verse]
[REFRAIN]
We dare not wish her back again,
Our little angel child,
Though in our hearts a dull, sad pain,
Beats, with a throbbing wild.
CHORUS
We dare not wish her back again,
Our little angel child,
Though in our hearts a dull, sad pain,
Beats, with a throbbing wild.

2.
But nature, will assert her away,
The unhidden tears will flow,
As we think on ev'ry winning way
Of our darling long ago,
When she came to bless our pretty home,
First little nestling there,
Ah! blame me not if the tears still come,
For we miss her ev'ry where,
