1.
Across the far blue hills Marie,
The mellow moon looks wistfully,
And folds us lingering sadly here,
The last, last time for many a year,
The last, last time for many a year,
Farewell, farewell I pass from thee,
Across the sad hills love Marie,
Farewell, farewell I pass from thee,
Across the sad hills love Marie, Marie, Marie. 

2.
Across the far blue hills Marie,
The same sweet moon shall shine on thee,
When drawing near to this dear place,
With tears upon thy pale sweet face,
With tears upon thy pale sweet face,
Thou’lt yearn and stretch sad hands for me,
Across the sad hills lone Marie,
Thou’lt yearn and stretch sad hands for me,
Across the sad hills love Marie, Marie, Marie. 

3.
Across the happy hills Marie,
With joyous step I come to thee,
The years of parting all are o’er.
We twain shall part on earth no more,
We twain shall part on earth no more,
Come forth, come forth to welcome me,
Across the happy hills Marie,
Come forth, come forth to welcome me,
Across the happy hills Marie, Marie, Marie.
