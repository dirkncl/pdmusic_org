1.
I'se gwine back to Dixie,--
No more to wander,
My heart's turn'd back to Dixie,--
I can't stay her no longer,--
I miss de ole plantation,
My home and my relation,
My heart's turned back to Dixie,
And I must go.

CHORUS
I'se gwine back to Dixie,
I'se gwine back to Dixie,
I'se gwine where the orange blossoms grow,
For I hear the children calling,
I see their sad tears falling,
My heart's turned back to Dixie,
And I must go.

2.
I've hoed in fields of cotton,
I've work'd upon the river,
I used to think if I got off,
I'd go back there, no, never,
But time has changed the old man,
His head is bending low,
His heart's turned back to Dixie,
And he must go.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'se trav'ling back to Dixie,--
My step is slow and feeble,
I pray the Lord to help me,
And lead me from all evil,
And should my strength forsake me,
Then, kind friends, come and take me,
My heart's turned back to Dixie,
And I must go.

(CHORUS)
