1. The daystar shines upon the hill,
The valleys in the shadows sleep;
In wood and thicket, dark and still,
My comrades lie in slumber deep.
Far in the east a phantom gray
Steals slowly up the night's black pall,
And herald of the coming day,
The distant bugle's soft notes call
“I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,
I can't get 'em up in the morning;
I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,
I can't get 'em up at all.”

2. A thought of motion at the sound,
As though the forest caught its breath,
And belted sleepers on the ground
Move restlessly like life in death
And slumb’ring echoes, here and there,
Awaken as the challenge floats,
And louder on the morning air
Ring out the cheery bugle notes.
“I can't get 'em up in the morning,
I can't get 'em up in the morning,
I can't get 'em up in the morning,
I can't get 'em up at all.”

3. And as the thrilling strains prolong,
Flames into rose and gold the day,
And springing up with shout and song,
Each soldier welcomes march or fray.
"I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up"
Ring out the cheery bugle call,
"I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,
I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up"
Ring out the cheery bugle call.

4. Through wooded vale, o'er windswept hill,
Where campfires gleam and shadows fall,
And louder, clearer, cheerily still,
Ring out the merry bugle call.
"I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,
I can't get 'em up in the morning;
I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,
I can't get 'em up at all."
