1. Ah! rich is the gleam of the gem from afar, 
And bright is the blaze of the silverlit star; 
But richer and brighter the light that I prize, 
That lighted my boyhood, from Grandmother’s eyes. 
’Twas wisdom and charity mingled in one, 
While gentleness gilded the radiant throne. 
And proud, bitter anger could never surprise, 
The calm, placid glow of my Grandmother’s Eyes. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh rich is the gleam of the gem from afar, 
And bright is the blaze of the silverlit star, 
But richer and brighter the light that I prize, 
That lighted my childhood from Grandmother’s eyes, 
Grandmother’s eyes, Grandmother’s eyes, 
But richer and clearer the light that I prize 
That lighted my childhood from Grandmother’s eyes.

2. If weary with playing, my heavy feet pained,
If dull drooping eyelids with weeping were stained,
When sorrow o’er clouded my juvenile skies,
Loved sympathy flowed from my Grandmother’s eyes.
Some sweet smiling fairy with wonderful gift,
Or grim giant Ogree, the burden would lift,
No balm for young sorrow so soothingly lies,
As love from the light of a Grandmother’s Eyes. 

3. And now with the snow in my once raven hair,
Foretelling of rest from all labor and care,
My thoughts wander back to the spot where she lies
And mem’ry repictures my Grandmother’s eyes.
True solace in childhood, true council when grown,
A lodestar in danger and sorrow they shone;
I long for the summons, that bids to the skies,
Thro’ pathways illumed by my Grandmother’s Eyes.
