1. Go to sleep my baby,
Mama’s always near
To rock your little cradle,
And smooth your golden hair
Papa too bends o’er you,
So baby do not weep,
But close your tired eyes my, darling,
Close them fast in sleep,
In the morning when you waken,
Grass will shine with dew,
You will hear the churchbells ringing
Ringing love for you.

2. I will pray the Father,
Him who reigns above,
To hover always near you,
To guard you with his love
Sent to us from Heaven,
A blessing you have been,
And may your feet ne’er wander,
From the path that leads to Him,
And to God our Heav’nly Father,
Fervent thanks I’ll give,
For our darling baby treasure,
In whose smile I live.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE (with overlapping voices)]
[Soprano]
When the little birds are singing,
and your hear the church bells ringing,
Ringing out for my darling and you,
O’er the hills the sun is climbing,
on your golden locks are shining,
Open then your honey eyes of blue.
[Alto, Tenor, Bass]
Birds are singing, church bells ringing,
Sun is climbing,
Locks are shining,
Open of blue.
