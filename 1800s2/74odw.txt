1.
My old misses promised me,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
When she died she'd set me free,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,

She did live till she got bald,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
And she never died at all,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye.

CHORUS
Den Oh, dat watermelon,
  Lamb of goodness, you must die.
I'm gwine to join de contraband children,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye.
Oh, dat watermelon,
  Lamb of goodness, you must die.
I'm gwine to join de contraband children,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,

2.
Shoo fly cut a pigun wing,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
Rattle snake rolled in a 'possumm's skin,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,

Cow path crooked gwine frough de wood,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
Misses ses I shan't, I ses I should,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye.

(CHORUS)

3.
Sister Sue, and old aunt Sal,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
Both lived down in Shinbone al,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,

Name of de house, name on de door,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye,
Big green spot on de Grocery store,
  Gwine to git a home bye and bye.

(CHORUS)
