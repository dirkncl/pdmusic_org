1.
On the loftiest branch of an old pine tree, 
A Crow had her nest with her blue eggs three; 
Far and wide o’er the plain I’ll be heard, said she, 
And the world shall know of my song and me, 
And the world shall know of my song and me. 
But the northwind’s breath lays the old tree low, 
And that was the last of the eggs and the crow. 
Build your nest low and let the winds blow, 
The heaven look brightest to those down below. 
Build your nest low 
And let the winds blow! 
Let the winds blow! 

2.
In a low, grassy vale the Lark builds her nest, 
The dew of the morning lies cool on her breast, 
Upward she springs with the first dawn of light, 
And pours our her soul in a song of delight, 
Saluting the morn in her pray’r for the sun, 
And returning in joy that her pray’r has been won, 
And returning in joy that her pray’r has been won. 
Build your nest low and let the winds blow. 
The Lark leas a loftier life that the Crow. 
Build your nest low, 
And let the winds blow! 
Let the winds blow!
