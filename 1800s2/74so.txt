1.
Monkey dress'd in soldier clothes,
  All cross over to Jordan,
Went out in de woods to drill some crows,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

Jay bird sat on a hickory limb,
  All cross over to Jordan,
I up with a rock and hit him on the shin,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

CHORUS 2 times
Shine on, Shine on,
  All cross over to Jordan.
Shine on, Shine on,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

2.
Make dat coffee good and brown,
  All cross over to Jordan,
Turn dat hoecake round and round,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

A for Adam, P for Paul,
  All cross over to Jordan,
G for gentle, great and small,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

(CHORUS)

3.
My old master liv'd in clover,
  All cross over to Jordan,
When he died he rolled right over,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

He rolled his eyes, gave one long breath,
  All cross over to Jordan,
He scared these niggers half to death,
  Oh! Jerusalem.

(CHORUS)
