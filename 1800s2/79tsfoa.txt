1. ’Tis down beside the river, 
That sings a merry tune, 
I love to wander ever, 
’Neath skies of blushing June. 
For there I often meet her,— 
The girl I love so well, 
The sweettest rose, that ever grows, 
Her name I’ll never tell. 
All among the blossoms, 
On a happy summer day, 
List’ning to the robins, 
All alone we stray; 
All among the lilybells, 
and daisies bright and small, 
There I meet my little rosebud, 
she’s the sweetest flow’r of all! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
We talk of love all day, 
Among the roses fair; 
The flow’ rets sigh, as she goes by, 
The happy robins call; 
Oh, lilies dipp’d in dew; 
And pansies, too, are there, 
But none so sweet, as one I meet, 
The sweetest flow’r of all!

2. Her name you may be guessing, 
Her smile is like the day,— 
The fondest love expressing,— 
Her voice is like the May; 
The bright and blushing roses, 
They envy her I know, 
She’s in their dreams, when starlight beams, 
And in my dreams also. 
Where the bee is roving, 
In the starlight golden sweet, 
There she gave her promise, 
Making life complete; 
There she said she would be mine, 
ere summer days shall fall, 
Dearest little brightest treasure, 
she’s the sweettest flow’r of all!
