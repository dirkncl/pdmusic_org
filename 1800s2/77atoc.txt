1. I’m thinking now of one dark night, 
I rambled on the street; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright, 
The police on their beat. 
Should I relate just all I saw, 
Perchance your nerves I’d shock, 
For fearful are the sights we see, 
Each night past twelve o’ clock! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Come roam the city round with me, 
Perchance your nerves ’twill shock, 
For fearful are the sights you see, 
Each night past twelve o’ clock!

2. Now first I saw a lab’ring man, 
While passing thro a lane; 
His wages he was giving fast, 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, tho’ she was starv’d, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
Just after twelve o’ clock! 

3. And then there was another scene, 
I think it has been told, 
I saw a man escape from jail, 
The guards were bought  with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock; 
And who can tell where this man went, 
Just after twelve o’ clock! 

4. Now soon I reached the river’s side,
And paused there for a rest;
’Twas there I saw a poor young girl,
Her babe clasped to her breast:
Her marriage was a mockery—
She jumped out from the dock—
A shriek! a splash! the waves rolled on—
Just after twelve o’ clock!
