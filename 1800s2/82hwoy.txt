1. A youth and a maiden, had trustfully laden,
With flow’rets of virtue, of virtue and truth,
Their boat light and airy which danced like a fairy,
Upon the bright streamlet, the bright streamlet of youth.
But far on the river, their shallop did quiver,
And tremble when came the dark night, the dark night,
’Till a voice ful of love, whisper’d down from above,

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
“Heaven watches you, all will be right,” said a voice from above,
“Heaven watches you, all will be right, yes, all will be right.”

2. Then full  of devotion, they sail’d o’er the ocean,
That roll’d its great waves, its waves at their feet,
While still the bright flowers, were as sweet as the bowers,
Where virtue, where virtue and happiness meet.
When clouds hover o’er them, they look’d before them,
And saw but the glad radiant light, radiant light,
Still they heard the same voice whisper gently rejoice,

3. The skies became lighter, the flow’rets were brighter,
And shed their sweet fragrence, their fragrance around,
Their hearts were still youthful, their souls pure and truthful,
For joy and contentment, sweet contentment they found.
Yet onward, still sailing, their courage ne’er failing,
They cam to a home pure and bright, pure and bright,
While o’er them winging, they heard angels singing,
