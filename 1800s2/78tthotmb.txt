1. To thy heart O take me back! 
For thy face I sadly miss, 
Let me fold you in my arms, 
Once again those lips to kiss. 
Flow’rs may come, the birds may sing 
E’en their softest sweetest strain, 
But their is no joy for me 
Lest you take me back again, 
But there is no joy for me 
Lest you take me back again.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O! my soul is crush’d with grief, 
Sick and sad and fill’d with pain, 
All the joys of earth are fled; 
Take O take me back again.

2. To thy heart O take me back! 
Let me see that tender smile 
In its radiance soft and sweet 
All the passing hours beguile. 
Like the Spring to gloomy hearts; 
As to flow’rs the cheering rain; 
So for thee my spirit calls; 
Take, O take me back again, 
So for thee my spirit calls; 
Take, O take me back again.

3. To thy heart O take me back! 
Cheer me o’er life’s stormy way, 
Tho’ my path be drear and dark 
All will be as bright as day. 
O! my soul is crush’d with grief, 
Sick and sad and fill’d with pain, 
All the joys of earth are fled; 
Take, O take me back again, 
All the joys of earth are fled; 
Take, O take me back again.
