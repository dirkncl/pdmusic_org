1.
I'se trabling back to Georgia,
Dat good ole land to see,
The place I left to wander,
The day that I was free.
I'se getting old and weary
And tired of roaming too,
So on my way to Dixie,
I'll say goodbye to you.

CHORUS
I'se trabling back,
Yes, trabling back,
I'se trabling night and day,
I'se trabling back to Georgia,
I'se trabling night and day,
I'se trabling back to Georgia,
For I cannot keep away.

2.
I'se trabling back to Georgia,
The place where I was born,
Among the fields of cotton,
The sugar cane and corn.
So happy with old Massa
A living in the lane,
To see de ole plantation
I'se trabling back again.

(CHORUS)

3.
To live and die in Georgia,
Dats good enough for me,
I'll hoe the corn and cotton,
And Oh so happy be.
I'll hunt the coon and possom
And dance and sing and play,
And when I once get back there
I'll never come away.

(CHORUS)

4.
I'se trabling back to Georgia
To see the darkies there,
And see my old Aunt Dinah,
Oh golly won't she stare!
We'll dance all night till morning
By the bano's sweet refrain,
And have a celebration
When I get back again.

(CHORUS)
