"Cheerily carols the lark over the cot" (1887)
Words by William Schwenck Gilbert, 1836-1911
Music by Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan, 1842-1900
from "Ruddigore; or, The Witches Curse"

Cheerily carols the lark
Over the cot.
Merrily whistles the clerk,
Scratching a blot.
But the lark
And the clerk,
I remark,
Comfort me not!

Over the ripening peach
Buzzes the bee.
Splash on the billowy beach
Tumbles the sea.
But the peach
And the beach,
They are each
Nothing to me!

And why?
Who am I?
Daft Madge!
Crazy Meg!
Mad Margaret!
Poor Peg!

(Chuckling.) He! he! he!

Mad, I?
Yes, very!
But why?
Mystery!
Don't call!
No crime---
'Tis only
That I'm love-lonely!
That's all!

1.
To a garden full of posies
Cometh one to gather flowers,
And he wanders through its bowers
Toying with the wanton roses, the wanton roses,
Who, uprising from their beds,
Hold on high their shameless heads
With their pretty lips apouting,
With their pretty lips apouting,
Never doubting---never doubting
That for Cytherean posies
He would gather aught but roses!

2.
In a nest of weeds and nettles,
Lay a violet, half-hidden,
Hoping that his glance unbidden
Yet might fall upon her petals, upon her petals,
Though she lived alone, apart,
Hope lay nestling at her heart,
But, alas, the cruel awaking---
But, alas, the cruel awaking
Set her little heart a-breaking,
For he gather'd for his posies
Only roses---only roses!
