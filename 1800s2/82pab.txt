1. When you come from your work in the ev’ning, 
And the little ones climb on your knee, 
You laugh at the stories they tell you, 
As full of their fun as can be.
And perhaps there’s a face in the corner, 
With a pair of bright eyes open wide, 
And you see a wee roque, all dimples, 
Just trying her best to hide.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
Trying to hide from me!
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
Two little eyes I see, now take care!
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
Two little eyes I see, now take care!
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
Hiding ev’ry where, 
On the floor, 
By the door, 
Now I’m coming there.

2. Then you catch the wee rogue, and you kiss her, 
As you hold her so close to your heart, 
And you think how much you would miss her, 
If ever from her you should part, 
Then away she goes, laughing and shouting, 
And a kiss she is throwing to you, 
And behind the door she’s standing, 
To hear you say peekaboo!
