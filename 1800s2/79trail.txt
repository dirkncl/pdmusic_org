1. ’Tis merry, merry Christmas,
I wish ye love and joy,
Ev’ry father, ev’ry mother,
Ev’ry young girl, ev’ry boy,
Good eating and good drinking
I wish ye ev’ry one,
Then hang the babies’s stocking up
For Santa Claus has come.

1st Cho. Oh yes, I have a jumping jack,
Jumping jack, a jumping jack,
Oh yes, I have a jumping jack,
For any baby dear.

[sung after each CHORUS]
Then hang the babies’ stocking up,
Stocking up, the stocking up,
Oh hang the babies’s stocking up,
For Santa Claus has come.
turiadilum, turiadilum,
turiadilum day.

2. ’Tis merry, merry Christmas,
Oh, see the falling snow!
Little children, sweetly singing,
Let’s be happy, banish woe;
Fat turkeys and plum pudding,
I wish ye ev’ry one;
Then hang the babies’ stocking up,
For Santa Claus has come.

2d Cho. Oh yes, I have a cricket, oh!
Cricket oh! a cricket oh!
Oh yes, I have a cricket oh!
For any baby dear.

3. A merry, merry Christmas,
To you, dear ladies all;
Ev’ry old maid, ev’ry beauty,
In a sealskin or a shawl;
Go merry, do not tarry,
I tell you ev’ry one,
Then hang the babies’ stocking up,
For Santa Claus has come.

3d Cho. Oh yes, I have a springing ball,
Springing ball, a springing ball,
Oh yes, I have a springing ball,
For any baby dear.

4. Among the poor and lowly,
This blessed Christmas day,
Go ye mingle, money jingle,
For to aid them on their way.
More power to the dower
You give to every one,
Then hang the babies’ stocking up,
For Santa Claus has come.

4th Cho. Oh yes, I have a little doll,
Little doll, a little doll,
Oh yes, I have a little doll
For any baby dear.

5. ’Tis merry, merry Christmas,
Oh, shout it with a will!
In the country, in the city,
From the mountain, from the hill.
May blessings never lessen
On each and every one,
Then hang the babies’s stocking up,
For Santa Claus has come.

5th Cho. yes, I have a bugle oh!
Bugle oh! a bugle oh!
Oh yes, I have a bugle oh!
For any baby dear.
