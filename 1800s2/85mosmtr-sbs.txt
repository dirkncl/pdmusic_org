Mother! oh, sing me to rest,
As in my bright days departed,
Sing to thy child the sickhearted,
Songs for a spirit oppress’d.
Lay this tired head on thy breast!
Flowers from the nightdew are closing,
Pilgrims and mourners reposing:
Mother! oh, sing me to rest.
Take back thy bird to its nest!
[CHORUS]
Take back thy bird to its nest!
Weary is young life when blighted
Heavy this love unrequited,
Mother, oh, sing me to rest;
Mother, oh, sing me to rest!
