Come away, come away, 
Oh! come where the silv’ry waves break. 
Oh, come, oh, come, 
There’s moonlight on the lake; 

There’s moonlight on the lake. 
The sun has gone to rest. 
The birds have called their loved, 
have called their loved ones to their nest. 

Up on the banks we meet,
Our boat the ripples breaks,
Our hearts are filled with joy
for now there's moonlight on the lake.

Come away, come away, 
Oh! come where the silv’ry waves break. 
Oh, come, oh, come, 
There’s moonlight on the lake; 
Moonlight on the lake, moonlight on the lake.
Our boat, our boat the wavelets break,
And our hearts are fill'd with joy.
To see the moonlight on the lake, upon the lake.

Come away, come away,
Oh! come when the silv'ry waves break,
Oh! come, oh come, there's moonlight on the lake;
Yes, come, yes, come, yes, come, yes, come.
