1. When thy footsteps falter, love,
  In the future’s twilight years,
And the silvered light of age,
  On thy golden head appears,
Then, my darling, then the while,
  I shall love thy gentle smile,
Tho’ the dimples must give place,
  To the lines which time shall trace.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Growing old together love,
  We shall see the shining goal,
While for us life’s evening bells,
  Shall in sweetest cadence toll.

2. When thy hand shall trembling lie,
  On my arm in lov’d embrace,
And the years thy form shall rob,
  Of its youthful charms and grace,
Them my darling age shall bring,
  Charms which round thy life shall cling,
And affection stronger grow,
  With the future’s weal or woe.

3. Growing old together love,
  We shall know no changes drear,
For, the heart shall youthful be,
  When life’s wintry days are here,
We shall see the closing ray,
  Of our last declining day,
Drop in splendor from the sky,
  Bringing that “sweet bye and bye.”
