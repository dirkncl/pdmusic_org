1.
Sweet visions of childhood! how bright they appear
When our lives are o'erclouded with care;
How fondly we dream of them, year after year,
And how lovely they are, and how fair!
Oh  bless'd are the scenes that I ne'er can forget:
Dearest mother so kind and so true;
Sweet home that I left with the saddest regret,
How my heart fondly turns unto you!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now,
And I weep for the days that are past;
My fond mother's kiss, and her hand on my brow,
In the days that were too bright to last!

2.
Sweet visions of childhood! how dear to each heart,
Once a-gain by a fair mother's knee
I linger while fast welling tears fondly start,
And the past comes in beauty to me!
Oh time may destroy all the bright joy of life,
But this bosom will ever retain,
Lovely visions of thee, mid the world's busy strife,
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again!
