1. 
Up mountain heights in soft Italian weather
our journey lies (our journey lies) 
Hark how with lusty throats in Voice together
Each trav’ler cries (Each trav’ler cries) 
One mystic word above the rest is rising
the cry “Jammo” (the cry “Jammo”) 
Which stirs the native heart with zest surprising
come let us go (Come let us go) 

SOLO [sung after each verse
Jammo Jammo Onward let us go 
Jammo Jammo Upward let us go 
funiculi funicula funiculi funicula 
Ncoppa jammo ja “funiculi” “funicula” 

CHORUS [sung after each SOLO]
Jammo Jammo Onward let us go 
Jammo Jammo upward let us go 
funiculi funicula funiculi funicula 
Ncoppa jammo ja funiculi funicula

====
(Neopolitan) Ais se ra naunne me ne sa gliette 
tu sa ie addo (tu saie addo)
Addo Stoco re ngrato chiu dispiette 
far me non po (far ne non po) 
Ad do     llo fuoco coce ma is fuie 
te las sasta (te las sasta) 
Enon te correap pries so non te struje 
sulo a guarda (sulo a guarda) 

SOLO
Jammo Jammo ncop pa jammo ja

2.
This is the touchstone of their earnest feeling
the note to thrill (the note to thrill) 
Which Every hidden energy revealing
Incites the will (Incites the will) 
And as up steepest heights they bravely travel 
So through their life (So through their life) 
With cry “Jammo” it’s mazes they unravel 
with eager strife (with eager strife)

3.
O sunny skies that gleam in glorious Splendor 
in realms above (in realms above) 
Ye know the passion of the  heart grows tender 
With fervent love (With fervent love) 
Up to your heights the soul to win it’s treasure 
Still strives to go (Still strives to go) 
And with a stirring and a nameless pleasure 
it cries “Jammo” (it cries Jammo)
