1. Out from the echoes of the past,
  Let freedom’s glorious song.
Swell thro’ the grand old collonade,
  A hundred years made strong;
We’ve reared a temple proud and high,
  Rough hewn and weak at first
As when from dark oppressions gloom,
  It’s infant glory burst.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We gather from the East and West,
  Where Freedom’s glory cheers,
While North and South, with pride unite,
  To crown this hundred years.

2. Our fathers broke the cruel chains
  Of hateful Tyranny,
And planted in the wilderness,
  The ensign of the free,
They fought and bled, their gallant deeds,
  Today in fadeless hue
Are written on the stripes of red,
  And graven on the blue.

3. From Nature’s hiddenstore house deep
  Vast wealth to us appears,
No other land can boast so much,
  All in a hundred years,
Our husband men, from east, to west
  Find liberty and health.
They sow the fertile fields and reap,
  Abundant source of wealth.

4. Let other nations boast their thrones,
  Their crowns and sceptres rare;
We each are sovereigns here today,
  And freedom’s crown we wear;
We will not bow to titled rule,
  For Royalty’s outdone;
We know no rank of wealth or blood,
  The people here are one.

5. Lift up the banner! shout aloud!
  Till every nation hears,
What Liberty for us has done,
  All in a hundred years;
To God above our thanks are due,
  For freedom’s holy light,
We lift our hearts in gratitude,
  And praise Him for the right.
