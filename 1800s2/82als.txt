My faint spirit was sitting 
in the light of thy looks, my love; 
It panted for thee like the bird at noon, 
For the brooks, the brooks, my love. 
Thy barb, whose hoofs outspeed the tempest’s flight, 
Bore thee far from me; 
My heart, for my weak feet were weary soon, 
Did companion thee 
Ah! fleeter far than the fleetest storm or steed, 
Or the death they bear, 
The heart which tender thought clothes 
like a dove with the wings, the wings of care 
In the battle, in the darkness, in the need, 
shall mine cling to thee, 
nor claim one smile for all the comfort, love 
it may bring to thee, may bring to thee, to thee.
