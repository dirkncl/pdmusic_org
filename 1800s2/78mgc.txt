1.
There's an old home I know far away,
In the land where the orange tree grows,
Where the nightingale warbles his lay
To the lily and beautiful rose.

In that home I no longer may see,
Stands the clock of my grandmother dear;
Its wheels still move on true and free,
And its old bell still rings loud and clear.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Tick on, [tick on,] dear old friend of my heart,
Thy warning I'll never forget;
I'll watch the swift seconds depart,
And hear the old bell chiming yet.

2.
It was here that my grandmother dwelt,
And here the sweet songs that she sang,
Round the altar the family knelt,
As the clock its sweet melody rang.

Soon the old clock may stand all alone,
Nor mark off the moments of time;
The sound of its ticking be gone,
And silent the silvery chime.

3.
Oh what joys and what moments of pain,
Before thee, old clock there have been,
The dead in thy presence have lain,
While sorrow wept over the scene.

But life's moments they soon pass away,
Friends part that may never meet more;
But tho' earth and its pleasures decay,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
