1. Sail! home, as straight as an arrow. 
My yacht shoots along on the crest of the sea; 
Sail! home, to sweet Maggie Darrow, 
In her dear little home she is waiting for me. 
High up! where cliffs they are craggy, 
There’s where the girl of my heart waits for me! 
Heigh! ho, I long for you, Maggie, 
I’ll spread out my “White Wings” and sail home to thee. 
Yo! ho, how we go! Oh, how the winds blow!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
“White Wings,” they never grow weary, 
They carry me cheerily over the sea; 
Night! comes, I long for my dearie, 
I’ll spread out my “white wings” and sail home to thee!

2. Sail! home, to love and caresses, 
When Maggie, my darling, is there at my side; 
Sail! home, blue eyes and gold tresses,— 
The fairest of all is my own little bride. 
Sail! home, to part from thee never, 
Always together life’s voyage shall be; 
Sail! home,  to  love thee forever! 
I’ll spread out my “White Wings” and sail home to thee. 
Yo! ho, how we go! Oh, how the winds blow!
