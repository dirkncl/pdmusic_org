1. Come to me darling,
Come once again,
Bring but thy sweet smile,
’twill banish my pain,
Joy seens the brighter with thee by my side;
Come to me darling,
Be my joy and pride.
Come to my darling,
Come to me now,
Lovingly rest your hand on my brow;
Banish forever pain from this heart,
From me, oh! never, never depart!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Come to me darling,
Come once again,
Bring but thy sweet smile ’twill banish my pain,
Joys seem the brighter with thee by my side,
Come to me darling,
By my joy and pride.

2. Come to me darling,
Come once again,
Spring flow’rs aree fading,
and pining for rain,
So my and spirit is waiting for thee;
Come with thy sunshine,
Happy let me be.
Dreary and lonely,
Seems the long dar,
Nought but thy sweet smile can cheer my lone way;
Come with thy soft voice loving and kind,
Then shall my fond heart happiness find.
