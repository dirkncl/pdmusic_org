Crimson roses gem the heather, 
Blushing in the clasp of June. 
Woods, and vales and gleaming waters; 
Echo back the songsters tune. 
We, too, smile away all sadness, 
Bathing in the sunshine free, 
Blest indeed that summer’s promise 
Writes itself in melody. 
Blest indeed that sumer’s mer’s promise 
Writes itself in melody. 
But, when joys and hopes have vanished, 
Still is left a pureer love, 
Smile anew! and swept with triumph,  
Flowers on earth, and God above. 
Crimson roses, love’s sweet emblem, 
Hea ven’s interpreters may be, 
Blessed, blessed truths, 
Divinely written, 
Written dear, for you and me, 
Written, dear for you and me. and 
Bloom and beauty, song and sunshine, 
Wake no gladness in my heart, 
Careless when the summer cometh, 
Careless still though it depart. 
Love and joy, and hope have faded, 
Faded ded from my life away, 
Roses white, and roses crimson 
Have no charm for me today;
