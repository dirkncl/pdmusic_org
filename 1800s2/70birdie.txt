1. Birdie flew up in a blossoming tree;
Sad was my heart as I wander’d along.
Birdie was as cheerful could be,
Breathing its life out in beautiful song.

“Summer and winter contented I live,
Hark to the lesson a birdie can give.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Cares that fall today,
Time can ne’er repent;
Clouds will fade away,
Life, O life is sweet!
Cares that fall today
Time can ne’er repeat;
Clouds will fade away,
Life, O life is sweet!
Ah! Ah!
Ah! sweet!
Ah! sweet!

2. O but the skies were delightful and blue!
Gone were the doubts and the grief and the pain.
Bright were the roses all dimpled with dew;
Birdie sang over the lesson again.

Then in my heart sang a birdie to me,
Answering the birdie high up in the tree.
