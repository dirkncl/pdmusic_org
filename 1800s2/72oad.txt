1.
Life was all sweetness
When you were by!
Bright Hope's completeness
Woke, soon to die!
Fond words were spoken,
Love deemed them true!
Vows yet unbroken
My heart then knew!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Gone, like a vision,
Love's honeyed gleam!--
'Mid hopes elysian
We did but dream!
'Twas but a vision--
Only a dream.

2.
Sweet eyes of brightness
Look not in mine!
Hours winged with lightness,
No more will shine!
Cold, now, our greeting;
Can love forget?
How strange our meeting!--
How once we met!
