Early in the morning, before the break of day,
You hear sweet distant chimes,
Far, far away,
Down in the meadow lea,
High in the poplar tree,
You hear the Shanghai crowing,
Cock a doo doo diddle doo.
And a tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tuck, tuck.
And a tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck.
tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tuckuck.
Hear the Shanghai crow,
Early in the morning,
when the ground is full of snow.
