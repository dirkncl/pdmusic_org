1.
We from childhood play'd together,
My dear comrads Jack and I.
We would fight each other's battles,
To each other's aid we'd fly;--
And in boyish scrapes and troubles,
You would find us ev'ry where,
Where one went the other followed,
Naught could part us for we were,

CHORUS [sung after 1st and 2nd verses]
We were comrades, comrades ever since we were boys,
Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joys,
Comrades when manhood was dawning,
Faithful whatev'er might betide,
When danger threatened my darling old comrade
was there by my side.

2.
When just budding into manhood,
I yearn'd for a Soldier's life,
Night and day I dream'd of glory,
Longing for the battle's strife;
I said, "Jack I'll be a Soldier,
'Neath the Red the White and Blue,
Goodbye Jack!" said he, "no, never!
If you go, then I'll go too."

3.
I enlisted, Jack came with me,
And ups and downs we shared,
For a time our lives were peaceful,
But at length war was declared;
England's flad had been insulted,
We were ordered to the front,
And the Reg'ment we belong'd to
Had to bear the battle's brunt.
