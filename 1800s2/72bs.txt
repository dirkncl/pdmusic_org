1.
From the desert I come to thee 
On a stallion shod with fire, 
And the winds are left behind 
In the speed of my desire. 
Under thy window I stand 
And the midnight hears my cry, 
I love thee, I love but thee, 
With a love that shall not die 
Till the sun grows cold, 
And the stars are old, 
And the leaves of the judgement Book unfold. 

2.
Look from thy window and see 
My passion and my pain. 
I lie on the sands below 
And I faint in thy disdain, 
Let the night winds touch thy brow 
With the heat of my burning sigh 
And melt thee to hear the vow 
Of a love that shall not die 
Of a love that shall not die 
Till the sun grows cold, 
And the stars grow old, 
And the leaves of the judgement Book unfold. 

3.
My steps are nightly driven 
By the fever in my breast 
To hear from thy lattice breathed 
The word that shall give me rest. 
Open the door of thy heart 
And open thy chamber door 
And my kisses shall teach thy lips 
The love that shall fade no more 
Till the sun grows cold, 
And the stars are old, 
nd the leaves of the judgement Book unfold.
