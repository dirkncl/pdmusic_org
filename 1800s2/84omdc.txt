"Oh My Darling Clementine" (13 Oct. 1884)
Song and Chorus
Words by H S. Thompson, 1863
(from "Down By the River Lived a Maiden", 28 Dec. 1863)
Music by Percy Montrose

1.
In a cabin,
In a can[y]on, an excavation for a mine;
Dwelt a miner,
A Forty-niner,
And his daughter Clementine.

CHORUS
Oh my darling, (Clementine,)
Oh my darling, (Clementine,)
Oh my darling, (Clemen-Clementine,)
Clementine, (Clemen-Clementine,)
You are lost and (Clementine,)
gone forever (Clementine,)
Defful sorry, (Clementine,) Clementine.

2.
She drove her ducklets,
To the river,
Ev'ry morning just at nine;
She stubb'd her toe, against a sliver,
And fell into the foaming brine.

(CHORUS)

3.
I saw her lips above the water,
Blowing bubbles soft and fine;
Alas for me, I was no swimmer,
And so I lost my Clementine.

(CHORUS)
