1.
One evenin' in de month of May,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
I met old Peter on de way,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Moses wept and Abram cried,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Satan's coming don't you hide,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun.

REFRAIN
Johnny get your gun, get your gun today,
Pigeons a flying all the way,
If you want to get to Heaven in de good ole way,
Johnny get your gun, get your gun!

CHORUS
Rolling on,
Rolling on to glory children
Rolling on,
Johnny get your gun, get your gun!

2.
Oh, now good children do yo' best,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
And button on your golden vest,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Tell your Uncles and your Aunts,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Fetch along their linen pants,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
The way am rough wid briar roots,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
We'll shoot old Satan 'fore he scoots,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
When you hear de rascal yell,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Aim your musket, give him--well,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

4.
I looked old Satan in the eye,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Said he, "I'll want you by an' by,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Fetch me up an Alderman,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun,
Put him in my frying pan,
  Johnny get your gun, get your gun.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
