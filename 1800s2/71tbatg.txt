1. 
By the flow of the inland river, 
Whence the fleets of i  ron have fled, 
Where the blades of the gravegrass quiver, 
Asleep are the ranks of the dead; 
Under the sod and the dew, 
Waiting the judgement day; 
Under the one, the Blue; 
Under the other the Gray; 
Under the one the Blue; 
Under the other the Gray. 
These in the robings of glory, 
Those in the gloom of dedeat. 
All with the battle blood gory, 
In the dusk of eternity meet; 
Under the sod and the dew, 
Waiting the judgement day; 
Under the laurel the Blue. 
Under the willow the Gray. 
Under the laurel the Blue, 
Under the willow the Gray.

2. 
From the silence of sorrowful hours, 
The desolate mourners go, 
Lovingly la den with flowers, 
Alike for the friend and the foe; 
Under the sod and the dew, 
Waiting the judge0ment day; 
Under the roses, the Blue; 
Under the lilies the Gray; 
Under the roses the Blue; 
Under the lilies the Gray. 
So with an equal splendor 
The morning sunrays fay, 
With a  touch impartialty tender, 
On the blossoms blooming for all; 
Under the sod and the dew. 
Waiting the judgement day; 
Broidered with gold the Blue. 
Mellowed with gold the Gray. 
Broidered with gold, the Blue, 
Mellowed with gold the Gray.

3. Sadly, but not with upbraiding,
The generous deed was done;
In the storm of the years that are fading,
No braver battle was won;­­
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgement day;­­
Under the blossoms, the Blue,
Under the garlands, the Gray.
Under the blossoms, the Blue,
Under the garlands, the Gray.
No more shall the warcry sever
Or the winding rivers be red;
They banish our anger forever
When they laurel the graves of our dead
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgement day;­­
Love and tears for the Blue,
Tears and love for the Gray.
Love and tears for the Blue,
Tears and love for the Gray.
