1. If you want to see dis darkey smile, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon! 
I always said from a little chile, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon, 
An ole blind mule kicked uncle Ned, 
He kicked so hard dat he killed him dead, 
And de only word we heard him said, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Yes, dat juicy watermelon, 
’Tis de sweetest fruit dat grows, 
I love it, I’ll have it, 
No matter where I goes, 
Yes, dat juicy watermelon, 
’Tis de sweetest fruit dat grows, 
I love it, I’ll have it, 
No matter wher I goes!

2. I’ll drink all de juice and eat up de rine, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon! 
It makes me feel so good and fine, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon, 
Doctor Tanner fasted forte days, 
Dey tempted him in many ways, 
At last he said and said it loud, 
Gim me dat sweet watermelon!
