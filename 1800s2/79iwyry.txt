1.
I wore your roses yesterday: 
About this light robe’s folds of white, 
Wherein their gathered sweetness lay,.
Still clings their  perfume, perfume of delight.
And all in vain the warm wind sweeps 
Thosealry folds like vapor fine, 
Among them still the oder sleeps, 
And haunts me with a dream divine, a dream divine.

2. So be my heart yourmem’ry clings, 
So sweet, as rich, so delicate;
Eternal summertime it brings, 
Defying all the storms of fate, 
Defying all the storms of fate;
A power to turn the darkness bright, 
A power to turn the darkness bright 
Till life with matchless beauty glows;
Each moment touched with tender light, 
And ev’ry thought of you a rose!
And ev’ry thought of you, ev’ry thought of you a rose!
