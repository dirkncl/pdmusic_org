1. Yes, it swingeth on its hinges
As it did in days of yore,
And the very same old creaking you will hear,
And the rattle of the latch,
As it drops upon the catch,
Yet is sweetest music to my longing ear.
The dear ones that have gone,
O’er its threshold thin and worn,
Have pass’d for ever one by one away;
And the children that once play’d
Hide and seek within its shade,
Now are old and wrinkled, weary worn and grey.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
But the click of the latch,
As it falls upon the catch,
Sounds the same year after year;
And the rattle and the squeak,
Is the same week after week,
Of that old kitchen door so dear.

2. At midnight when ’tis still
And the wind rests on the hill—
Feet patter on the bare old kitchen floor;
And the tinkle of the latch,
As it falls upon the catch,
And the gentle closing of the open door,
Tells to me in words so dear,
That the lost ones onces so dear,
Love to leave the golden starty plain,
Just to walk upon the floor,
And ope and shut the door,
That swings in that old kitchen once again.

3. Yes I want the door to swing
On its worn and rusty hinge,
As long as I can go my daily round;
And let its click so dear,
Be the last thing that my ear
Catches till it hears the heav’nly trumpet sound,
Oh, will I wander back,
O’er that dark and unknown track,
Will I leave the golden sanded shore.
Just to raise and drop the latch
On that old and rusty catch,
And walk again that bare old kitchen floor.
