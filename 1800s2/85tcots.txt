1. Winter has come, with frolic and glee, 
And social enjoyments abound. 
Old Christmas-tide fellows, oh hear now his voice, 
As he scatters his bounties around.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
The compliments of the season, 
The compliments of the season 
With a happy New Year, 
To all we hold dear! 
And the compliments of the season. 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
The compliments of the season, 
The compliments of the season, 
With a  Happy New Year, to all we hold dear,  
And the compliments of the season. 
With a happy New Year, 
To all we hold dear! 
And the compliments of the season. 

2. New Year steps in, with gift laden hands; 
Let’s greet him with joy and with mirth 
And let us reecho and out all the world, 
This greeting to you at his birth

3. Let us then cherish this season of joy 
And scatter all sorrows away 
And give to the lonely and sad hearted ones 
A word of kind greetting and say

4. We now, kind friends  must bid you farewell, 
May blessings your pathways attend 
May ev’ry New Year bring to those we held dear 
All happiness, joy withour end.
