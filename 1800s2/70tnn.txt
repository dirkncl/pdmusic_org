1.
In Ole Kentuck dere lib’d a nig,
A nig, nig, nig, a niggardly nig.
He nebber got fat, he nebber got big,
He was such a niggardly nigger;
De darkies said it was a fack
Dat dis yer black, dis Miser Jack,
Hadn’t a boot or a shoe to his back,.
He was such a niggardly nigger.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
He was such a niggardly nig, nig
He neber got fat, he nebber got big,
He nebber geb nuflin to nobody, cos
He was such a niggardly nigger, he was.

2.
He’d gold and silver and heaps of tin,
But all his flesh was bone and skin,
For eating and drinking he said was a sin,
He was such a niggardly nigger;
A smell of a bone would a breakfast be,
A smell and a half for dinner had he,
And what was left he had for his tea,
He was such a niggardly nigger.

3.
He sold de wool dat made his bed,
He sold de wool from off his head,
He’d sell himself de darkies said,
He was such a naggardly nigger,
He sold de clothes from off his back,
Except his under suit ob black,
He nebber would laugh, dat suit to crack,
He was such a niggardly nigger.

4.
Ole Jack grinned wid great delight,
When a big muskeeter gib him a bite,
He lib’d on dat day and a night,
He was such a nigardly nigger.
He caught de measles but den said he,
Dis pleasure it all belongs to me,
So I wont gib dem to nobody,
He was such a niggardly nigger.

5.
Dey thought dat he was near his deff,
So den dey sent for Fader Jeff,
But Jacky wouldn’t gib up his breff,
He was such a niggardly nigger.
At last his eyes dey got so dim,
He said dat dey might have dere whim,
If dey would bury de gold wid him,
He was such a niggardly nigger.

6.
Old Jack was put beneath de mould,
Till one young nigger he got so bold,
He said he’d go and get de gold,
De gold of de nigardly nigger.
But when he got dere he shibbered wid fright,
For dere he saw in black and white,
Watching de gold wid all his might,
De ghost ob de niggardly nigger.
