1. De bumble bee is hummin’, 
De sunny days am commin’, 
De possum he am bummin’ 
Away up in de tree; 
O, Ise de gallas rover, 
Wid fun I’m bilin' over, 
Dis nigger he’s in clober— 
Dats good enough for me! 
O, go ’way from me honey, 
I’m lively as de flea, 
And full of fun, my work am done— 
Dats good enough for me! 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Den go ’way honey, dont you see,— 
You take de breff away from me!

2. O, I’m in lub wid Liza, 
De gayest tantaliza, 
De nicest ob de nicer, 
In style you must agree; 
While odders lub de roses, 
And some de Roman noses 
All in her Sunday clo’ses— 
She’s good enough for me! 
She sets my heart a singing, 
Like Junebugs in de tree, 
I tell you all, both short and tall— 
She’s good enough for me! 

3. Ise light as any fedder, 
Dars whiskey in the medder, 
O, if I only had her, 
How happy I would be; 
I feel as gay and funny, 
Her kiss is sweet as honey, 
O, she’s de gal “for money,”— 
And good enough for me! 
Among the stars asalin’, 
Dis couple you will see, 
And when we go, I tole you so— 
She’s good enough for me!
