1. 
[Baritone Solo]
Beneath the cool Autumnal skies, 
The ripened corn and fruits appear; 
Let anthems to the Giver rise 
For all the blessings of the year. 
[Soprano Solo]
’Twas He who cover’d o’er the mead 
With pastures green and fragrant flow’rs; 
[Trio (SAT)]
The sun, the rain, the quicken’d seed 
Have cloth’d the fields and tent the bow’rs. 

CHORUS (SATB) 1
How blest the land, where home and fame 
With Truth’s sublimest strains resound! 
Rich are the sunripe fruits and grain, 
But richer gifts from Heav’n abound

2. 
[Baritone Solo]
The streams reflect each flowery spray 
That bends above them as they glide 
When spring in blossom’d boughs is gay, 
Or summer glows with warmer pride. 
[Soprano Solo]
The flocks are glad on hillsides green 
The birds are tuneful in the wood; 
[Trio (SAT)]
Joy smiles in every sylvan scene, 
As Plenty fills the land with food.

CHORUS (SATB) 2
Rich are the gifts from Nature’s hand, 
Yet richer good to all is given; 
Let loud thanksgiving thrill the land, 
So much belov’d and blessed of Heav’n!
