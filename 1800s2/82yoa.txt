1. List to the strains that I murmured so lovely,
Yet once again by thy side let me be.
Here quite alone let me tell
To thee only the love that for years
I have cherished for thee.
Let me kneel at your feet
While I fervently tell
The feeling contained in this pooor aching heart.
Do not forsake me
But tenderly dwell
On those dear loving words
We meet not to part.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Yet once again let me see
  Once again let me see
those bright eyes.
  those bright eyes.
Beaming with love
  Beaming with love,
light and only for me.
  yes only for me.
Whisper my future in tones of affection,
Fairest of loved ones,
My life ’tis for thee, for thee.
Yes life is for thee, yes life is for thee.
  yes for thee. Beaming with love,
yes only for me.

2. Ah do not spurn me but let me remain
Pleading not vainly for one simple boon.
Let me but hear your sweet voice once again
Saving that your answer is coming and soon.
Oh, the beam of your dear laughing eye bids me cling
That love’s fondest hope to my heart I may press.
Here while the birds
O’erhead sweetly sing
Give me your answer
And let it be yes.
