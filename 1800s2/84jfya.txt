1. I’m dreaming of the happy days, 
That  you and I have known;
Your hair was bright and golden then, 
It now has silver grown.
Ah! nestle to my heart, sweet wife!
Thro’ years of storm and shine 
We’ve journeyed on together here, 
Since first your love was mine.
I see the school where first we met, 
In childhood’d rosy glow.
And all the playmates that we knew 
Just fifty years ago!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Just fifty years ago! (Fifty years!)
Just fifty years ago! (Fifty years!)
You’ve dearer grown to me each day, (Each day,)
Since Just fifty years ago!

2. The daisied meadows where we played 
Are now a busy town;
And strange are all the faces there 
That wander up and down.
The mill beside the silver stream 
Has long since passed away;
And where our little cottage stood, 
A mansion stands today.
Oh! where are gone the many friends, 
That once we used to know?
How many in the churchyard sleep 
Since fifty years ago!

3. No matter where our eyes may turn 
The world,— how changed it seems 
Since you and I were sweethearts, dear.
Or lived our childhood’s dreams.
Your eyes have known what sorrow is;
We’ve laid our own to rest!

Oh! loving ones are waiting us 
In yonder home so blest!
May we be called together, dear, 
Nor parted here be low;
For side by side we’ve journeyed on 
Since fifty years ago!
