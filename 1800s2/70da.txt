1. Homeless and sad I have wandered along, 
No one  to help me in all the gay throng;
Hopeless  and heartsick, in tears and despair, 
Bowed with misfortune and sorrow and  care.
Once I was young, once I was glad,— 
Flattered and prais’d by the friends that I had!
Night’s coming on, pity has flown, 
Here in the streets I am dying alone!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Helpless and weary, no roof but the sky!
Breathing  a prayer to my Father on high;
Pity, Oh, pity me, list to my moan— 
Out in the streets I am dying alone!

2. Round me  the shadows are  gathering fast, 
Refuge and safety are near me at last!
O, could my mother but kneel by me now!
Give me her blessing, and smooth my worn brow.
Clad in these rags, wtretch ed and wild, 
Never on earth would she know her lost child;
Cold is the night, darker ’tis grown, 
Here in the streets I am dying alone!

3. Faint, now, and dim grow the lamps of the street, 
Hush’d all the footsteps that wearily beat;
Life now  is ebbing, its pain and its fears, 
Gone are my sorrows, my hunger and tears!
Friendless and poor, helpless by night, 
Soon shall I see yonder mansions of light!
Heav’n has one Friend will not disown, 
Thee in the streets I am dying alone!
