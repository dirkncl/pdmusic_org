1. 
Mother dear come bathe my forehead, 
For I知 growing very weak, 
Mother let one drop of water 
Fall upon my burning cheek. 
Tell my loving little schoolmates, 
That I never more will play, 
Give them all my toys, but Mother, 
Put my little shoes away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I am going to leave you Mother, 
So remember what I say, 
Oh! do it, won稚 you, please, dear Moth er, 
Put my little shoes away.

2. 
Santa Claus he gave them to me, 
With a lot of other things; 
And I think he brought an angel, 
With a pair of golden wings. 
Mother I will be an angel, 
By perhaps another day; 
So you will then dearest Mother, 
Put my little shoes away.

3. 
Soon the baby will be larger, 
Then they値l fit his little feet; 
Oh! he値l look so nice and cunning, 
When he walks along the street. 
Now I知 getting tired Mother, 
Soon I値l say to all good day; 
Please remember what I told you, 
Put my little shoes away.
