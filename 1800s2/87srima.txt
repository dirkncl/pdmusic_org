1. Gently, slowly to and fro, 
Sways the old arm chair. 
Tenderly the evening breese 
Stirs the curls of golden hair 
Drowsy eyelids softly closing, 
Lullaby has worked its charm, 
Slumber deep has come to baby, 
Safely rocked in mother’s arms.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Lullaby, sweet lullaby, 
Silver stars begin to peep, 
Lullaby, Sweet lullaby, 
Hush all sound while baby sleeps. 
Now baby’s sorrows all have vanished, 
Sooth’d by lullaby’s sweet charms, 
Gently, slowly to and fro, 
Lullaby, sweet lullaby, 
Safely rocked in mother’s arms.

2. Snowwhite brow and rosy cheeks, 
Parted lips two teeth disclose: 
All that mother loves on earth 
Safe within her arms repose 
Oh! the pray’rs to Heaven whispered, 
Pow’r to shield him from all harm, 
May be find in years of sorrow, 
Sweetest rest in mother’s arms.
