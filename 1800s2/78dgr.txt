1.
I'm a going to cross de river on de gospel raft, 
like Noah in de good ole ark,
Keep your candles all a burning, keep 'em burning all de time,
or you'll lose yourself and stumble in the dark,
Get your baggage on de craft, don't for get to get the check,
for you've got to pay your passage right to day.
Be sure de money's good, for de captains eyes is sharp,
you can't sneak aboard and hide away.

CHORUS
Hide away, (Hide away,) hide away, (hide away,)
dar's no use in try'ng to hide away.
Get your baggage on de craft, don't for get to get the check,
you can't sneak aboard and hide away.

2.
Now take warning, little children, don't get fooled about de raft,
for de opposition boats are running too,
But she's liable to bust the boiler any time at all,
and cook you niggers all into stew,
I'se got a private box, and an opra glass to see
you sinners trying to buzz in at de door.
But they'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de grace,
if you come back they'll slap you on de jaw.

(CHORUS)

3.
Let me tell you 'bout de army mister Pharo' did command,
when he followed ole Moses long ago,
They was drownded in de water with their life preservers on,
and de fishes had a jublee down below,
Dar was Jonah was a fool and as stubborn as a mule,
but de whate did make him quickly disappear.
Jonah den pulled out a razor and he cut de whale in half,
and floated to shore upon his ear.

(CHORUS)
