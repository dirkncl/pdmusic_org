1. When day is done, 
And night comes on, 
And stars shine forth o’er land and sea, 
There comes an hour, 
The only hour, 
More than all others, dear to me! 
The hour I wait thy coming, love; 
The hour I wait thy coming, love! 
For then my darling’s face I see! 
More dear than all the world to me, 
For then my darling’s face I see, 
More dear than all to me!

2. When night is o’er, 
And the bright sun, 
Sheds its soft beams, dear one on thee, 
If by its light, 
It leads me, love, 
To hear thy voice so sweet to me! 
That is the hour the only hour, 
That is the hour, the only hour, 
For then my darling’s face I see! 
More dear than all the world to me, 
For then my darling’s face I see, 
More dear than all to me!

3. No other face, 
In all the world, 
Can with this lovely one compars; 
My eyes I strain, 
And look in vain, 
For one that is to me so fair! 
I see it now, it looks at me. 
I see it now, it looks at me, 
It is my darling’s face I see! 
More dear than all the world to me, 
It is my darling’s face I see, 
More dear than all to me!
