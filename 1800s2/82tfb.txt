1. My love he is a farmer’s lad 
As loving as can be 
There’s not a  boy as sweet on earth! 
Not one  to dear to me, 
And while the stars are shin ing bright, 
Much pleasure I  enjoy. 
While rambling in the summer night, 
While rambling in the summer night, 
With Bill the farmers boy! 
There’s none so sweet, none so neat, none  so light and gay, 
None so light! and gay ever singing night and day, 
Some sweet and cheerful, sweet and cheerful lay. 
And when I hear his welcome step. 
It fills my heart with joy. 
I always lave a lovers kiss, 
For Bill the farmer’s boy. 
For Bill the farmer’s boy, 
For Bill the farmer’s boy. 
I always have a loving kiss, 
For Bill! the farmer’s boy 
I’ve a loving kiss, for Bill! the farmer’s boy.

2. I saunter thro’ the quiet fields 
When e’er my heart is sad 
And ’neath some shady tree I sit, 
Beside this cheerful lad, 
For when he’s near 
No grief have I, 
Nor troubles to annoy. 
For happy words I always hear, 
For happy words I always hear, 
From Bill the farmers boy! 
He’s ever gay, both night and day; 
His heart is never sad; Never sad! 
He meets me always with a smile, 
This merry, merry, merry, merry farmer’s boy. 
And walking by his side at night, 
My soul is filled with jpy. 
I hear the sweet and loving words, 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy. 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy, 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy. 
I hear the sweet and loving words, 
Of Bill! the farmer’s boy 
Hear the loving words, of Bill! the farmer’s boy.

3.ˆLast night under the chestnut tree 
My lover said to me 
Become my wife, my dainty lass, 
And happy days we’ll see 
I answer’d with a loving kiss, 
I could not speak for joy. 
He long I’ve waited for these words, 
So long I’ve waited for those words, 
From Bill the farmers boy! 
My loving lad he was so glad 
Beneath that chestnut tree, 
That chestnut tree! 
He spoke about the happy times, the happy times 
That we should surely, we should surely see. 
And as we homeward trudged our way, 
Our love’s transfixed by joy. 
That night in dreams I kissed the lips, 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy.; 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy, 
Of Bill the farmer’s boy. 
That night in dream I kissed the lips, 
Of Bill! the farmer’s boy 
Kiss’d the lips of Bill, the lips of Bill the farmer’s boy.
