1. When I am dead, above my head 
The breeze in gentle tones will sigh; 
The flow’rs will spring, the birds will sing, 
And speeding time go swiftly by. 
New days will break, new hopes awake, 
As flying hours each other chase; 
Oh, bitter thought with sadness fraught, 
Another one will take our place.

QUARTET [sung after each verse]
Tides ebb and flow, men come and go, 
New joys arise as old ones die, 
And hopes are born with ev’ry morn, 
While time is speeding quickly by; 
Tho’ hearts may ache, they do not break, 
Time’s healing hand all pains efface; 
Life moveth on, though we are gone, 
Another one will take our place.

2. Tides ebb and flow, men come and go, 
New joys arise as old ones die; 
And hopes are born with ev’ry morn, 
While time is speeding quickly by. 
Naught can avail, e’en love grows pale, 
And new hopes oler ones efface; 
We have our day, then pass away, 
Another one will take our place.

3. Those who are dear will gather near, 
And mourn when we are laid away; 
But tears will dry as grief will fly, 
For gloomy night leads on today. 
Though hearts may ache, they do not break, 
Time’s healing hand all pains efface; 
Life moveth on, though we are gone, 
Another one will take our place.
