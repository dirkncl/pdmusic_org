1. Down in the valley where the violets grew
There’s where I’d meet my love,
She’s such a beauty with a heart so true
Eyes like the stars above.
Strolling mid clover and jessamine,
Arm in arm we’d go,
There I would kiss this pretty queen,
And she would not say “No.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh my! how happy we would be
When I sweetly kissed her and she kissed me,
Down in the valley where the violets grew,
Down in the valley when no one knew,
There I would meet me love so true,
Down in the valley where the violets grew.

2. Down in the valley on Summer’s eve
She promised to be mine,
I told her that I never would deceive
Then our arms did entwine.
Soon I will make her my loving wife,
And to her now I go,
For she is waiting in the valley sweet,
Where the pretty violets grow.
