1. I’ve a letter that was written long ago,
’Tis a letter that I’ve treasured many years;
Oh! how often I have read those fading lines;
And over them there’s traces of my tears,
She sent to me her blessing in that missive,
To see me was her constant holy pray’r,
The little lock of gray in this old letter,
Is a lock of my angel mother’s hair.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I’ve a letter that was sent me long ago,
A letter that I keep with tender care,
The little lock of gray in this old letter,
Is a lock of my angel mother’s hair.

2. I’ve a ;letter that was written long ago,
That was sent to me across the stormy sea;
When ’mong strangers I was wand’ring far away;
And longing home again to ever be,
But underneath the sod my mother’s sleeping,
She’s free from earthly trials and its care,
But ever next my heart I’ll keep her letter,
And the lock of my angel mother’s hair.
