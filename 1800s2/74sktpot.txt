1. My tho’ts now are wand’ring far over the sea, 
They’re clinging to dear Erin’s lovely Isle, 
For there is one dearer than all else to me, 
I cherish her sweet voice and winning smile; 
I long for the hour when I’ll meet you, dear Katie, 
My darling one over the sparkling blue sea, 
What joy it would bring to my heart yes, to me, 
To meet my sweet Katie, the pride of Tralee. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
My thoughts now are wand’ring far over the sea, 
They’re clinging to dear Erin’s Isle, 
For this is one dearer than all else to me, 
My darling, my Katie, the pride of Tralee.

2. I know that your heart will be true to me still, 
Though I’m in a land, loved one, far away; 
When I cross the ocean to meet you again, 
You’ll welcome me back to my home that day; 
In that little cottage, beside you, sweet Katie, 
O, what would be dearer than that, love, to me! 
I’d brave all the dangers of both land and sea, 
For Katie, my darling, the pride of Tralee.

3. Dear land of the Shamrock, the land of my birth, 
I love her green pastures and valleys fair, 
The home of my kindred, the home of my youth, 
Whereever I roam, yet my heart is there; 
And then there’s a treasure, it is my own Katie; 
When dreaming all this, O what bliss then to me! 
My heart it is longing to cross the blue sea, 
To meet my sweet Katie, the pride of Tralee.
