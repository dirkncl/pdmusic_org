1.
Oh, come you sinners, go wid me,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
I'll take you down to Tennessee,
  Oh, I'll be dar,

Come and join de silver band,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
I'se gwine to fly to Canaan's land,
  Oh, I'll be dar.

CHORUS 2 times
I'll be dar.
I'll be dar.
When de muster roll am calling,
I'll be dar, sure's ye'r born.

2.
You jump right on that lilly white steed,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
I'se g'wine to heav'n, I is indeed,
  Oh, I'll be dar,

Down in de field a huskin' corn,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
I though I heard old Gabriel's horn,
  Oh, I'll be dar.

(CHORUS)

3.
Corn-stalk-fiddle, an' a shoe-string bow,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
Dance wid de nigs wid de big heel and toe,
  Oh, I'll be dar,

Old corn dodger, an' a sweet tater pie,
  Oh, I'll be dar,
Go 'way nigs, don't you come nigh,
  Oh, I'll be dar.

(CHORUS)
