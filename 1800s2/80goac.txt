1. My Granny, do you see, at the age of eighty three, 
One day was taken ill and soon she died; 
And after she was dead, 
The will to us was read, 
By a Lawyer as we stood side by side 
To my Brother then I found, 
She had left a Hundred pounds, 
And the same unto my sister I declare, 
But when he came to me, 
“Ah” the Lawyer says “I see, 
She’s but left to you her Old arm chair.”

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Hey they tittered! how they chaffed! 
How my brothers and my sisters laughed, 
When they heard the Law yer declare, 
Granny only left to me her old arm chair.

2. Now I thought it hardly fair, yet I said I did not care,
And in the evening took the chair away;
The Neighbors at me laughed,
And my Brother at me chaffed,
And he said “it will come handy John one day
When you’re settled down in life,
Take some young girl for your wife,
And then you will be happy I declare,
And when at home at night, 
and your fire is burning bright,
You can sit down in your Old arm chair.”

3. What my brother said came true, for in about a year or two
I soon was settled down in married life;
I first a girl did court,
And then the ring I bought,
Took her to church and soon she was my wife
Now the old girl and me,
We’re as happy as can be,
And when my work is over I declare,
“Abroad I never roam,
and at night I stay at home,
And sit down in my Old arm chair.”

4. Now one night the chair I found had fallen to the ground,
And the bottom had dropped out upon the floor;
And there to my surprise,
And right before my eyes,
Laid some banknotes of ten thousand pounds or more,
When my Brother heard of this,
Now the fellow I confess
And mad with rage he almost tore his hair,
When I said “now brother Jim
don’t you think it is a sin
That you didn’t get the Old arm chair.”
