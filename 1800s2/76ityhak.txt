Nineteenth-Century America"]

1. 
I’ll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide, 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride. 
The roses all have left you cheek, 
I've watched them fade awayand die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears dedim your loving eyes.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen,
Take you back, Kathleen,
To where your heart will feel no pain,
Heart will feel no pain,
And when the fields are fresh and green,
Fields are fresh and green,
I'll take Take you to your home again. gain, home again.

2. 
I know you love me, Kathleen, dear,
Your heart was ever fond and true;
I always feel when you are near,
That life holds nothing dear but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me,
I scarcely ever see them now,
Tho' many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

3. 
To that dear home beyond the sea,
My Kathleen shall again return,
And when thy old friends welcome thee,
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream,
Beside your mother's humble cot,
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam,
There all your grief will be forgot.
