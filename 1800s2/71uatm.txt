1. Where the heather blossoms
  In the summer prime
Where the snowdrift glistens
  In the winter time
Where the shepher gathers
  His flock from storms to hide
Up among the mountains
  I would ever bide.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Up among the mountains
  I would ever bide.

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Up among the mountains
  Up among the mountains
Up among the mountains
  I would ever bide.

2. Where the streamlet wanders
  The forest pines among
Vocal in the spring tide
  With the lavrock’s song
Where the lark first rising
  Pour music high and wide
Up amon the mountains
  I would ever bide.

3. But to share these beauties
  Through the changing year
My sweet Cambrian lassie
  Must be ever near
And with such a partner
  What might e’er be tide
Up among the mountains
  I would ever bide.
