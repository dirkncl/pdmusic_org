1. No Grandpa’s pet with golden hair, 
And dimpled chin and forehead fair, 
Or pleassures true has greater share, 
Then I my Grandma’s darling; 
A little boy as full of fun, 
As anyboy beneath the sun; 
The day with joy is overrun, 
For I am Grandma’s darling.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
My Grandma has the whitest hair, 
Her cheeks are soft, and oh so fair; 
Her eyes are bright and deeply blue, 
And all her words are kind and true; 
O! happy, happy I, 
To be my Grandma’s darling.

2. I find her spec’s and hold her yarn,
And needles thread for her to darn,
And hunt for eggs thro’ all the barn,
For I am Grandma’s darling;
I bring her chips and pile her wood,
And try my best to be as good,
As any boy by trying could,
For I am Grandma’s darling.

3. Her stories, oh! they’re ree’lly grand,
I love to hear and hold her hand,
Then drift away to dreamer’s land,
So glad I’m Grandma’s darling;
Her eyes do shine, she loves me so,
With love as pure as falling snow;
There is no King so blest I know,
As I— my Grandma’s darling.
