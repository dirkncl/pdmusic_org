1. Shepherds watched their flocks by night, 
When they saw a heavenly light, 
When they saw a heavenly light, 
  And heard a joyful song. 

2. Fear ye not to you we bring, 
Tidings of a new born King, 
Tidings of a newborn King, 
  Who in a manger lies. 

3. Shepherds to the manger came
Saw the babe and praised His Name
Saw the babe and praised His Name
  And shouted loud for joy.

4. Joyful sang the angels then
Peace on earth, goodwill to men
Peace on earth, goodwill to men
  And praise to God on high.

5. Wise men travelling from afar
Saw on high the natal star
Saw on high the natal star
  And to the manger came.

6. Presents then they did unfold
Myrrh and frankincense and gold
Myrrh and frankincense and gold
  Which at His feet they laid.

7. Low before the infant Lord
Knelt the wise men and adored—
Knelt the wise men and adored—
  Worshipping the King.

8. Herod sought the child to slay
Then God sent His Son away
Then God sent His Son away
  To live in Egypt’s land.

9. To the cross at last He came
For our sins He bore its shame
For our sins He bore its shame
  But now He reigns above.

10. And the childrens’ friend is He
“Suffer them to come to me,”
Suffer them to come to me,”
  So we love Him well!

11. Let us then the carol sing
Glory to the infant King
Glory to the infant King
  When Chistmas time comes round.

Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Praise Him Hallelujah! Hail! Messiah, Prince of Peace.
