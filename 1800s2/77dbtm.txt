1. At night when the shadows are falling,
On the meadow the vale and the stream,
And the nightingale softly is calling,
And nature’s preparing to dream,
Then darling remember your promise,
I’ll wait for you down by the mill,
I’ll watch for your coming, so beaten,
When the moon rises over the hill.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
To night when the shadows are falling,
I’ll wait for you down by the mill,
I’ll watch for your coming so hasten,
When the moon rises over the hill.

2. To night when the whippoorwill’s calling,
I have something to whisper to you,
’Tis a secret I long to impart love,
I promise each word shall be true,
I’ll kiss you to keep it a secret,
And darling I’m sure that you will,
It only concerns you and I love,
So hasten love down to the mill.
