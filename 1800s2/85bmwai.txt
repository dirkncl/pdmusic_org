1. In the little brown cot, at the foot of the hill,
Dwells Bessie, my wife, and I,
And two happier creatures there never was seen,
Than Bessie, my wife, and I,
When homeward I turn, at the close of the day,
From labor and cares of this life,
I find Bessie waiting for me at the gate,
Sweet Bessie, my dear little wife.

2. O, when we two sit down to our evening repast,
Dear Bessie, my wife, and I,
If you could be see us, how cosey we are,
Dear Bessie, my wife and I,
The spread, spotless white, set with oldfashioned crock,
That grandmother used all her life;
The stove, silver bright, it is polish’d so nice
By Bessie, my own little wife.

3. We will give you the secret, if you’d like to know,
Fair Bessie, my wife, and I,
How we get such a beautiful gloss on our stove,
Fair Bessie, my wife and I,
Use “Dighton Rock Polish,” ’tis A, Number One,
You never will find it a loss;
For Bessie she says that her stove takes the cake,
For its beautiful silvery gloss.
