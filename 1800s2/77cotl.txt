1. Come o’er the lake with me love,
The moon is shining bright.
Upon yon mimic sea love,
We’ll float in her silver light,
The balmy summer breeze love,
Scarce moves the passive tide,
As it plays among the trees love,
That line the waters side.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Come o’er the lake with me my my my love,
The moon shines clear and bright,
Upon yon mimic sea sweet love,
We’ll float[, yes float] in her silver [light, her siler] light.

2. Sweet scents from newmown hay love,
Ascend from mead and vale.
And from the forest gray love,
Trills forth the nightingale,
They’ve left their gorgeous caves love,
Those Naiads fair to play,
On the lightly rippling waves love,
Where moonbeams sparkle gay.

3. All beauteous things combine love,
Around this cherished spot.
Be gladness thine and mine love,
All anxous cares forgot,
Afar in heav’ns blue dome love,
Those glim’ring stars we see,
Will guard secure thy home love,
Then haste away with me.
