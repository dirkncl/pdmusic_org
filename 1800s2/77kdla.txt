1. A-who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
Why don’t you keep dose lamps aburnin’,
Who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
Why don’t you let de bridegroom in!
A-lay low, a-lay low,
De seven foolish virgins comin’,
Lay low, a-lay low,
And never tell a whar you’ve been.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Keep dose lamps aburnin’;
Oh, keep dose lamps a-burnin’;
Oh, keep a dose lamps a-burnin’;
For de day will surely come, by’n’ bye!
Keep dose lamps a-burnin’;
Oh, keep dose lamps a-burnin’;
Oh, keep a dose lamps a-burnin’;
For de day will surely come.

2. A-who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
De ole man’s gone for to hunt dat rooster,
Who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
Keep a-dancin’ on de kitchen floor,
A-lay low, a-lay low,
My love is walkin’ in de garden,
Lay low, a-lay low,
She’ll never come again no more.

3. A-who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
De bowlegg’d duck wid his Uncle’s shoes on,
Who’s dar? a-who’s dar?
Somebody keep aholdin’ me,
A-lay low, a-lay low,
De ole hen tried for to hatch a pumpkin,
Lay low, a-lay low,
I’ll meet you at de Jubilee.
