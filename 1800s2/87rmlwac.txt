1. How well do I remember the lessons that I learn’d 
In childhood from my mother fond and true 
In accents full of joy she’d say my darling boy 
Now don’t forget what I am tell ing you 
As through this life you go you’ll meet with many a foe 
Temptations too will oft be set your way 
But when you kneel at night ask God to guide you right 
In all your actions each succeeding day

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then do not forget the lessons that you learn’d 
In childhood at your loving mother’s knee 
In thoughts of love so true she’ll still remember you 
Tho’ far from home and mother you may be.

2. Those lessons that I learn’d I think of with sweet pride 
And cherish those fond mem’ries dear to me 
Companions they have been in childhood oft I ween 
Since when I left my darling mother’s knee 
As older now I grow and think of years gone by 
One though of mother helps me on my way 
God bless her dear old face none other can replace 
Affections you receive in childhood’s day
