1. It was the old sweet stoty, 
Sweet story of old;
She was a village maiden, 
He was a warrior bold, 
He was a warrior bold.
"Farewell true heart we twain must part, 
The battle races fierce and free;
On a strange far shore, 
In the war’s wild roar, 
Think of me, maiden, and pray for me, 
Think of me, maiden, and pray for me” 

2. It was the old sad story, 
Sad story of old: 
Sore with the foeman’s arrow, 
Pierc’d lay the warrior bold, 
Though deep my wound the warrior moan’d 
"I have no dread, O Death, of thee, 
And my wound seems light, 
For I feel tonight 
That one true heart is praying for me, 
That one true heart is praying for me.” 

3. It was the old sweet story.
Sweet story of old: 
Heal’d of his wounds, in triumph 
Home turn’d the warrior bold, 
Home turn’d the warrior bold.
“O sweet true heart, no more we’ll part, 
O heart that yearn’d and pray’d for me, 
Thro’ thee I live, to thee I give 
This heart, this life, that was sav’d by thee, 
This heart, this life, that was sav’d by thee!”
