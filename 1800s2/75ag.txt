1.
Oh! my soul, my soul am a gwine for to rest,
In de arms of angel Gabriel,
And I climb on a hill and I look to de west,
And I cross over Jordan to de Lam';
And I'll sit me down in de old armchair,
Oh! brudders, I will never tire,
And old Satan my sneeze, but I will take my ease,
And I'll warm myself at de holy fire.

CHORUS
I will shout, (I will shout,)
And I'll dance, (And I'll dance,)
And I'll wake up early in de morn;
And I will arise, and rub my sleepy eyes,
When old Gabriel am blowing his horn.

2.
Oh1 my sould, my sould am a gwine for to rest,
Gwine to rest just as sure as I am born,
And I'll look like a blackbird a sitt'n' on a rest,
When old Gabr'll am blowing on de horn;
And I'll leave my clothes safe upon de shore,
For I'll have new garments for to wear;
And I'll have bran-new shoes, and never get de blues,
And de angels dey will come and curl my hair.

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh! ... I shan't weep  when I'm gwine for to leave,
So I'll pack up my band-box and I'll go,
And my brethren, oh! harken and don't ever grieve,
For I'm gwine up to glory very slow;
And I'll eat my meals, yes, three times a day,
Oh! you bet your life I won't be late,
And I'll have lots of fun, when you, my brethren, come,
For I'm gwine to take de tickets at de gate.

(CHORUS)
