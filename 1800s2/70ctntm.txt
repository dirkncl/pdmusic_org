1.
O Martha wept and Mary cried,
We’re all surrounded,
The good old man has gone and died;
We’re all surrounded,
Shake off your slimbers and arise,
We’re all surrounded,
The sun is shining in the skies,
We’re all surrounded.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then Carry the news,
Carry the news to Mary!
Carry the news,
We’re all surrounded.

2.
The good old man we’ll see no more,
We’re all surrounded,
He has gone to the happy shore;
We’re all surrounded,
He’s gone and left us darks alone,
We’re all surrounded,
And Gabriel’s trumpet call’d him home,
We’re all surrounded.

3.
Adam and Eve climb’d up a tree.
We’re all surrounded,
Their lamb and master for to see;
We’re all surrounded,
Eve stole an apple from the tree,
We’re all surrounded,
And Adam was stung by a bumble Bee,
We’re all surrounded.
