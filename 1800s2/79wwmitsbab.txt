1. Oh now I’se gwine to sing a song,
If you will listen I wont be long,
’Tis about dat bright and happy land,
Whar all good darkies will be found,
Den my brederen wont you meet us?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh yes we will meet you,
And wont we have a happy time,
When we meet in de sweet Bye and Bye;
Keep a shoutin den my bredderen wont you meet me?

2. Dem streets up dar am paved wid gold,
And dar we are not bought nor sold,
Dar we will meet and shout an’ sing,
An’ wont we make de welcome ring,
Den my brederen wont you meet us?

3. Now Gabriel he has bought his horn,
You’ll hear him blow it on dat morn,
An’ if you’re found on de left hand,
You will not see dat happy land,
Den my breddeen wont you meet us?
