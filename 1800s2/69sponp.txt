1.
Oh one and all attention give,
And a song I now will sing,
For I’ve hit upon a subject which I think’s the very thing.
You may talk about your handsome gals, your Betties, Kates, and Hanners,
But the sweetest gal I ever saw,
Oh! she play’d on nine pianos.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Pianos, pianos,
She play’d on nine pianos;
  One two three four
  five six seven eight
Oh! she play’d on nine pianos.

2.
Her fingers were like lobsterclaws,
Her thumbs they were both double,
And where she caught them in the keys, oh “golly” there was trouble.
Her hands were wide, so deep and thick, as red as any tanner’s;
She was the gal with mice in her hair,
And she play’d on nine piaanos.

3.
Oh couldn’t she punish pork and beans,
And oysters raw or stew,
Her size was quite respectable, and her age was twenty two;
Her lips were thick like pickled tripe, her parents taught her manners,
She was the gal to slaughter the notes,
And she play’d on nine pianos.
