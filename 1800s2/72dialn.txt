1. Darling, I am lonely now,
Tears unbidden flow for thee,
Sad thouhts till my aching brow,
Oh! I’m lonely, now, and sad as I can be;
For you’ve left me broken hearted now—
Fill’d my life with bitter pain,
And in loneliness my head I bow,
For novermore I’ll see thee here again.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Darling, I am lonely, now,
Oh! I’m lonely now, and sad as I can be.
Darling, I am lonely now,
Yes, I’m lonely since thou¹rt gone from me;
Sad thoughts fill my aching brow,
Oh! I’m lonely now, and sad as I can be.

2. Darling, I am lonely now,
In the twilight still and gray,
Oft I think of thy sweet vow,
And the happy hours in love we pass’d away;
Sweetest mem’ries round me hover love,
As I sit and dream of thee,
While the stars so sweetly shine above,
In heaven, where I long to be with thee.

3. Darling, I am lonely now,
Always thinking, love, of thee,
Sadly o’er thy grave I boy,
Ever wishing that I were in heav’n with thee;
In my dreams I often see thy form,
And thy gentle voice I hear,
But, those fleeting dreams are but a charm,
And only cause me one more silent tear.
