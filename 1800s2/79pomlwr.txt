1.
De gospel Trumpet am sounding loud,
  Put on my long white robe.
See all de children a sliping proud,
All up an’ down de road,
When dey get near de pearly gate,
  Put on my long white robe,
You can go inside if you aint too late,
And den how happy you’ll feel.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! wait ’till I put on my long white robe,
My starry crown and my golden shoes,
I pass through the gates of de golden city
Den I carry de news. Yes!
Oh! wait ’till I put on my long white robe,
My starry crown and my golden shoes,
I pass through the gates of de golden city
Den I carry de news.

2.
When de last Trumpet in de mornin’ shall sound,
  Put on my long white robe.
On de right hand I  want to be found,
Den how happy I’ll feel,
De goats on de left an’ de lambs on de right,
  Put on my long white robe,
We’ll hab mighty singin’ and shoutin’ dat night,
And den how happy I’ll feel.

3.
We’ll have a mighty dinner of milk and honey,
  Put on my long white robe.
You can come up and eat if you aint got any money,
Den how happy you’ll feel,
I gwine to have a seat in de promise land,
  Put on my long white robe,
So come along brother and join our band,
And den how happy you’ll feel.
