1. I can’t forget the happy past,
The joys of former years;
I ne’er can sing the songs of old
Except thro’ falling tears;
The love of old lives in my heart,
Tho’ life is fading fast;
I can’t forget, where’er I roam,
The bright and happy past.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I can’t forget the happy past,
The joys of former years;
I ne’er can sing the songs of old,
Except tho’ falling tears.

2. ’Tis vain to think of former years
We now can know no more,
Or seek again the joyous hours
We  passed in days of yore;
But golden thoughts of long ago
Will linger with me yet,
The one sweet dream of all my life,
My heart can ne’er forget.
