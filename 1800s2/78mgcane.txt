1. My grandfather’s cane, I remember it well,
’Twas an ebony stick, on the head was a shell,
Engraved in pure gold for the hand to embrace,
While helping assisting his faltering pace.
He was staight as an arrow, and handsome when young,
He carried no staff, he was active and strong,
But as age came upon him with trouble and pain,
A friend and support was my Grandfather’s cane.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
That ebony cane, that golden head cane, 
that trusty old cane, that my grandfather wore,
I love it, God bless it, my tears fell upon it;
For its master, grandfather, alas is no more!

2. My grandfathe’s cane, I remember it well,
It was never uplifted to force or compell
His many grandchildren to love and obey,
Believe me, that never was grandfather’s way.
His benevolent mouth and his eye always mild,
Would conquer the most disobediant child,
All the wealth in the wilde world could never obtain
As precious a relic as Grandfather’s cane.

3. My grandfather’s cane, I remember it well,
In that little white cottage far down in the dell
Where grandfather lived all the children would play,
With the goldheaded plaything on many a day.
It was used as a horse, or a spear, or a gun,
Grandfather would watch us and laugh at our fun,
In the ev’ning of life what can better sustain
My feeble old age than my Grandfather’s cane?
