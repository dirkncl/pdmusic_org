1. O, the old, old clock, of the household stock, 
Was the brightest and the dearest. 
Its hands tho’ old, had a touch of gold 
And its chimes rang still the clearest. 
’Twas a monitor too, tho’ its words were few, 
Yet they lived while nations altered. 
And its voice still strong, warned old and young, 
When the voice of friendship faltered, 
When the voice of friendship faltered.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Tick, tick it said quick, quick to bed, 
For ten, I’ve given warning: 
Up,  up and go, or else you know, 
You’ll never rise early in the morning.

2. For a friendly voice had that old, old clock,
As it stood in the corner smiling
And blest the time, with a merry chime,
The wintry hours beguiling;
But a cross old voice had this tiresome clock
When it called at daybreak boldly
When the dawn looked gray o’er the misty way
And the early air blew coldly,
And the early air blew coldly.
