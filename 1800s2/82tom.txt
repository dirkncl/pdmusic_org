Death! Death!
Away! Away!
Oh no I will not die.
Years I've toiled to gain this gold,
And with hunger I've suffered thro' wet and cold.
No! I ne'er can give my gold up!
Tho' my soul shall perish, I'll never
Ah give up my gold.
See the thieves are breaking!
They will steal my money!
Who's so bold to steal my gold and rob me of my money!
Help! oh help! in mercy! never while I have life!
ah I am lost! I am lost!
Thy will be done.
I cross the unknown sea.
Oh God I come to thee.
