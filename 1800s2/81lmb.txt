1. Bands of bright hair gently twining
’Round a sweet and winsome face,
Eyes the dewy stars outshining,
Linked with form of fairy grace.
Sweeter than the blushing roses,
Queen enough to wear a crown,
Not a thought of guile reposes,
In the heart of Mollie Brown.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dearest, Mollie, sweetest Mollie,
Always smile and never frown,
Do you know how well we love you,
Pretty little Mollie Brown?

2. From the angels as a blessing
Was our little Mollie sent,
Just for kisses and carressing,
Just for summer sunshine lent.
May her life be one of pleasure,
Darken’d by no tear or frown,
While our hearts will fondly treasure
Pretty little Mollie Brown.
