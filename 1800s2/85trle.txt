1. I know of a pretty girrl, 
So loving, kind and true, 
With ruby lips and teeth of pearl, 
And honest eyes of blue. 
She’s bright and merry, never sad, 
This charming little prize 
When first we met I saw she had, 
Such roguish laughing eyes. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Laughing eyes, yes, laughing eyes. 
Oh, my love has laughing eyes. 
With a sweet and sunny smile, 
That’s free from care and also guile 
Joyous as a little child, 
My love has laughing eyes.

2. While the roses are asleep, 
When dewdrops brightly gleam, 
Beneath the willow we did meet, 
In love’s delightful dream. 
Oh, then it fills me with delight, 
While stars shine in the skies 
To gaze upon those eyes so bright, 
Those roguish laughing eyes.
