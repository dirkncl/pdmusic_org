1. Silken tresses softly twining,
Round a sweet and winning face,
Eyes the summer stars outshining,
Fairy form of gentle grace:
Sweeter than the blushing roses,
Queen enough to wear a crown,—
Not a tho’t of guile reposes
In the heart of Mollie Brown.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Fairest Mollie, sweetest Mollie,
Always smile and never frown!
Do you know how well we love you,
Darling little Mollie Brown?

2. She’s our little household fairy,
With her tender, loving way,
And her footsteps light and airy,
Make sweet music all the day;
Joy and gladness linger near her,
Not a sigh, or tear, or frown,—
None on earth to us is dearer
Than our little Mollie Brown.

3. From the angels as a blessing,
Was our little Mollie sent,
Just for kissing and caressing,
Just for summer sunshine lent;
May her life be one of pleasures,
Darkened by no tear or frown,
While our hearts will ever treasure
Darling little Mollie Brown.
