1. Again o’er Columbia’s domain,
The dayking illumines the sky,
And glad hearts awaken the strain,
Hurrah ’tis the Fourth of July!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then sing out the dawn’s early song,
The bells peal the joyful reply,
||: The glad notes, the glad notes prolong,
Hurrah! ’tis the Fourth of July! :||

2. We’ll sing of the patriot band
Who dared the oppressor defy,
Who bid Freedom reign in our land,
And crown’d her, the Fourth of July!

3. We’ll sing of the tried and the true,
The bright roll of honor and fame,
Entwining with garlands anew,
Our Washington’s unsullied name!

4. See! beauty with chivalry vies,
And cheers greet the cannon’s amen,
Now music to music replies
The pageant advances again!

5. A cheer for the unfetter’d throng,
A cheer for our National Day,
A cheer for the Flag, loud and long,
And Union forever and aye!

6. Give grand Mississippi a voice,
Let Oregon tell to the sea,
The hills and the valleys rejoice,
And echo the shouts of the free!

ENCORE.
7. Serenely o’er calm Bunker’s Hill,
Whose rude record pierces the sky,
Our Flag floats, as proudly it will
While time marks the Fourth of July!

8. And long as that Banner shall wave,
Its Heavensent mission to fill,
The Charter that Jefferson gave,
Shall lead us to victory still.
