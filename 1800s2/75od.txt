1. One day, one day, I said unto the sea; 
“O, sad sea, O, dark sea, 
Wonderful, rolling sea! 
Tossing the spray, in merciless play, 
Will you never have pity on me?” 
But the sea no answer made; 
And the dark waves rose so high; 
Back from the spray I turned me away, 
To watch, and wait, and sigh. 
One morning in the May, 
’Mid songs blithe and glad, 
The proud ship sailed away, 
And bore my sailor lad. 
He whispered low to me, 
“I will come back to thee; 
I’ll bring thee gems, my own love, 
From o’er the rolling sea!” 
O, blue wave, O, dark wave, 
Lifting your snowy head, 
My sailor will sleep in his cradle so deep, 
Till the sea gives up its dead!

2. One day, one day, I said unto the seal; 
“O, bright sea, O, loved sea, 
Beautiful, shining sea! 
Tossing the spray, so gently today, 
You have surely had pity on me!” 
For my sailor came again, 
From across the rolling tide, 
Bringing the gems he promised to me, 
And lingring by my side. 
The proud ships sail away, 
To strange lands afar; 
I watch them come and go 
Across the harbor bar. 
But while the ships go by, 
My sailor boy is nigh; 
He’ll linger near his own love, 
Forever and for aye! 
O, blue wave, O, dark wave, 
Lifting your snowy head, 
O, dashing white spray, 
I love you today, 
For ye gave me back my dead!
