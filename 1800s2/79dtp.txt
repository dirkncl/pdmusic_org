1. The mem’ry of that glorious night, 
Will ne’er forgetten be; 
The words she whisper’d in my ear, 
Were like soft melody! 
I kiss’d her lips, so sunny bright, 
While fondly from them fell, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
“Goodnight, sweet love, don’t tell Papa! 
Remember, love, don’t tell! 
“Good night, sweet love, don’t tell Papa! 
Remember, love, don’t tell!”

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Oh, like the music of a dream, 
These words in rapture fell; 
“Goodnight, sweet love, don’t tell Papa; 
Remember, love, don’t tell!”

2. I clasp’d her little hand in mine, 
Beneath the stars, so pure; 
I told her that my love was her’s, 
While life and hopes endure. 
She gazed upon me with delight, 
And soft her accents fell,

3. That eve we spoke the loving vows, 
That made my darling mine; 
I wonder’d what had made, that night, 
The stars so brightly shine! 
Again I kiss’d the ruby lips, 
Whle words of rapture fell,
