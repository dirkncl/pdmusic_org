1. This is a world where trouble never dies, 
Thoubles ne’er come alone, 
And there never was a darkey who could enter in the skies. 
If he didn’t have a trouble of his own; 
Instead of it decreasing, 
You’ll find it never ceasing, 
In every village and in town, 
And the world is getting bigger, 
Says the cultivated nigger, 
’Cause he has a little trouble of his own. 

CHORUS 1
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own, 
And the world is getting bigger, 
Says the cultivated nigger, 
’Cause he has a little trouble of his own, 
And the world is getting bigger, 
Says the cultivated nigger, 
’Cause he has a little trouble of his own.

2. Ev’ry where you go trouble will be there; 
Even upon the throne, 
In the cabin of the darkey, in the Presidential chair, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own; 
The Philadelphia quaker, 
The darkey chicken taker, 
And they are by no means alone. 
For in ev’ry situation 
In this great and mighty nation, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own. 

CHORUS 2
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own. 
All the actors with big sal’ries, 
And the gods up in the gallerries, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own, 
All the actors with big sal’ries, 
And the gods up in the galleries, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own.

3. There is the man that carries up the hod, 
He with the slide trombone, 
And the dashing gay conductors of the Elevated road. 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own; 
There’s the hush and fishball slinger, 
And the comic opera singer, 
And the dude whose coat is in pawn, 
And ev’ry tramp and bummer 
Who are loafing all the summer, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own. 

CHORUS 3
Ev’ry boby has a trouble of his own. 
There is Jimmy, Cul and Nixie, 
Eddie Rice and Henry Dixie, 
Ev’ryboby has a trouble of his own, 
There is Jimmy, Cull and Nixey, 
Eddie Rice and Henry Dixey, 
Ev’rybody has a trouble of his own.
