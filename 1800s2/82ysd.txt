1. You’re somebody’s darling, and somebody loves you,
Somebody thinks of you both night and day,
And in the soft twilight she’s waiting to greet you,
Somebody loves you where ever you stray;
Somebody thinks of the day she first met you,
Thinks it the happy’t she ever had seen;
Yes, she is waiting and longing to greet you,
Waiting for you in the gloaming, I ween.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
You’re somebody’s darling, and somebody loves you,
Somebody’s watching by night and by day,
And longing, with smiles and with kisses to greet you,
Somebody’s lonely while you are away.

2. You’re somebody’s darling, and somebody loves you,
Somebody longs for the bright day to dawn,
That brings back her darling for whom loves grows stronger,
Waiting for him in the gloaming, I ween;
Yes, there is some one who loves you so truly
To her you are dearer than silver or gold;
Ever she waits where the dew drops are falling,
And thinks o’er the story that never grows old.
