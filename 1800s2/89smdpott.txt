1. My daughter’s as fine a young girl as you’ll meet,
In your travels day in and day out;
But she’s getting highton’d and she’s putting on airs,
Since she has been working about
When she comes home at night, from her office
She walks in with a sway like a fighter
And she tells the old lady to drop on herself,
Since my daughter plays on the Typewriter.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
She cries in her sleep your letter’s to hand.
She calls her old father esquire'
And the neighbors they shout when my daughter turns out.
There goes Bridget Typewriter Maguire.

2. She’ll not carry her lunch in a basket no more,
And she’ll not take a flask of cold tay;
For she says that she goes out to lunch with a fish,
Way down to the Bon Ton Cafe
She says that sometimes she goes out with the Boss
You can bet your sweet life he don’t slight her
For she says she can give him away to his wife,
Since my daughter plays on the Typewriter.

3. She says she’s a regular daisy,
Uses slang till my poor heart is sore;
She now warbles snatches from operas,
When she used to sing Peggy O’Moore.
Sure she’s gone to the devil entirely
She’s bleach’d her hair till it is lighter
And I’ll dance a CanCan oon the face of the man,
That taught her to play the Typewriter.
