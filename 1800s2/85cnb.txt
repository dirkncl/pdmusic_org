1. You’re all invited and the band engaged, 
And we’re going to have some fun 
For Clara Nolan gives a ball. 
This day she’s twenty one. 
We’ve borrowed knives and table cloths 
From all about the town. 
And ev’ry man must bring a chair 
If he wants to sit down. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Will you come? Will you come? 
And you never will forget it if you come 
Where the bells are ringing and the girls are singing 
And the fiddles and the harp go rum, tum, tum, 
With teazing, and pleasing and squeazing free for all, 
And courting in the cornners at Miss Clara Nolan’s Ball.

2. Old Casey’s coming with his Irish pipes 
And fiddler Neary too. 
They’ll play you the Maria waltz 
And likewise Peekaboo. 
Of course it’s not the Hoffman House. 
Just walk inside the door. 
If there’s no place to hang your hats. 
Just hang them on the floor.

3. The dance commences when the clock strikes ten 
And we’ll keep it up till day. 
There will be no collection the Expenses to defray. 
We’ve Bourbon, Rye and Lager beer 
And Philadelphia Ale. 
And if the keg gets empty we’ll 
Go out and fill the pail.
