1. Oh child come to me and just sit down by my knee, 
I’ll tell that same old story just once more; 
Of dark, clouded years, oh, so full of bitter tears, 
In those bondage days of long before the war. 
In ricefield and in cane, there the black man felt the pain, 
The drivers whip it cut him ev’ry day; 
Our good Lord above, with his never dying love, 
Made that cruel, cruel slavery pass’d away.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh shout Hallelujah, Freedom ever rules the land, 
Go bend your knee, black people for to pray; 
The shackle and the band has fell from the Bondsman’s hand, 
And that cruel, cruel slavery’s pass’d away.

2. Oh child, in those times then I liv’d among the pines, 
Yes, in an old log cabin I was born; 
Then I heard the moan when the mothers lost their own, 
In those bondage days, of thank the Lord they’re gone. 
That Iron chain and band they grow rusty in this land, 
No more the blood hound hold the slave at bay; 
So we bend the knee to the Lord that made us free, 
For that cruel, cruel slavery pass’d away.

3. Oh I don’t complain, it will never come again, 
So all our little children, black and brown; 
They ne’er can be sold for that yellow shining gold, 
For sweet Freedom, child, she has put on her crown. 
She come here in the night, oh then might gave in to right, 
Old Ab’ra’m Lincold brought about the day; 
So shout Hallelu— there’s a lot of work to do, 
For that cruel, cruel slavery pass’d away.
