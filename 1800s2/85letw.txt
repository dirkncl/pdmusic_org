1. O! gift from far beyond the sea,
Thine, glorious land of Lafayette;
Proud Symbol of sweet Liberty,
Which at Columbia’s gates we set,
A greeting to our sister land.
We waft across the deep afar;
Long linked in Friendship may we stand,
With Freedom still our guiding star.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sister Republic o’er the sea,
To thee we pledge a nation’s love;
May Freedom, Peace, and Amity,
May Freedom, Peace, and Amity,
May Freedom, Peace, and Amity,
Shine o’er thee as the stars above.

2. ’Twas thine when fought our sires of old,
To aid thee in the Holy strife;
Thy voice our destiny foretold,
Thy Friendship nourish’d Freedoms life.
O sacred symbol, grand and proud.
’Till countless ages wing their flight;
To every nation tyrant bow’d,
Thy torch shall flame God’s beacon light.

3. Thy gift shall speak to every clime,
Of Liberty’s resistless sway;
It’s deathless voice througout all thine,
To Tyrant hearts shall hurl dismay.
Long, shall our children’s children prize,
Aye, while our flag of Stars shall wave;
The hearts that bade this symbol rise,
The noble patriot hands that gave.

4. A greeting from our hills of pine,
A greeting from our prairies wide;
From storied mountains that enshrine,
Our heritage of hope and pride.
To thee fair land of France we send.
Oh! by the gift close link’d are we;
’Till time forevermore shall end,
One heart in glorious Liberty.
