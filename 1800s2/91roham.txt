1. How my mind oft wanders back, to my dear old home and mother,
And the recollections where my boyhood days were spent,
How I play’d from morn till night, on that dear old home and farm,
Oh! those days how happy, when I think of home and mother,
Oh! how the birds sang their lay, and the whipowill would echo
Their songs at night oh! those were the days I loved so well,
When I recollect my dear old home and mother.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh my dear old home far away, home I lov’d so well,
And the many happy days I used to spend,
Oh! those were the days I lov’d so well,
When I recollect my dear old home and mother.

2. How I often wonder if the old home looks just the same now,
When I left that dear old homestead when I was a boy,
How I used to work and toil, on that dear old home and farm,
When I recollect my dear old home long years ago,
No! never will I regret, of the days I used to spend on
The old homestead, it makes me feel sad and lonely now,
When I recollect my dear old home and mother.

3. But one day a message came, from my dear old home and mother,
How well I remember, what that message to me said,
It told me to come right home, for my mother she was sick,
Oh! how sand my journey was, when to my home I went,
But never will I forget, when we laid her in the churchyard,
Beneath the trees, in heaven above our mother is gone,
When I recollect my dear old home and mother.
