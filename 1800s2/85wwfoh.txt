1. We weep for our Hero, who’s gone to his rest,
Where nought shall disturb the peace of his breast;
In the tomb may his form in repose there remain,
While our country for ages, his fame will proclaim.
In all his fierce contests he strove not for fame,
But simply his country once more to regain;
Sweet freedom and peace to our nation he brought,
Through years of hard struggles and battles well fought.

2, When our homes were all threaten’d, with darkness o’erspread,
And kindred were scatter’d with sorrow and dread;
By his triumphs in war, he vanquished the foe,
And saved our dear land from ruin and woe,
On his monument high we’ll sulpture his name,
To show to the world his greatness and fame;
And the tears of our land will water his grave,
For the vict’ries he won, our country to save.
