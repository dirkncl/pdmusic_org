1.
FRIEND PAUL
Oh tell me, Job Gray, why you never look sad,
Why your face has no wrinlles of care,
Fourscore years and more you have lived, I am told,
And of sorrow you’ve had your full share,

JOB GRAY
Friend Paul, ’tis a secret that gold cannot buy,
But that all men may have if they will;
Precious stones cannot purchase the favor you crave,
Though your coffers with treasures be filled.

2.
FRIEND PAUL
But will you not tell me your secret, Job Gray,
For I fain would be happy like you,
When time has silvered my hair with its touch
And I’ve traveled life’s journey most through,

JOB GRAY
Friend Paul, I will tell you, take heed to my word,
Do by all as you would be done by;
Keep the path that our good Master points out to you,
And pass all iniquity by.

3.
JOB GRAY
Then if others should sin and your good aims pervert,
And your fair fame endeavor to blight,
Trust in God, and his strong arm will lead you safe though,
As long as you do what is right.

4.
FRIEND PAUL
And is this the motto you’ve folglowed, Job Gray,
And does this make your old heart so light?

5.
JOB GRAY
Yes, Paul, I have tried in my poor humble way,
To e’er keep in the path that was rght;
And when sorrow has come and the burden was hard,
And misfortune my efforts befell
I accepted the rod and I bowed to His will,
For He doeth, Paul, every thing well.

6.
FRIEND PAUL
Then I’ll follow your precepts, my good friend, Job Gray,
For my heart longs to do what is right.

DUET
Then we’ll meet in the land without sorrow,
(Job Gray.) (Friend Paul.)
And dwell in the mansions of light.
And dwell in the mansions of light.
