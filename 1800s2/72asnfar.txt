1.
I like a game at Croquet or bowling on the green
I like a little boating to pull against the stream.
But of all the games that I love best to fill me with deight
I could like to take a ramble upon a starry night.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
A starry night for a ramble
In a flow'ry dell
Thro' the bush and bramble
Kiss and never tell.

2.
Talk about your bathing or strolling on the sands
Or some unseen verrandah where gentle zephyr fans
Or rolling home in the morning boys and very nearly tight
Could never beat a ramble upon a starry night.

3.
I like to take my sweetheart "of course you would" said he
And softly whisper in her ear "how dearly I love you"
And when you picture to yourselves the scenes of such delight
You'll want to take a ramble upon a starry night.

4.
Some wil choose velocipede and others take a drive
And some will set and mope at home half dead and half alive
And some will choose a steamboat and others even fight
But I'll enjoy my ramble upon a starry night.
