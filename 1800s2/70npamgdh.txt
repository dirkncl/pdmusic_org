1. In this sensation century good songs are very few,
The words are little cared for if the  music is but new,
And subjects they are hard to find, yet I’ve one left me still,
Its never push a man because he’s going down the hill.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then  
Help one another, boys, should fortune on you shine,
Remember when you give you mite, that poverty’s no crime,
Tho’ little be the off’ring, boys, give it with good will,
But never push a man because he’s going down the hill.

2. We very often find a man with brave and honest heart,
Who far his wife and children’s sake in trade will try to start,
But still his aims he does not gain, tho’ work which way he will,
For fate it seems against him, and he’s going down the hill.  

3. Oh! as we journey on thro’ life, how many men we find,
To think that poverty’s a sin are very much inclin’d,
They meet in dad adversity some old friend Tom or Bill,
But pass him by disdainfully, he’s going down the hill. 

4. Oh! when you meet an honest man, that’s struggling hard with fate,
Oh ne’er for once discourage him, nor tell him “’tis too late,”
Don’t steer or frown as him you pass, but help him with a will,
Perhaps some day you’ll meet him on the summit of the hill.
