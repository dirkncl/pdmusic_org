1. Little feet that putter,
Down the entry stair,
Little hands that scatter
Roses ev’rywhere;
Voice that sounds so merry
In the morning air,
Lips, so like a cherry,
Locks of golden hair.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
O, what sounds are sweeter,
Floating on the air,
Than thy merry music
Coming down the stair.

2. Eyes as bright as berries
On the mountain side,
Lips and cheeks like cherries,
Golden hair, blueeyed,
How I long to meet you,
And to greet you there,
Full of rosy laughter,
Coming down the stair.

3. Come and kiss your mother
When you older grow,
Do you think another
Ever’ll love you so?
Who, my child, will meet you,
When I am not there?
Who will wait to greet you,
Coming down the stair?
