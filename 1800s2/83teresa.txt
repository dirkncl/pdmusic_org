Teresa, Teresa, 
Come my darling one. 
I wait beside the Hall. 
The moon is in its zenith. 
Haste, no danger will befall. 
My trusty craft will bear us both 
Tonight yes far away. 
Oh leave the Palace, come with me, 
Be happy night and day. 
Oh, list to the mandolins, 
Sweet charming mandolins. 
Bright stars are shining and 
Full is the moon. 
Let not thy thoughts ponder, 
With me come and wander 
The sweet path of life
In the lov’d month of June. 
My lov’d one, come my darling one, 
I wait beside the Hall. 
The moon is in its zenith. 
Haste, no danger will befall. 
My trusty craft will bear us both 
Tonight yes far away. 
Oh leave the Palace, come with me. 
Be happy night and day. 
But gladly now, I hear the rustling softly. 
Now thy footsteps fall. 
Now I see my only treasure 
Coming along beside the wall. 
Joyous greetings, fond hearts meeting, 
Clouds of night pass o’er us now. 
I will steer thee, never fear me, 
To a happy home I vow. 
Teresa come my darling one 
I wait beside the Hall. 
The moon is in its zenith 
Haste no danger will befall.
My trusty craft will bear us both 
Tonight yes far away. 
Oh leave the Palace, 
Come with me, 
Be happy night and day.
