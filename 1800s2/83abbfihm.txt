1.
While plodding on our way, the toilsome road of life,
  How few the friends that daily there we meet!
No many will stand by in trouble and in strife,
  With counsel and affection ever sweet!
But there is on whose smile, will ever on us beam,
  Whose love is dearer than any other
And wherever we may turn,
This lesson we will learn,
  A boy's best friend is his Mother.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then cherish her with care,
And smooth her silv'ry hair,
When gone you will never get another.
And wherever we may turn,
This lesson we shall learn,
A boy's best friend is his Mother.

2.
Tho' all the world may frown, and ev'ry friend depart,
  She never will forsake us in our need!
Our refuge evermore is still within our heart,
 For us her loving sympathy will plead!
Her pure and gentle smile, for ever cheers our way,
  'Tis sweeter and 'tis purer than all other.
When she goes from earth away,
We'll find our while we stray,
  A boy's best friend is his Mother.

3.
Her fond and gentle face not long may greet us here,
  Then cheer her with our kindness and our love!
Remember at her knee in childhood bright and dear,
  We heard her voice, like angel's from above.
Tho' after years may bring, their gladness or their woe,
  Her love is sweeter far than any other.
And our longing heart will learn,
Wherever we may turn,
  A boy's best friend is his Mother.
