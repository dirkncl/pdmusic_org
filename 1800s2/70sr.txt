1. Near a cool and shady woodland,
Where the rippling streamlets flow,
Dwelt a maiden, kind and lovely,
But ’twas in the long ago.
Oft I kissed her and caressed her,
As we danced the hours away,
Oft I told her that I loved her,
But she’s dead, my Sadie Ray.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oft I kissed her and caressed her,
As we danced the hours away,
Oft I told her that I loved her,
But she’s dead, my Sadie Ray.

2. When at eve the golden sunset,
Ushered in the moon and stars,
Arm in arm we walked together,
To the gate of chestnut bars.
Here we talked of future pleasures,
Here I named our wedding day,
But alas, ’tis long in coming,
For she’s dead, my Sadie Ray.

3. In my dreams I see her smiling
Far above the clear blue sky,
She is kneeling to the angels,
Who in groups are standing by.
Then again, I hear her calling,
“Come my darling, come I say,
There is room here for another,
Come and kiss your Sadie Ray.”
