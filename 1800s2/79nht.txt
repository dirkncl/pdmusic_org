1. 
All day I’ve been trying for something to do, 
I ask it   from all that I meet. 
I gave the last penny I had in the world, 
To buy me a morsel to eat. 
O pity and help me, the night is so cold, 
And here I am starving, yes starving for bread, 
A stranger and friendless, I wander alone, 
With nowhere to lay my poor head.

CHORUS
Dear Father and Mother, Sister and Brother, 
Bitter the tears that in sorrow I shed, 
Ah! little you dream I am homeless tonight, 
With nowhere to lay my poor head.

2. 
I look at the wealhy who pass me with scorn,
Nor envy the young or the gay.
But oh! I remember the time is not long,
When I was as happy as they.
Though little of comfort our dwelling could boast,
And frugal and sparing our table was spread,
I never have felt what I suffer tonight,
With nowhere to lay my poor head.

3. 
“I’ve tried to be cheerful through hunger and want,
But now I can bear it no more!”
His features grew livid, exhausted and weak,
He sank at the steps of a door.
It seemed for a moment that help was too late,
That life from his bosom had fled,
That God in his mercy had called him to rest,
And pillowed his poor weary head.

4. 
A christian disciple bent over his form
In tender compassion and love,
He sought to restore him, he murmured a prayer,
Twas heard by our father above.
The stranger in friendship a welcome had found,
The sunlight of joy o’er his pathway is shed,
Nor wanders he lonely and homeless by night,
With nowhere to lay his poor head.
