1. Sad and hopeless weak and weary,
  Thro’ the streets each day I go;
Lone and helpless Oh, how dreary
  Seems to me this world below!
Gentle stranger hear my pleading
  Do not idly pass me by.
Worn and footsore, pity needing,
  Hear, Oh, hear my bitter sigh.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Little Mary, sad and lonely,
Forc’d to beg from door to door;
Give, Oh, give me one penny only,
She will bless you evermore!

2. Once so happy friends were near me,
  Mother’s arms were round me thrown;
Flow’rs of Springtime come to cheer me,
  Now they’ve left me all alone.
Storms of Winter whistle by me
  Plodding on with weary feet.
Help, kind stranger, don’t deny me,
  Give, Oh, give me food to eat!

3. Dark the shadows, while I wander,
  Gather ’round me everywhere;
Stars are shining, over yonder,
  In that land so blest and fair,
Gentle Angels, fondly take me
  From the world so drear and sad;
Bear me onward ne’er forsake me,
  Where the wretched may be glad!
