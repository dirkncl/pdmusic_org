1. O the dear old farm, where youths happy days were spent, 
Where in ignorance so blissful, I was with the world content, 
I can see my sainted mother, in her ancient rocking chair, 
In her busy hands her knitting, and the frost upon her hair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O the daisy spangled meadow spreads before me fresh and green 
And the buttercups so yellow are the brightest ever seen 
And the twitter of the swallow from its nest within the barn 
These are gems in mem’ry’s casket from the dear old farm.

2. There are sunny slopes and hillsides dotted o’er with grazing kiss, 
There are trollises and arbors, covered o’er with slinging vines, 
There are blushing fields of clover, and there’s golden waving grain, 
There are dells where saucy  echo, backward flings your call again.

3. There was winsome neighbor Bessie, who won my boyish heart, 
But ’mid the shifting scenes of life, we’ve drifted far apart, 
I wonder of she backward looks, across life’s changing sea, 
And gives a thought to the dear old farm, or ever thinks of me.
