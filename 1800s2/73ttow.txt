Written in commemoration of the second winning of the L [British pound] 1000 prize
by the South Wales Choral Union 1874.

1. A challenge went forth
To South and to North
Of Gwalia the brave and the Strong.
To gather for fight
In the Palace of Light
And strive in the contest of Song.
Sweet voices had they
Who form’d for the fray
From Cambria’s fair mountains and vales.
Tho’ none dared compete,
Success was complete.
They gain’d The grand Trophy.
The Trophy of Wales.

CHORUS 1
Tho’ none dare compete
Success was complete
They gain’d The grand Trophy
The Trophy of Wales.

2. The challenge renew’d
With valour imbued
The hosts of Caradog must go
As giants combine
Refresh’d with some wine
To meet no contemptible foe.
So thus in their might
To the Palace of Light
They rush from the mountains and dales.
Not striving in vain
They conquer again
And win The grand Trophy,
The Trophy of Wales.

CHORUS 2
Not striving in vain
They conquer again
And win The grand Trophy
The Trophy of Wales.

3. No longer we hide
A Nations just pride,
For glory now makes us elate
When honour is won
In the face of the sun
Let fame be the crown of the great
While Cambria’s proud name
With royal acclaim,
Like Magic o’er Britain prevails.
The wide world about shall echo the shout,
We hold the grand Trophy
The Trophy of Wales.

CHORUS 3
The wide world about
Shall echo the shout,
We hold the grand Trophy
The Trophy of Wales.
