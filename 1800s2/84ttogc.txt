1. With reverence we raise the lid 
Of Grandma6s chest so brown and old, 
For well we know what here are hid 
Some things more precious far than gold, 
We know that Grandma loved them all 
And put them one by one away, 
For some would to her mind recall 
The pleasures of a faroff day.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O ’twas an old and goodly store 
Of curious things we loved the best, 
How carefully we took them o’er 
The treasures of our Grandma’s chest.

2. Here is the workbag carried oft
Upon her dainty girlish arm,
’Tis made of beads and velvet soft
And has for us a double charm,
For here’s a wellworn needlebook
Some fine old needles still are there,
And in the cover while we look
We find a lock of shining hair.

3. Here is the sampler that she made
In early years by patient skill,
The flow’rs she wrought here do not fade
The roses keep their beauty still,
Some buds and sprigs of ever green
Twined in a knot of silken lace
Were once by her admirers seen
To deck the beauty of her face.

4. Here, bound with ribbon soft and white
Is what she prized all things above;
A bunch of letters stain’d with blight,
Where Grandpa told her of his love,
’Tis here we find the golden ring
She proudly wore when she was wed,
How many thoughts from this will spring
For both are sleeping with the dead.
