1. Oh, a satin dress you must confess,
Is charming, gay and pretty,
For it takes the eye, as you pass by,
And decks the proud and witty;
But there’s one I know that makes a show
Just like a flower garden,
And the girl I love all earth  above,
She wears a “Dolly Varden!”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, she’s gay and bright, my heart’s delight!
She looks just like a garden,
This girl I love all earth above,
Dressed in a “Dolly Varden!”

2. Now we met by chance, her winning glance,
It made my bosom flutter;
And she looked so sweet, and so petite,
I scarce knew what to utter;
But I fondly said, as she turned her head,
“Dear girl I beg your pardon,”
“But you’re just the pet, the loveliest yet,”
Dressed in that “Dolly Varden!”

3. Like the morning dew, or skies of blue,
Like stars of evening beaming,—
Like a lovely pearl my little girl,
Her eyes so softly gleaming!
Oh, she’ll soon be mine, and her love divine
Will make my heart a garden!
And her wedding dress, as you may guess
Shall be a “Dolly Varden!”
