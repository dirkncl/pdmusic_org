1. Would you kiss me again Little Darling,
And lay your sweet head on my breast,
The same as you did when the robbins
Were singing their young ones to rest;
Would you touch your soft lips to my cheek, love,
Or whisper as gentle and low,
As when we were courting that evening,
In summer, so long, long ago.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Would you kiss me [once] again Little Darling,
Or whisper as [sweet] gentle and low,
As when we were courting [on] that [eve,] evening,
In the summer so [long,] long [ago,] ago.

2. Would you kiss me again Little Darling,
And rest your pink cheek ’gainst my own,
The same as you did ’neath the cypress,
That evening we sat there alone;
Would you twine your white arms ’bout my neck, love,
Or steal now and then a caress,
And could I successfully capture
A ringlet from one little tress. 

3. Would you kiss me again Little Darling,
And tell me that legend of old,
The same as you did when the crickets
Were chirping about us so bold;
Would you tell me again that you love me,
Or sing me that sweet pretty song,
Oh, could I again, Little Darling,
Be with you the bright summer long.
