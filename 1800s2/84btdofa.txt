1. Beneath the dear old flag again 
We march a patriot band 
In answer to the bugle call, 
That’s ringing thro the land. 
Each loyal heart with hope is rife, 
We love our country still. 
And to defend her precious life, 
We’re coming with a will.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
With Blaine and with Logan then, 
To lead us thro’ the fray, 
Beneath the dear old flag again, 
We’re bound to win the day.

2. Beneath  the dear old flag again 
The fight we’er bound to win 
Our leaders they are trusty men 
And we will put them in. 
Senate hall and battle field 
Amid the trials there 
Men have stood, nor would they yield, 
Tho’ others might despair.

3. In senate halls we’ve heard Blaine’s voice 
Ring forth in eloquence 
That had a nation’s heart rejoice, 
When raised in its defense, 
And to reward this honored son, 
Our energies are bent, 
And when the victory is won, 
He’ll be our President.
