1. Ben Gray is a blacksmith stout and strong, 
He is happy, gay  and free, 
His hair is long and his arms they are strong 
And a stalwart frame has he, 
And this is his maxim as onward he toils 
At his anvil the livelong day, 
He is jolly and kind, no better you’ll find 
Than the black  smith, old Ben Gray.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
With a ding, ding, dang, 
And a loud cling, clang, 
Oh, how merrily, the time flies away, 
This you hear him sing and the anvil ring, 
“I’m the merry old smith, Ben Gray.” 

2. At early dawn he is up, with a will.
To his work he will cheerfully go, 
The anvil rings as he joyfully sings, 
“I care not for friend or foe,” 
Now this is the life that the blacksmith leads 
Week in and week out he is there 
As happy and free as man can be, 
In the whoie wide world not a care.
