1. My heart’s bowed down with weight of woe, 
I ne’er such care and grief did know, 
And now my darling one is sleeping, 
Down where the violets grow. 
But why in grief should I repine, 
Since ’tis the will Divine? 
And in yon heav’n her home above, 
She’s waiting now to welcome me. 

2. My heart with grief is almost breaking, 
Her bright brown eyes I do so miss, 
With loving words to gently guide me, 
My life was one long dream of bliss. 
’Tis sad to be thus parted, 
When life was all to live, 
And death has left such bitter anguish, 
With nought but sorrow to give. 

3. But she had only gone before me 
To yonder heav’n so bright and fair, 
Where soon, oh soon I shall join her 
Above this world of pain and care; 
And with my darling there I’ll be, 
In the land with streets of gold, 
While wand’ring thro’ celestial bowers, 
Our dream of love will be retold.
