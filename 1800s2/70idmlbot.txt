1. I dreamt my little boy of thee. 
Whilst thou wert lying snug and warm. 
Within thy tiny bed last night 
In slumbers free from ev’ry harm. 
I’d sat beside thy little couch. 
And watch’d thee sleeping peacefully. 
And when my weary eyes were closed, 
I dreamt my little boy of thee.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Bright were my dreams so calm and bright 
Visions of angels I could see 
Whilst thou wert sleeping thro’ the night 
I dreamt my little boy of thee. 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Bright were my dreams, so calm and bright 
Visions of angels I could see, 
Whilst thou wert sleeping through the night 
I dreamt my little boy of thee. 

2. I dreamt my little boy of thee. 
And thought that angels, fair and bright, 
Were watching round thy little bed 
To guard thee till the morning’s light. 
I heard their voices singing low 
An olden song so dear to me. 
And oh! it was a pleasant dream 
I dreamt my little boy of thee.

3. I dreamt my little boy of thee. 
And saw thee in thy manhood’s days. 
And knew that He who rules all hearts 
Had kept thy soul in righteous ways, 
So “may He guide thee to the end” 
Is what I pray on bended knee; 
Oh may that happy dream come true 
I dreamt my little boy of thee.
