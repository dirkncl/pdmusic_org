1. America, I love the name,
’Tis music to the ear;
It puts grim tyranny to shame,
And dries the captive’s tear,
It bids the weary and oppres’d
From thraldom to be free;
It stirs within the loyal breast
A thrill of ecstasy.
America, America, land of the free!
Still may thy name a synonym of freedom be.

2. America, thy flag I love,
Its white and crimson bars;
Its azure from the skies above,
Its galaxy of stars.
No fairer flag in all the world
Upon the breezes rides.
Where e’er thy banner is unfurl’d,
There liberty abides.
America, America, land of the free!
Long may thy flag an emblem be of liberty.

3. America, I love to boast,
About thy vast extent.
A mighty ocean guards each coast,
Thy breadth a continent.
Thy fertile fields abundance grow,
Exhaustless are thy mines.
Bless’d country; milk and honey flow
Within thy wide confines.
America, America, land of the free!
Greatest of nations ever may’st thou be.
