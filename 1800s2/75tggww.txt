1. The golden grain was waving in the gentle harvest breeze.
The birds were singing sweetly, in their bow’rs amid the trees,
Fair nature, deck’d in brightest hues, o’er wood and meadow green,
Seem’d to reign in regal splendor, a charming fairy queen.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The golden grain was waving,
As with nature, lovely maid,
Hand in hand I went a straying
Thru’ field and forest glade.

2. The golden grain, her tresses, were dipped in morning dew,
While ’neath her drooping eyelids, shone the heavens’ transcendent blue.
Her form, the streamlet’s graceful curve; her step, the fawn’s light tread;
Her kiss, the flowers’ rich perfume that all around was shed.

3. Who takes fair nature for his love, a maiden coy shall find,
Her tears may fall, her love grow cold, but only for a time;
For, like a dainty lassie when the sun’s bright rays are seen,
She will smile in radiant beauty, his loved and chosen queen.
