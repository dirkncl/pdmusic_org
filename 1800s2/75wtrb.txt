1. Soft the wind blows o’er the woodland
Sweetly sings the Lark in tune
While the streamlets add their music
When the Roses, the Rosses bloom.

2.
Autumns russet leafy dressing
Frost and cold and winter's gloom
All have vanished in the season
When the Roses. the Roses bloom.

3.
With that joy I wait the coming
Of the balmy scented June.
She has promised that she’ll wed me
When the Roses, the Roses bloom.
