1.
There's brav'ry in battle, when cannons resound,
And men who in shipwreck are steady and cool;
But never has an equal been found
To the courage and brav'ry of Phelim O'Toole.

He's brave and he's gallant without knowing why;
He cares not for science; he cares not for rule;
His philosphy's this: To save, he will die;
There is but one Phelim, and he's an O'Toole!

2.
To save helpless women, at the word of command,
He bravely came forward, for duty he strives;
Ascending the ladder, his life in his hand,
Defying the fire fiend, while hope now survives.

Brave Phelim O'Toole mounts higher and higher,
And reaches the high elevation at last;
He bears fainting women from toruring fire
Down the perilous ladder the danger is past.

3.
Full many an ev'ning these girls have all sought,
The angels of mercy in heavenly glow;
They never imagined, the never once thought,
An angel of safety would come from below.

The example of brav'ry, where can it be learned?
Who is the teacher? where is the school?
Where can the highest position be earn'd?
Go take you first lesson from Phelim O'Toole!

4.
He'll tell you in heaven he always relies,
And then calmly waits for duty to call;
When time comes for action, grim death he defies,
No dangers deter him, no terrors appal.

When others are losing their reasoning powers,
Be watchful and careful, be steady, keep cool;
Care not tho' ev'ry one falters and cow'rs,
But march boldly forward like Phelim O'Toole.
