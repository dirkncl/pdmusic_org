1. My mistress is dead and I cannot sing, 
She had left me we’ve parted for ever, 
She’ gone to abide with her heav’nly King. 
Shall I ne’er again see her? no never: 
Her last words to me were both sad and lone, 
I was perch’d by her side on the bed. 
She said to me  “birdie, I’m going home 
When her gentle voice stayed She was dead.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh birdie hush! you worry me 
How kindly the words were spoken, 
but now is broken. 
Were she with me I’d happy be 
but now my sad heart is broken. 

2. I’ll sing never more; my mistress is gone, 
I will lead a loe life in my sorrows; 
I’ll ne’er again see her as time passes on 
Though my grief like to day is to morrow. 
Did I only know where her cold grave lies. 
I would there pay my tribute of love, 
I’d there drop my tears, love’s tend’resttie 
And I’d watch tho’ her spirits above. 

3. I’ll never forget the words she last said,
As she lay in her death bed while weeping
She said, that she wished, when she should be dead,
That I over her grave would be sleeping.
But I never shall find the sacred place
Where my dear little mistress lies sleeping.
And never again shall I see her face
And never shall cease my weeping.
