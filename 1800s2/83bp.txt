1. Long ago, long ago, 
So the story goes 
Little maids never played 
With the naughty beaus, 
But there was one called “Little Bo-Peep,” 
Belov’d by a little Boy Blue 
And they sat together and watch’d some sheep, 
For they’d nothing else to do. 
“See the sheep in the meadow,” says she, 
“And the cows in the corn,” says he, 
And this is the song he sang.

CHORUSes 1 and 2
La-ah-oo, la-ah-oo, La-ah La-ah-oo, La-ah-oo, 
Charming Little Bo-Peep.

2. Long ago, long ago,
Sheep would run away,
While the maids went to sleep
All among the hay,
And ev’ry laddie carried a horn,
’Twas quite the right thing to do,
And loudly echoed the serenade,
From the horn this little boy blew.
“’Tis the sheep in the meadow,” says she,
“You’re mistaken, it’s me,” says he,
And this is the song he sang.

3. Long ago, long ago,
So the wise declare,
Angry dames, on their brooms,
Rode up in the air.
Now who should come but a flying old witch,
And “How do you do!” says she,
”I think you’d better go home, my dears,
So come along with me,”
Then she laughed and she chuckled, ho, ho,
And she carried them off, he, he,
And up in the air they sang.

CHORUS 3
La-ah-oo, la-ah-oo, La-ah La-ah-oo, La-ah-oo, 
Where, oh, where are my sheep?
