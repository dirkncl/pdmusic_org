1. Jenny, my own true loved one,
  I’m going far from thee,
Out on the bounding billows,
  Out on the dark blue sea.
How I will miss you, my darling,
  There when the storm is raging high,
Jenny, my own true loved one,
  Wait ’till the clouds roll by.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Wait till the clouds roll by, Jenny,
  Wait till the clouds roll by;
Jenny, my own true loved one,
  Wait till the clouds roll by.

2. Jenny, when far from thee, love,
  I’m on the ocean deep,
Will you then dream of me? love,
  Will you your promise keep?
And will I come to you, darling?
  Take courage, dear, and never sigh,
Gladness will follow sorrow,
  Wait ’till the clouds roll by.

3. Jenny, I’ll keep your image
  Within my heart so true,
Each thought of mine forever
  Still, love, shall be of you;
Dry then your teardrops, my darling,
  Soon will the night of sorrow fly;
Cheer up, and don’t be l;onely,
  Wait ’till the clouds roll by.
