1. Arise! ye shades of our heroes so glorious!
Hover over this famehallow’d sod.
And let the bright heavn’s resounding victorious.
Hear our praises to Liberty’s God!
Behold! from hills that are vineclad, the tribute
That is wafted far over the sea!
Oh, hail the light from you sister star beaming,
’Tis the pure light of sweet Liberty!

[REFRAIN and CHORUS, each sung after each VERSE]
Let songs arise
’Neath Freedom’s skies!
In Fame’s advance,
Twin daughters, fair,
America and France!

2. Behold the pure, sacred shrine, blessed Freedom!
Mark the names, there like bright jewels set!
In living lustre, their glory unfading:
Noble Washington, brave Lafayette!
O’er Roshambeau’s grand and Famelaurel’d pillow
Is thy tricolor brightly unfurl’d!
One noble purpose our furtunes uniting,
Fair Republic, of yon olden world!

3. On, on to triumphs yet grander and prouder.
Still united in heart and in hand!
The hope, the joy of earth’s downtrodden millions,
In the sunlight of Freedom ye stand!
Oh, in the lapse of the ages so glorious.
May our bond be belov’d Liberty!
As now our flags in sweet sisterhood twining.
Fair Republic, far over the sea!
