[CHORUS]
Go to sleep, mother, 
While I watch and pray, 
And I’ll sing the little songs you once sang to me. 
Go to sleep, mother, 
While I watch in pray’r, 
Remember the angels will be kind to you there. 

1. There were cherries ripe and little boy blue, 
Hushabye, baby, and violets too, 
Ride a rockhorse to Danbury crow, 
And then one, two, come buckle my shoe. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Go to sleep, moth er, 
While I work and pray, 
And I’ll sing the little songs you once sang to me. 
Go to sleep, mother, 
While I watch in pray’r, 
Remember the angels will be kind to you then.

2. Your poor heart is sad and I am tired too, 
Rest a little, mamma, while I sing to you. 
Up in a tree a noble I see, 
Singing sweet songs to you and me.
