1.  Strike the fiddle, blow the horn, 
I’m going away tomorrow morn, 
To Philadelphia; they’ve sent for me 
To be on hand for the Jubilee, 
I’m going to start on the curly train, 
But I am coming back again; 
Give my love to Maria Jane,— 
Goodbye,  boys, goodbye.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
[2nd time sung through a paper horn]
Goodbye, Uncle Caleb, 
Now all shake hands with me, 
I’m going to the Quaker city, 
To be at the Jubilee.

2. Then hurry up for tomorrow morn, 
And I’ll be off when they blow the horn; 
The great Centennial to oversee, 
That is why they’ve sent for me. 
You’ll find me at the outer gate,— 
I’m going to represent the state. 
On me depends the country’s fate,— 
Goodby, boys, goodbye.

3. I’ve got a great many things to do, 
To put this  little job straight through; 
For ev’ry nation on the land, 
I intend to have a private stand; 
And when you hear the bustle hum, 
Just think Independence day has come, 
Blow the fife and beat the drum,— 
Hurrah, boys, hurrah.

4. ’Twas seven tysix, the fourth of July,  
The British felt the ’Bluttail fly;” 
One hundred years, just think of that,— 
Now swing once more your broadbrimed hat 
At the Quaker city you all must be,— 
Then come and go along with me, 
’Tis the year of Jubilee,— 
Hurrah, boys, hurrah.
