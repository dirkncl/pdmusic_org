1. Here I am as sweet as honey,
Sorry me! but then it’s funny!
Never mind where I do go,
With the rake or with the hoe,
They keep me at it all day long,
First with dance and then with song;
It’s no use talking, you can see—
They can’t let this darkey be!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! stop that music— let me be!
Don’t you see it tickles me?
First it’s heel and then its toe,
Yes, I’m always on the go!
White folks don’t you pity me!
Can’t you let this Darkey be?

2. I’m in love with Rosa fair,
She picks the cotton over there,
Her nose is flat, her lips hung down,
She’s the prettiest girl in town,
And when I out a walking go,
The darkies they do stare me so,—
Oh, this it is what worries me,
They can’t let this darkey be!

3. T’other night while at the ball,
With darkies all both great and small,
There it was I had no care,
I was with my Rosa there!
The boys began to dance and sing,
They made the bones and banjo ring.
Oh, then ’twas up with Rose and me,
They could’nt let this darkey be!
