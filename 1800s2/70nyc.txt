1. All hail the new born king!
His subjects all are we;
Loud let the chorus ring,
With Love and Loyalty.
We’ll crown wioth chaplets gay,
The youngest born of Time,
And pledge his natal day
In bowls of ruby wine.

CHORUS 1.
A charge your glasses, boys,
And fill them to the brim.
Time grants all earthly joys,
Let’s drink a health, a health to him.

2. Oh! New Year, bold and bright,
Thy advent here we hail,
Nor murmur that our sight
Cannot thy fates unvail,
We’ll seize the good we may,
We’ll bear the ills we must,
We’ll joyful be today,
The furure we will trust.

CHORUS 2.
With wine our glasses glow,
We’ve fill’d them to the brim.
Time heals all earthly woe,
So here’s a health, a health to him.
