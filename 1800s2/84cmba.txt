1. He said, “GoodBye;” these parting words were spoken: 
“I leave you now. Perhaps ’tis better so.” 
He gave me back each tender little token, 
And far across the seas he then did go. 
But in my heart he ne’er can be a stranger, 
For love like mine has sufer’d pain, 
And when his love has conquer’d pride and anger, 
I know that he will call me back again. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Call me back again, 
Call me back again; 
Ah, when his love has conquer’d pride and anger, 
I know that he will call me back again.

2. When sad and lone, he’ll think with fond emotion 
Of all the hopes and all the gladness fled! 
And in each dream, afar across the ocean, 
His heart will weep o’er words unkindly said. 
It may be years that we are doom’d to sever; 
But can it be that love shall wane? 
Ah! no, the heart once loving loves forever; 
I know that he will call me back again. 

3. I dreamt last night a charming little starling 
Came softly tapping at my window blind, 
And in its bill a letter from my darling, 
Which said that he’d recall those words unkind. 
Oh, can it be from love he has released me. 
And that my love has been in vain! 
Oh, may my darling send me one in earnest— 
Take back those words, and call me back again.
