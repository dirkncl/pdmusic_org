1. My Grandfather’s cane, golden headed and strong,
Is hung by the chimney today,
It’s never been used since those days long ago,
When Grandfather, there passed away,
’Twas bought by our sire, for the dear one of old,
A great many seasons ago,
And helped him in need, as he wandered about,
With footsteps so feeble and slow. 

CHORUS
For years it has hung by the chimney with care,
And Grandfather’s hands placed it there, (placed it there)
And hearts that have sorrow’d for Grandfather long,
Will guard it with tenderest care.

2. With cane in his hand he would wander about,
His step growing feebler each day
And never a frown, did my Grandfather wear
Though his hair was sprinkled with gray;
It helped him in sunshine and helped him in shade,
A staff for the noble and true,
Whose face wore the miles we would love to recall
Ere Grandfather bade us adieu.

3. The lessons of life it is teaching us too,
When charms of old age we recall;
And as a memento, we’ll cherish it long,
Dear Grandfather’s gift to us all;
It hangs by the chimney, so aged and worn,
But Grandfather’s hand placed it there
And hearts that have sorrow’d for Grandfather long
Will guard it with tenderest care.
