Do you remember it darling I wonder?
Do you remember it, so long ago?
All that we said as we stroll'd there together,
Out on the rocks as the tide was low?
What did I say, as we stroll'd on together?
What did you answer me timid and low?
What did you promise me?
Do you remember it?
Out on the rocks when the tide was low,
Our on the rocks when the tide was low/
Never remember it, never remember it,
I have forgiven it, long long ago;
Only I think of it, only I think of it,
Out on the rocks when the tide was low,
Our on the rocks when the tide was low.
When the tide is low.
When the tide is low.
