1. Now I read de other day George Washington did say
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
An’ I thought it very queer dat a man we loved so dear,
  Would “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
But times have changed since den an’ likewise have de men,
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
De darkies now am free an’ I would like to see;
  Who’d “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”

CHORUS [played twice after VERSEs 1-3 only]
Den don’t you worry,
  Children don’t worry,
Darkies don’t worry,
  Dey’ll trust you with a gun.

2. Now one thing I would advise if de anarchists should rise
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
If dey try Chicago here it will cost dem very dear,
  So “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
You bet you’ll hear dem yell as we daries give ’em— well,
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
We”ll finish up de story by sending ’em to glory,
  So “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”

3. Now de black man he can fight as well as any white
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
An’ history will show how brave he faced de foe,
  Oh! “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
Now when de war broke out did any body shout,
  “Never trust a nigger with a gun.”
Dey sent him to de front an’ made him stand de brunt,
  You “bet dey’ll trust a nigger with a gun.”

[CODA without CHORUS]
4. For aint you seen de colored troops when dey were on parade,
Wid heads erect for line an’ step de whites are in de shade,
For dey’re no only drilled for show dey fight an’ never run,
De people learned dis much I know to trust ’em with a gun.
