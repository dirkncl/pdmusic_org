1.
If you want to get in dem golden gates, 
  Ring dem heav'n-ly bells, 
Come along, brothers, and don't be late, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells; 
De gates am gold an' de hinges, too, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells, 
Dar's plenty of room for me and you, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Gwine to ringer dem heav'nly bells, 
Gwine to ringer dem heav'nly bells, 
Gwine to ringer dem heav'nly bells, good Lord, 
To call dem sinners home.

2.
When de whale was floating down de stream, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells, 
He swal-lowed up Jonah and didn't he scream, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells; 
Jonah was all dat he had on hand, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells, 
So he cast him ober on dry land, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells.

3.
I will tell you now as I've told you before, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells, 
I'll sing  this verse and I'll sing no more, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells; 
Why, de music lies on Russell's shelf, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells, 
And if you want any more sing it yourself, 
  Ring dem heav'nly bells.
