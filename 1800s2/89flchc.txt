"Four Little Curly Headed Coons" (1889)
The Famous End Song and Chorus.
As played by P. S. Gilmore's famous Band.
Words and Music by James W. Wheeler

1.
There lived in a town with a great long name,
Four little curly headed coons;
And they talked of wealth and they talked of fame,
These four little curly headed coons.
They sit all day, and tink, tink, tink,
with mischief in their eye;
And look at you and blink, blink, blink,
These four little coons so sly.

CHORUS 2 times
Four little curly headed coons,
four little curly headed coons,
They'd perch upon a box, as cunning as a fox,
These four little curly headed coons.

2.
I'se born for a lawyer the first coon said,
"What!" says the other little coons;
An' I spec dem fees gwine ter kill ye dead,
"Mighty right" says the other little coons.
You'll walk into my parlor, like de spider tole dat fly;
I'll talk wif yo till you're dead broke,
Den larf till I almost die.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
I'se gwine for a job in de pulpit, sho'
"Rats!" says the other little coons;
If ye skuff dem feet, den I trow yer out de do,
"Held yer bref," says the other little coons.
When dat collection box goes roun',
I'll tend dat snap mysef;
Now yo des trus dis chile fer dat,
Doan fret 'bout de holdin of de bref.

(CHORUS 3 times)

4.
Now when ye get sick yo can send fer me,
I'm des de curly headed coon;
In a doctor's shop I'm a gwine fer ter be,
"Bress de lam'" cried the other little coons.
You tink dis chile talk like a goose,
but you doan know dis coon;
I'll dose yo so on lixer juice,
You'll feel like de chillun in de moon.

(CHORUS 2 times)

5.
I spec I must open a bank for you,
"Lord!" said the frightened little coons;
And yo' fotch dat cash till I tink 'twill do,
"Hyar him talk" says the other little coons.
I'll imitate de white cashier,
or some good pious crank;
And when dat coast am mighty clear,
I'll scoot wif de money in de bank.

CHORUS 2 times
Four little curly headed coons,
four little curly headed loons,
Their little hearts were broke,
they'd like to take and choke,
This smart little curly headed coon.
