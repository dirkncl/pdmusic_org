1.
[Solo]
The time has come, I must go,
I must play on the old banjo;
Walk, dad Lew, Oh, Mister Lew!
Ehe! ehe! he! [Chorus] here me now. 
[Solo] The time has come,
I do declare;
I want a lock of my gal's hair;
Walk, dad Lew,
Oh, Mister, Lew!
Ehe, ehe! he!
[Chorus] hear me now.

CHORUS: 1st time Solo, 2nd Chorus
I'm going a way to leave you.
  Good bye, good bye;
I'm going a way to leave you.
  Good bye, Liza Jane.
I'm going a way to leave you.
  I'm going down to Lynchburg town;
If you get there before I do,
It's good bye, Liza Jane.

2.
[Solo]
Behind the hen-house, on my knees,
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze;
Walk, dad, Lew, Oh, Mister Lew!
Ehe, ehe! he! [Chorus] hear me now.
[Solo] Twas nothing but a Rooster saying his pray'rs
And giving out a hymn, such a getting up stairs;
Walk, dad Lew,
Oh, Mister Lew!
Ehe! ehe! he!
[Chorus] hear me now.

(CHORUS: 1st time Solo, 2nd Chorus)

3.
[Solo]
Chickens and hens have gone to roost,
A hawk flew down and bit an old goose;
Walk, dad Lew, Oh, Mister Lew!
Ehe! ehe! he! [Chorus] hear me now.
[Solo] Bit a young duck in the middle of the back,
Made the old drake go quack, quack, quack;
Walk, dad, Lew,
Oh, Mister Lew!
Ehe! ehe! he!
[Chorus] hear me now.

(CHORUS: 1st time Solo, 2nd Chorus)
