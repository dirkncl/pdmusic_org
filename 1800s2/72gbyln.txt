1. Grandpa, bless me once again,
Before I go to sleep,
And as in pray’r you raise your hands,
Ask Him my soul to keep,
Ask Him to guide my steps aright,
Along life’s barren shore,
That I may meet in realms of light,
The lov’d ones gone before.
Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
Before I lay me down to sleep,
Oh Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
Bless your little Nell.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
(Your little Nell,)
Before I lay me down to sleep,
(me down to sleep,)
Oh Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
(your little Nell,)
Dear Grandpa, bless you little Nell,
your little Nell.


2. Grandpa, bless me once again,
And let me with you pray,
To Him who guards our sleep by night,
Our footsteps thro’ the day,
Ask Him to leave you ever here,
With her you love so well,
And never take you Grandpa dear,
Away from little Nell.
Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
Before I lay me down to sleep,
Oh Grandpa, bless your little Nell,
Bless your little Nell.
