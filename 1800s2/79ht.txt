1. Lone and weary throc’ the streets we wander,
For we have no place to lay our heads,
Not a friend on earth is left to shelter us,
For both our parents now are dead.
Poor mother died when we were both young,
Yet father made for us a home,
But now he’s killed by falling timbers,
And we are left here all alone.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Lone and weary thro’ the streets we wander,
For we have no place to lay our heads;
Not a friend on earth is let to shelter us,
For both our parents now are dead.

2. Who will pity us, and who will give us shelter
Thro’ this sad and lonely night?
Little brother now is cold and hungry,
And the tears roll down his cheeks so white.
Oh, if our mother now was left us,
Then she would care for us tonight,
But ah! the angels they have borne her
Unto a home where all is bright.

3. Come, good angels, take us to that bright world,
Where our parents now have gone to dwell,
Where the cruel flames will never reach us,
And the orphan has no woes to tell.
For oh, our mother oft did tell us,
When she was with us here on earth,
That God would wipe away all sorrows
That did not have in sin their birth.
