1. Say one little pray’r for mother,
In the distant by and by,
Though my face you see but faintly,
Through the mist of memry’s sky;
Happiest hours of joy and gladness,
I have ever wish’d for you,
And let not sorrow, pain or sadness,
Weaken love that’s now so true.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Say one little pray’r for mother,
Mingle with its thoughts of love
I will watch you and will bless you,
From my happy home above.

2. Say one little pray’r for mother,
One I’ve taught in childhood’s days,
When your loving lips were eager,
For to learn the words of praise;
Treasure well this simple flower,
And in future days of joy,
Ah! kneel and pray for her who gave it,
Do my dear and darling boy.

3. Say one little pray’r for mother,
For my days on earth are few,
All the rest have gone to heaven,
None are left to love but you;
Let your dreams be of a meeting,
In that happy time to be,
And leep unto your promise faithful,
Don’t forget to pray for me.
