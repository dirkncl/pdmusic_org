The Latest Craze.
"Little Annie Rooney" (1890)
Song and Chorus.
Written, Composed and Sung by Michael Nolan.

1.
A winning way, a pleasant smile,
Dress'd so neat but quite in style,
Merry chaff your time to wile,
Has little Annie Rooney.
Ev'ry eve-ning, rain or shine,
I make a call twixt eight and nine,
On her who shortly will be mine,
Little Annie Rooney.

CHORUS 'p'
She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau;
She's my Annie, I'm her Joe,
Soon we'll marry, never to part,
Litle Annie Rooney is my sweetheart!

(CHORUS 'ff')

2.
The parlor's small, but neat and clean,
And set with taste so seldom seen,
And you can bet, the household queen,
Is little Annie Rooney.
The fire burns cheerfully and bright,
As a family circle round each night,
We form, and ev'ry one's delight
Is little Annie Rooney.

(CHORUS 'p')
(CHORUS 'ff')

3.
We've been engaged close on a year,
The happy time is drawing near,
I'll wed the one I love so dear,
Little Annie Rooney.
My friends declare I'm in a jest,
Until the time comes will not rest,
But one who knows its value best,
Is little Annie Rooney.

(CHORUS 'p')
(CHORUS 'ff')
