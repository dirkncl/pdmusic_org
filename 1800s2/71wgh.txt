1. Our weary days will soon be over, 
And every night of gloom 
Be lost in that delightful waking 
Of bliss, beyond the tomb; 
Around our frail and shattered bark, 
When ocean billow foam, 
The soul amid the storm can sing, 
Praise God, we’re going home!

2. The heart that finds repose in Jesus, 
Can smile at every pain, 
“To live in Christ,” in joy or sorrow,— 
“To die, immortal gain;” 
We look beyond these fading scenes, 
Tho’ strangers here we roam; 
We have a sure abiding place,— 
Praise God, we’re going home!

3. The hand of death may rend asunder 
Our dearest earthly ties; 
Yet faith unveils a world of glory, 
And there we long to rise; 
Faith soars aloft on eagle wings, 
Above yon azure dome, 
Brings heavenly visions to our sight,— 
Praise God, we’re going home!
