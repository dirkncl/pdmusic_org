The children sleep; ’tis noon of night,
The stars on high give silv’ry light;
A mother sits ’twixt hope and fear,
Watching her babes— is succor near?
Her toilworn hands are clasp’d in pray’r;
Naught for the matin meal is there;
O Father! “give their daily bread!”
She weeping prays beside their lowly bed.

The children sleep, and smile in dream,
The stars still more intensly gleam;
The mother’s consciousness is gone,
Exhausted nature claims its own;
Bright visions now glide thro’ the room,
Dispelling shade, dispelling gloom;
O saintly mother! cease to fear,
Be strong in faith! be strong in faith! angels are near.
