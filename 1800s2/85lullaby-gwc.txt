[CHORUS]
Lullaby baby, 
Lullaby baby must sleep.

VERSE 1a
Now when the daylight dies 
Closed be the litlte eyes.
Rest till the sun arise.
Sleep, baby, sleep.
Peaceful shall rest thy head, 
Noiseless shall be the tread 
Round our dear darling’s bed.

[CHORUS 1a]
Lullaby baby, 
Lullaby baby must sleep, 
Sleep, baby, sleep.

[VERSE 1b]
Peaceful shall rest they head, 
Noiseless shall be the tread 
Round our dear darling’s bed.

[CHORUS 1b]
Lullaby baby, 
Lullaby baby must sleep, must sleep.

[VERSE 2a]
No cause for anxious fears, 
Not yet for thee the years 
When life must have its tears.

[CHORUS 2a]
Lullaby baby, 
Lullaby baby must sleep, 
Sleep, baby, sleep.

{VERSE 2b]
Sleep, baby sleep.
Forms that we can not see, 
Loving are watching thee 
Thus may it ever be.

[CHORUS 2b]
Sleep.baby sleep.
Forms that we can not see, 
Loving are watching thee 
Thus may it ever be.

[CODA CHORUS]
Lullaby baby, Lullaby baby, 
Lull-la-a-by.
