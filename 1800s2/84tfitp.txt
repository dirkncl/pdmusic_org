1. While strolling in the park one day
All in the merry month of May
A roguish pair of eyes, they took me by surprise
In a moment my poor heart she stole away!

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, a sunny smile was all she gave to me
And of course we were as happy as can be
So neeatly I raise my hat
And made a polite remark
I never shall forget that lovely afternoon,
When I met her at the fountain in the park.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
So neatly I raise my hat And maide a polite re mark.
I never shall forget that lovely afternoon,
When I met her at the fountain in the park.

2. We linger’d there beneath the trees.
Her voice was like the fragrant breeze.
We talked of happy love until the stars above
When  her loving “yes” she gave my heart to please
