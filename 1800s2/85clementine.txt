1. In the centre of a golden valley
Dwelt a maiden all divine
A pretty creature a miner’s daughter
And her name was Clementine,
Her noble father was the forman
Of ev’ry valued mine,
And ev’ry miner and ranchman
Was a brother to Clementine.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh my darling, oh my darling,
My darling Clementine,
You are lost for me for ever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.

2. The forman miner, an old forty niner
In dreams and thoughts sublime
Lived in comfort with his daughter
His pretty child Clementine
When far away he would often pray
That in his sunny clime
No harm might overtake her
His favorite nugget Clementine.

3. When the day was done and the setting sun
Its rays they ceased to shine.
Homeward came the brawney miner
To caress his Clementine.
None was nearer, none was dearer
Since the days of fortynine
When in youth he had another
Who was then his Clementine.

4. She led her ducks down to the river.
The weather it was fine.
Stubbed her toe against a sliver
Fell into the rageing brine.
He heard her calling, calling father.
Her voice was like a chime
But alas he was no swimmer
So he lost his Clementine.
