1. Whilst thinking of Thanksgiving day, 
One night as on my couch I lay, 
I dreamt of things for which we may 
Indeed be very thankful. 
Our Institutions great and grand, 
Command respect on ev’ry hand, 
And foreigners from ev’ry strand, 
Acknowledge this a “Happy Land.” 
But in my dreams I seem’d tosee, 
Countless blessings, for which we, 
I think you’ll one and all agree, 
Should feel extremely thankful.

2. I dreamt of Darwin’s theory, how 
A monkey to a man may grow, 
So I went to Barnum’s monkey show, 
Was convinced and truly thankful. 
I saw their gestures all correct 
And if Darwin with his intelect, 
Relation claims, I don’t object, 
Such fellow feeling all respect. 
But for myself I must decline 
The honor of the monkey line, 
They’re Darwin’s relatives not mine, 
I hope they’re very thankful.

3. I dreamt that General Grant one night,
Had got his third cigar alight,
And he puff’d away with all his might,
And yet he was not thankful.
I’ve been in office now he said,
Two long terms I would ’twere three,
In fact I don’t object to be,
In office all my life you see.
But Uncle Sam begins to find,
Another ticket to his mind,
So Grant with pockets now well lined,
Must be content and thankful. 

4. I dreamt the “Tidal wave” had past,
Our prospect now was not o’ercast,
Of tricks and jobs we had seen the last,
And we were more than thankful.
I dreamt America still stood
Above all nations great and good,
Her sons were brave be’t understood,
And the Union discord had withstood.
My dream was o’er and now I pause,
And if you’re generous in my cause,
I hope you’ll give me your applause,
And make me truly thankful.
