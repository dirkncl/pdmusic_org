1. Like mated doves in concert found,
  When spring makes green the heather,
From early years our hearts were bound,
  In foest ties together;
We thought not of the future then,
  What ills that bond might sever,
And so we vowed, and vowed again,
  Our love should last,
Our love should last,
  Our love should last for ever.

2. And sunshine on our hearts was shed,
  Beneath a Nation’s blessing;
Love’s tender branches round us spread,
  Caressed and all caressing,
As banded souls harmonious move,
  So each combined endeavour,
In Heaven’s own light appeared to prove,
  Our love would last,
Our love would last,
  Our love would last for ever.

3. What time thus pass’d ’twere vain to tell,
  In winter’s stormy weather,
Death bade us take a sad farewell,
  Though long we lov’d together;
If  here his form I ne’er behold,
  His voice respond to never,
Affection still retains its hold,
  Our love shall last,
Our love shall last,
  Our love shall last for ever.
