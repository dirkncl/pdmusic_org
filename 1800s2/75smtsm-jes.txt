1. Sing me to sleep, mother, sing me to sleep;
Shadows are falling, and round me now creep;
Sing me the songs that I love once again,
And let your voice, mother, banish all pain;
And on my pale lips your sweet kisses press,
Then my sad heart will know no distress.
Far among strangers, sadhearted I weep,
Calling for mother to sing me to sleep;
Weary of life, all alone I would weep,
Praying for mother to sing me to sleep.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Far from your kisses and loving embrace,
Never to see your dear loving face;
Far among strangers, sadhearted I weep,
Praying for mother to sing me to sleep.

2. Sing me to sleep, mother, sing me to rest;
To hear your sweet voice, mother, is to be blest;
Never again from your side shall I stray,
Here to remain with you ever, I’ll pray;
Yes, lay my head once again on thy breast;
Forsaken by all— but here there is rest.
Close by your heart, mother dear, let me creep,
While you are singing me gently to sleep;
Dark grows the shadows oh! pray do not weep,
Angels are singing the wand’rer to sleep.
