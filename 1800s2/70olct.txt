1. He murmur’d low each gentle word, 
Down in yon summer, summer dale! 
The vows he breathed I blushed to hear, 
It was the old, it was the old, old tale. 
The tender story touch’d my heart 
With passion’s tender spell! 
The tender story touch’d my heart 
With passion’s tender spell 
And yet, and yet sad fears will start, 
And yet, and yet sad fears will start 
Which only love can tell, 
Which only love can tell, 
Which only only love can tell. 

2. Ah! me, that fear should ever shrowd, 
Life’s first and fairest, fairest dream! 
That doubt should rise, and cast a cloud, 
On youth’ bright summer, youth’s bright summer stream! 
O I believe the tale he told. 
I know he loves me well! 
O I believe the tale he told. 
I know he loves me well! 
And yet, and yet sad fears will start, 
And yet, and yet sad fears will start 
Which only love can tell, 
Which only love can tell, 
Which only only love can tell.
