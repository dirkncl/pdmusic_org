1. Do you think that the world will soon end, sir,
  Do you think the Millennium is near,
When justice is bought with a price, sir,
  By whiskey and strong lager beer,
When our laws are enacted for gain, sir,
  And the people are robbed by a tax,
When the lawyers will take all you’ve got, sir,
  By the laws which they call stubborn facts,
    When the lawyers will take all you’ve got, sir,
      By the laws which they call stubborn facts?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
No, no, no, no, no, no,
The world will not come to an end,
The world will not come to an end,
The world will not come to an end,
’Till poor man from sin is free.
Then the lamb and lion together will play,
For the devil’s end is near,
And all the world will sing with joy
The Millennium will appear.

2. Do you think that the world will soon end sir,
  Do you think the Millennium is near,
When houses and banks must have locks, sir,
  With the strongest of doors in the rear,
When our preashers will PREACH for to please, sir,
  And the people will make the wrong right,
When our churches are places of show sir,
  And the Lord’s poor are shut out of sight,
    When our churches are places of show sir,
      And the Lord’s poor are shut out of sight?

3. Do you think that the world will soon end sir,
  Do you think the Millennium is near,
When fruit is so fair just in sight sir,
  But rotten as you go to the rear,
When you buy and don’t get what you’ve bought sir,
  From a pin to a grand house and lot,
When there’s cheat in all things that you touch sir,
  And the truth seems indeed quite forgot,
    When there’s cheat in all things that you touch sir,
      And the truth seems indeed quite forgot?
