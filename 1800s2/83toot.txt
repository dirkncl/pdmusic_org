1. Youth’s happy days are over! 
Under green mounds laid low; 
Sleep forms of many a rover! 
Who rambled these shades long ago! 
Their absence leaves one here a lone! 
Like flowers they die, one by one! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Companions, friends of childhood, 
Around “This old oak tree!” 
Friends, companions, 
Around “This old oak tree,” 
“This old oak tree,” “This old oak tree,” 
Around “This old oak tree.”

 2. The wildwood flow’rs  are blooming; 
Summer has come back again, 
The warblers songs are renew ing, 
In sweet, sweet and joyous refrain. 
The years  recalling of boyhood, 
Roaming these woodlands free.
