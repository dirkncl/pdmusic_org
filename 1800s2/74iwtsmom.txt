Everybody in the United States, and in fact the citizens of
the Old World, have read of the heartless abduction of 
Charlie Brewster Ross, four years of age, who was stolen from
his parents door, July 1. The villains who stole the dear
child submitted overtures, offering to restore him on the pay-
ment of twenty thousand dollars ransom. The bereavement of the
grieving parents, and the sympathetic response of the whole
people, suggested the words and the music of
“I WANT TO SEE MAMA ONCE MORE.”

1. 
Two weary eyes that sadly weep; 
Two little hands uprais’d in prayer; 
While dark and lone the moments creep, 
Unlighted by a mother’s care. 
Oh, sweet the gentle tones that fall, 
The wistful eyes of heav’n implore! 
Again we hear that pleading call: 
“I want to see mama once more.”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, darling one, to loving arms 
May heav’n again thy form restore! 
Sweet be the answer to thy call: 
“I want to see mama once more.”

2. 
The nightwind echoes back alone 
That weary, sad and lonely cry; 
And empty arms clasp not their own 
Beneath the dark and cheerless sky.
Oh, mother, while in tears you bow, 
Sad, drooping eyes, that heav’n implore! 
Thy darling one is pleading now: 
“I want to see mama once more.”
