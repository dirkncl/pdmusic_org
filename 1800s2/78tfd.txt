1. Why art thou wand’ring alone on the shore?
The wind it blows cold and the white breakers roar;
Oh, I am wand’ring alone by the sea, 
To watch if my father’s returning to me, 
To watch if my father’s returning to me;

For the gale it blew hard thro’ the darkness of night.
And I’m watching hers since the dawning of light, 
Looking thro’ tears o’er the dark rolling sea, 
To watch if my father’s returning to me, 
To watch if my father’s returning to me.

2. Last night  when my father put forth on the deep, 
To our cottage  returning I lay down to sleep, 
But while the calm of sweet sleep came to me, 
The voice of the tempest was waking the sea, 
The voice of the tempest was waking the sea.

I thought in a dream ’twas my father that spoke, 
But oh! to the voice of the tempest I woke, 
And the father I dreamt of was far o’re the sea, 
Ah! why in my dream call’d my father to me?
Ah! why in my dream call’d my waking the sea? 

3. Vain ly I look thro’ the fast driving gale, 
Hopeless I see what hope fancies a sail, 
But ’tis only the wing of the seagull flits by, 
And my heart it sinks low at the bird’s wailting cry, 
My heart it sinks low at the bird’s wailing cry;

For the storm must blow hard when the gull comes on shore, 
Oh! that the fisherman’s gift were no more 
Than the gift of the wild bird to soar o’r the sea— 
Good Angels, thy wings bear my father to me, 
Good Angels, thy wings bear my father to me.
