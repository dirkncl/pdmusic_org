1. 
When a child I liv’d at Lincoln with my parents at the farm,
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a charm;
She would often take me on her knee, when tir’d of childish play,
And as she press’d me to her breast, I’ve heard my mother say: 

CHORUS
Waste not, want not, is a maxim I would teach,
Let your watchword be, despatch, and practise what you preach,
Do no let your chances like sunbeams pass you by,
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

2. 
As years roll’d on I grew to be a mischief making boy!
Destruction seem’d my only sport, it was my only joy;
And well do I remember, when ofttimes well chastis’d,
How father sat beside me then, and thus has me advis’d:

3. 
When I arriv’d at manhood, I embark’d in public life,
And found it was a rugged road bestrewn with care and strife;
I speculated foolishly, my losses were severe;
But still a tiny little voice kept whisp’ring in my ear,

4. 
Then I studies strict economy, and found to my surprise,
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise;
I grasp’d each chance and always “struck the iron while ’twas hot,”
I seiz’d my opportunities, and never once forgot,

5. 
I’m married now and happy, I’ve a careful little wife,
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife,
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three;
The lesson that I teach them as they prattle round my knee,
