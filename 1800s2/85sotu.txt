1. Lord of hosts, thou God of nations,
Hear us while we pray to thee;
One in heart whate’re our stations,
Let it sound o’er land and sea,
Shield from harm our native land,
Guard her from the tyrant’s hand,

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
With our people brave and free,
Our flag shall wave o’er ev’ry sea.

2. Land so blest, with vales and mountains,
Prairies blooming with the rose;
Forests wild, with gushing fountains,
Glassy lakes in sweet repose,
May no foe her beauty mar,
God Himself her guiding star,

3. Home of homes, our fathers founded,
Sacred land to freedom dear;
Gem of gems, with gifts unbounded,
Freeman’s joy, and despot’s fear,
Land for which our fathers bled,
Blessings e’er be o’er her shed,

4. May her sons, with sacred feeling,
Guard her soil with watchful care;
While the thrones of kings are reeling,
Thus to God we’ll raise our pray’r,
Shield, O Lord, our native land,
Ever may she firmly stand,
