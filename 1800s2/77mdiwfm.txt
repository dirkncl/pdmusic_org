1. The moon’s shining bright,
  And the stars give their light,
The evening invites us to stray;
  But in vain do I talk of a bright moonlight walk,
I’m here and I can’t get away,
  I’m a bird in a cage,
And they say “at my age
  That their wonder is what I can see,
In a walk in the cold,”
  Tho’ the truth must be told,
My darling is waiting for me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
My darling is waiting for me,
  Close down by the old willow tree,
And before they’re aware
  I’ll steal down the back stair,
To where he is waiting for me.

2. They ask me to sing,
  And my music they bring,
’Tis “Meet me by Moonlight” again;
  And ’tis getting quite late,
And I know he won’t wait,
  But go if it comes on to rain.
And now they propose
  All the shutters to close,
And a form in the moonlight I see
  But before they’re aware,
I’ll steal down the back stair
  To where he is waiting for me.

3. Oh! why don’t they go
  And not bother me so!
I’m longing to fly to his arms,
  I am deaf and I’m blind
To the many so kind
  For I’m dreaming of somebody’s charms.
I’ll complain of my head
  And will leave for my bed,
And while sorrow is passing around
  I’ll steal down the back stair
In the fresh autumn air
  Where darling is sure to be found.
