1. Oh! birdie, I am tired now, 
I do not care to hear you sing; 
You’ve sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head beneath your wing; 
I’m sleepy too as I can be, 
And sister, when my pray’r is said, 
I want to lay me down to rest, 
So put me in my little bed.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come, sister, come, 
Kiss me good night, 
For I my evening pray’r have said; 
I’m tired now and sleepy too, 
Come, put me in my little bed.

2. Oh! sister, what did mother say, 
When she was call’d to Heav’n away? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray; 
I can’t forget the day she died, 
She placed her hand upon my head, 
She whisper’d softly, “keep my child,” 
And then they told me she was dead.

3. Dear sister, come and hear my pray’r, 
Now ere I lay me down to sleep, 
Within my Heav’nly Father’s care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep; 
And let me ask of Him above, 
To keep my soul in paths of Right, 
Oh! let me thank Him for His love, 
Ere I shall say my last “good night.”
