1. Come, brothers, wake to glory!
Know ye not the hour is near;
Hear afar the signal sounding,—
A warning for us all to appear.

[REFRAIN]
Pray for your people,
Pray to your God,
Pray for redemption
Promis’d in His Word.

DUET
Oh come, why will you sleep;
For the hour is approaching near,
Of the time when we all
Music account for our doings here:
Come, repent now your sins:
Already the time is at hand,
And the voice of the Saviour
Is calling you to join his happy band.
  And the voice of the Saviour
  Is calling you to join his happy band.

2. Wake now the song of glory!
Glory in your Saviour’s name;
Singing forth His praise forever,—
To save a sinful world, He came.
