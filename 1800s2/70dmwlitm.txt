1. When twilight shaded the beautiful vale,
And the Whippoorwill sings in the trees;
I stray by the banks of the murmuring stream,
Where the tall willows sigh in the breeze,
’Tis there a fairy in gladness awaits;
As the silver moon peeps o’er the hill,
My heart beats with joy when ever I meet,
Dear Minnie who lives in the Mill;
My heart beats with joy when ever I meet,
Dear Minnie who lives in the Mill.

2. How oft I have told her how dear she’s to me,
As I press’d her sweet form to my heart;
I gaz’d in her eyes beaming bright with true love,
In this wide world we never will part,
There may be some fairer who’d love me as well;
But my heart in its gladness will thrill,
But dearer than all is that dear little girl,
My Minnie who lives in the Mill;
But dearer than all is that dear little girl,
My Minnie who lives in the Mill.
