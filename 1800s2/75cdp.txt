1.
De possum meat am good to eat,
  Carve him to de heart;
Yo'll always find him good and sweet,
  Carve him to de heart;
My dog did bark, and I went to see,
  Carve him to de heart;
And dar was a possum up de tree,
  Carve him to de heart.

CHORUS [after each Verse]
Carve dat possum, carve dat possum, children,
  Carve dat possum, carve him to de heart;
Oh, carve dat possum, carve dat possum, children,
  Carve dat possum, carve him to de heart.

2.
I reached up for to pull him in,
  Carve him to de heart;
De possum has began to grin,
  Carve him to de heart;
I served him home and dressed him off,
  Carve him to de heart;
I hung him up in de frost,
  Carve him to de heart.

3.
De way to cook de possum sound,
  Carve him to de heart;
Frist parbile him, den bake him brown,
  Carve him to de heart;
Lay sweet potatoes in de pen,
  Carve him to de heart;
De sweetest eatin' in de lan',
  Carve him to de heart.
