1. How sweetly on this wintry air,
A chorus loud and clear,
Rings out the merry Christmas time,
The brightest of the year.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Good news, come one and all,
Take up the joyful lay,
And shout with grateful happy hearts,
Our Lord was born today.

2. He laid his crown of glory by,
He left His throne of light,
And wond’ring angels sang His birth,
Among the stars of night.

3. O glory, glory, peace on earth,
Good will to man is given,
The hand of mercy opens wide,
The pearly gates of heaven.

4. O while we think of blessings past,
And all His love recall,
We’ll crown Him Prophet, Priest, and King,
Redeemer, Lord of all.
