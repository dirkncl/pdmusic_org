1. Nobody knows when we’er out upon a spree, 
Nobody knows nor cares a D. 
Nobody knows for its underneath the rose, 
So nobody knows but Eliza!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Razzle, dazzle, Razzle, dazzle, 
How full I am Don’t care a hang 
Razzle, dazzle, de dazzle, 
Let’t have one drink more! 
We’ve out upon a terrible fare, 
No matter how full we nev er will care, 
For Razzle, dazzle de dazzle 
Let’s have one drink more!


2. When morning comes and our little spree is o’er, 
Ev’ry one resolves to drink no more, 
For R. E. morse has us very strong and sure, 
So we’ll all swear off together!
