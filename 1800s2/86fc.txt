I know a shore,
Where the wave evermore, 
chanteth the hymn of the brave and the free;
Where ev’ry mighty river
Beareth in forever
The gems of many a land and many a sea.
The king of day, with his earliest ray
Brightens the home of the fair and the free,
And gilds the Palace White,
With its starry flag bedight,
The banner of right
And the banner of might,
That rules over land and sea.
Forward, Columbia!
Thy place is in the van.
Forward, Columbia!
To lead the race of man.
Advance thy front
In peace and war!
A broad, fair domain is thine, my country,
Govern it in noble faith and truth, 
Oh show hoary Europe what ’tis to be free,
Free as the just and true are free!
Forward, Columbia!
Thy place is in the van!
Forward, Columbia!
To lead the race of man!
When the foe gathers near
And the cannon’s roar we hear,
Liberty! then protect thine own hallow’d soil!
Hark! I hear loud and clear
The gay trumpet call of our gallant host.
Hurrah, they cry
We’ll win or die,
Ever worthy our country’s boast!
Ever, ever, in peace and war
Be thy name, Columbia, heard afar!
Ever, ever, in peace and war,
Columbia, be thy name heard afar 
in peace or our war be thy name heard afar
Columbia fair, 
In thy balmy air
All beauty, valor and wealth ever shine;
Bright land of the brave,
In the far distant wave,
What glory,
What glory,
What joy can ever vie with thine.
Hail, Columbia!
