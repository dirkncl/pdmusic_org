1. Friendless and sad I am dreaming,
  Weeping o’er bliss that has flown;
Craving a heartfelt devotion,
  Sighing for Mother and home.
Many were tender and holy,
  Joys were pervading the air,
And sweet love was the theme of my ballad,
  Love was the light of my prayer.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh! for days of yore,
Mother, love and home;
Friendless and sad I am dreaming,
Dreaming in sorrow alone.

2. Queen of the Graces they called me,
  Lovers were pleading to woo;
Then came the choice of an idol,
  One that I thought would be true.
Old as the world is my story,
  Leaving a heaven of light,
How I’ve suffer’d in shame and desertion,
  Feeling my life is a blight.

3. Grief is my only companion,
  Pleasure is now of the past;
Shadows are looming before me,
  Shadows, I fear that will last.
They who would smile are now frowning,
  Pointing the finger of scorn;
How I used to think earth was a heaven,
  Now, I say, why was I born?
