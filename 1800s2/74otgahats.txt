1.
White little hands are clasp’d in delight,
Dear roguish eyes are merry and bright;
Over the fields the daisies are fair,
Sunlight and joy are gilding the air;
Glad little [?], what is it you play?
What is your sport this beautiful day?
Wee, rosebud lips, how sweet their reply:
“Open the gates as high as the sky.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Bright is the land that [?]eth afar,
Childhood’s fair land as pure as a star;
All that we love may gaily pass by,
“Open the gates as high as the sky.”

2.
Songs of the birds they heed no awhile,
Brooklets may sing, and lilies may smile;
Fondly they play in innocent glee,
Bright as the flow’rs, and gay as the bee;
Earth has no night so blest and so dear;
Hark to their laugh, so birdlike and clear!
Sorrow they’ve none, and [?] they defy;
“Open the gates as high as the sky.”

3.
Dear little hearts, I watch you with joy!
Never may grief your gladness destroy!
Over the hill, and over the dale,
Roam with the brook, and laugh with the gale;
Still do I dream of those that are gone,
Still is my heart all weary and lone;
White little hands, e’en now, while I sigh:
“Open the gates as high as the sky.”
