1. Do you think of me, darling, I murmur, 
When night falls on valley and hill, 
When out of the sky day has faded, 
And the nightbird her vesper song trills;
Do you think of our last tender parting, 
And the sorrow that clouded my brow?
Ah! say, for the teardrops are starting, 
Lurline, do you think of me now?

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Lurline, dear Lurline, while the twinkling stars shine o’er the sea, 
Oh! tell me, Lurline, are you waiting and watching for me?

2. There’s mamy a change since we parted, 
The years with their burden of care 
Have left me no longer light-hearted, 
And silvery now is my hair;
But I have been true to thee ever, 
And do you remember the vow 
We pledg’d to be constant forever, 
Lurline, do you think of me now?

3. Tonight I am eagerly waiting 
The hour that shall bear me to thee, 
To hear the sweet words that will welcome 
The wanderer back from the sea;
Thy smiles which are bright as the sunbeams, 
Will banish the clouds from my brow;
Ah! earth seems an Eden of gladness, 
Lurline, as I think of you now.
