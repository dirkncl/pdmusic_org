1. Attention please while I relate to you,
Of how I met my love,
’Twas in a lane as I was walking thro’,
The moon shone bright above,
A lovely maiden all alone,
Was walking leisurely,
When I made bold to ask this little one
If she would walk with me.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
Sally Mackenally,
That is my darling’s name;
And she lives up in our alley,
With her sister Susan Jane.
Yes! ’deed I do, I love Miss Sally.
Umph! lots of fun up in our alley.
Oh, yes she is the sweetest little girl,
That ever you did see,
Her eyes are bright,
Her teeth are like the pearl,
That’s found down in the sea.

2. I took my darling to a fancy ball,
And danced all night and day,
And Sal she was the gayest of them all,
And I was just as gay,
The music played then I cut loose
The darkies all did bawl,
They laughed and shouted, give that nigger room,
And they near broke down the hall.
