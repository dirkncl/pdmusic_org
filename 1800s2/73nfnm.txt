1. No father, no mother, and no where to go,
I’m left a poor orphan, a burden of woe;
From morn until night I am roaming the street,
But dare not appeal to the strangers I meet;
The nicely dress’d ladies all pass in their pride,
And shring from my garments when I’m by their side,
The gentlemen jostle and knock me about,
And stylish young Misses trip by with a pout.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
No father, no mother, and no where to go,
I’m left a poor orphan, a burden of woe;
From morn until night I am walking the street,
And dare not appeal to the strangers I meet.

2. No father, no mother, and nothing to wear,
I am a sad picture, an object of care,
While day after day I go hungry and sore,
But will not appear at the wealthy one’s door;
The servants are chilly and look with a frown,
They tell me there’s plenty of work in the town,
The landlady orders me back to the street,
And this is the pity they throw at my feet.

3. No father, no mother, no shelter for me,
I am a poor outcast, oh, why should it be?
From dawn until dark I am tramping in vain,
But none will adhere to my anguish and pain;
The people are heartless and charity’s blind,
But there is an Eden I hope soon to find,
The needy are welcome, the weary find rest,
Oh, may I soon enter that home of the blest.
