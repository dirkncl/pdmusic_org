1. Leave me not in anger, darling. 
Smile again before we part. 
Keep the flow’rs of love still blooming. 
In the garden of your heart; 
Life without you would be lone ly, 
Days and years would dreary be. 
For I love you, and you only  
Can bring happiness to me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Leave me not in anger, darling, 
Smile again before we part, 
Keep the flow’rs of love still blooming 
In the garden of your heart.

2. Leave me not in anger, darling. 
Think of all the happy past. 
With its hours of golden pleasure. 
Hours that sped away too fast; 
Think of tender words then spoken, 
When our hearts were fond and true. 
Let not olden ties be broken, 
Ties that bind my life to you.

3. Leave me not in anger, darling. 
There’ll be brighter, happier hours. 
For I’ll ever strew your pathway. 
With life’s rarest, sweetest flow’rs; 
Waiting on your pleasure ever. 
Happy only when you’re near. 
Darling, say you’ll leave me never. 
Let me  always find you here.
