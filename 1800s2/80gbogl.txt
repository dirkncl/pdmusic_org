1. Columbia greatr and glorious,
Our song we raise no thee
The refuge of th’oppressed,
The home of Liberty.
May plenty and contenment
Abound on ev’ryside,
And peace and love fraternal
In all her coast abide.

CHORUS 1-3.
Among her lovely valleys
Her plains and mountains grand,
O let the prayer reecho
God bless our glorious land.

2. All hail the glorious morning,
That first her flag unfurl’d
The envy of the nations,
The glory of the world.
Though tyrants scoff and hate her
Whose rule is by the sword.
They dare not but respect her
And tremble at her word..

3. Should ememies or danger
E’er threaten our fair land,
May heav’n protect her borders
And smite each hostile hand;
Her starry flag in glory
Still wave from sea to sea
And justice reign triumphant
And ev’ry man be free.
