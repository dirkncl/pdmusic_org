1. Often weary and worn on the pathway below,
When the burden is heavy, my heart throbs with woe;
Oh, there comes a sweet whisper to quell ev’ry sigh,
Do not faint ’neath the load, there is rest by and by.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
There is rest by and by,
(There is rest by and by, there is rest by and by,)
In the beautiful city there is rest by and by.
Where the ransom’d shall live with the Savior on high,
In the beautiful city there is is rest by and by.

2. You will not labor long for the Master below,
Soon his call you will hear, your free spirit shall go
To the light of his presence in mansions on high,
Where the faithful repose, there is rest by and by.

3. Then, dear, Savior, I would not in sadness repine,
Nor would here on a bed of sweet roses recline;
For a country I seek where they nevermore die,
And in Zion my home, there is rest by and by.
