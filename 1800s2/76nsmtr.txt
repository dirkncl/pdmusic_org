1. Nightingale, nightingale,
Where have you been so long?
Wilt thou not sing again
Thy lovely song?
Here in the forest green,
Here reigneth peace and rest,
Nightengale, nightengale,
Here build thy nest!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sing me to rest,
Sing me to rest,
Nightengale,
Nightengale,
Sing me to rest.

2. Here in the shady woods,
Lingers no secret foe,
Forth from thy little nest,
Thou must not go.
Here in moon’s silv’ry ray,
Clear crystal fountains play,
Nightengale, nightengale,
Fly not away!

3. Nightengale, nightingale,
Oh, do not cease to sing;
Thy tender plaintive notes,
Sweet comfort bring:
Know’st thou the secret woe,
That ever fills my breast?
Nightengale, nightengale,
Sing me to rest!
