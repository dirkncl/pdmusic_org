1.
Oh, my golden slippers am laid away,
Kase I don't 'spect to wear 'em till my weddin' day,
And my long-tail'd coat, dat I loved so well,
I will wear up in de chariot in de morn;
And my long, white robe  dat I bought last June,
I'm gwine to get changed Kase it fits too soon,
And de ole grey hoss dat I used to drive,
I will hitch him up to de chariot in de morn.

CHORUS 2 times
Oh, dem golden slippers! Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers I'm gwine to wear, becase dey look so neat;
Oh, dem golden slippers! Oh, dem golden slippers!
Golden slippers Ise gwine to wear, To walk de golden street.

2.
Oh, my ole banjo hangs on de wall,
Kase it aint been tuned since way las fall,
But de darks all say we will had a good time,
When we ride up in de chariot in de morn;
Dat's ole Brudder Ben and Sister Luce,
Dey will telegraph de news to Uncle Bacco Juice,
What a great camp-meetin' der will be dat dey,
When we ride up in de chariot in de morn.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
So, it's good bye, children, I will have to go
Whar de rain don't fall or de wind don't blow,
And yer ulster coats, why, yer will not need,
When yer ride up in de chariot in de morn;
But yer golden slippers must be nice and clean,
And yer age must be Just sweet sixteen,
And yer white kid gloves yer will have to wear,
When yer ride up in de chariot in de morn.

(CHORUS 2 times)
