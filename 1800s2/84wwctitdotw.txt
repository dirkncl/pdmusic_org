1.
We were comrades close together when the boys march'd away;
In hard times we were faithful and in good times we were gay;
And sometimes we were longing for the dear ones afar--
We were comrades together in the days of the war.

CHORUS
Don't you hear the bugle calling, comrades, today?
Echoing still in mem'ry of the days passed away!
Rally round the campfire, from near and from far;
We were comrades together in the days of the war.

2.
We have march'd along together in the sun and the rain;
We've faced the fight together, and together borne the pain!
And each one tells the story of the wound or the scar--
We were comrades together in the days of the war.

(CHORUS)

3.
To the dear ones gone before us, here's a health, comrades all!
We soon shall go to meet them, at the last great bugle call!
Beneath the star of Liberty, the bright shining star--
We'r growing old together since the days of the war.

(CHORUS)
