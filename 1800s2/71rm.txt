1. You said to me the word farewell, 
At evenings gentle close; 
When bright the pearly dewdrops fell, 
Upon the blushing rose. 
The stars in the blue arch above, 
Were twinkling bright and free; 
With bitter grief my heart did move, 
To say remember me, 
  With bitter grief my heart did move, 
  To say remember me.

2. When you within your happy home, 
Shall stand again once more; 
When kindly hearts to you shall come, 
With friendship’s priceless  lore. 
When fond caress and loving kiss, 
Shall greet you joyfully, 
I ask thee not amid sucn bliss, 
To then remember me. 
  I ask thee not amid such bliss, 
  To then remember me.

3. When music low, sweet and serene, 
Shall float upon the air, 
And you shall move amid the scene, 
Young beautiful and fair. 
Let not a thought of joy you’ve met, 
Intrude upon thy glee, 
To cause a feeling of regret, 
As you remember me. 
  To cause a feeling of regret, 
  As you remember me.

4. But when comes on the dusky night,
And hides the daylights’ gleam,
While stars above shed silver light,
And rich the moon’s bright beam.
When forms of friends loved in the past,
Shall rise in memory,
And o’er thy soul a sadness cast,
Oh then remember me.
  And o’er thy soul a sadness cast,
  Oh then remember me.
