1. Dreaming ever, fondly dreaming,
In the twilight softly beaming,
Thoughts of beauty ever teaming,
Bring the days of long ago!
Happy moments gone forever;
Loving faces, coming never;
Gone beyond the hearts endeaver,
Gone in all their youthful glow!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dreaming ever, fondly dreaming,
In the twilight softly beaming,
Thoughts of beauty ever teaming,
Bring the days of long ago!

2. Loving voices wake to cheer me;
Olden places linger near me;
Gentle mem’ries still endear me;
Bind me to the golden past!
Kindly whispers, fond, entreating;
Childhoods pleasant, merry greeting;
Ever linger, still repeating,
While the spell is o’er me cast!

3. Dreaming ever, fondly dreaming,
In the starlight softly beaming,
All me sorrow ’tis redeaming,
Thus to live the past again!
Weary footsteps onward wending,
O, the visions all unending,
Past and present ever blending
Lifting all our earthly pain!
