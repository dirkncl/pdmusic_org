1. Your love has called me back again, 
Though far apart our path have strayed! 
My life was sad with weary pain, 
But now the sunlight follows shade. 
The joys we shared once more shall be, 
And bliss within each heart shall reign; 
Thro’ all you still were dear to me,— 
Your love has called me back aagain! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
The Future holds its joys in store,— 
Your love has called me back again! 

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
The Past shall grieve on nevermore, 
For with it fades each tho’t of pain; 
The Future holds its joys in store,— 
Your love has called me back again!

2. Thro’ tears mine eyes have gazed afar 
Since last we whispered and “goodbye!” 
Your love to me has been the star 
To guide me ’neath a foreign sky. 
Each thought of mine was will of you; 
And angry pride I knew would wane; 
Your heart was ever fond and true,— 
Your love has called me back again!

3. Your love has called me back again, 
No more, no more on earth to part! 
And ev’ry thought of weary pain 
Shall banished be from our your heart! 
Oh, why should angry pride be ours? 
Let you withing our hearts remain; 
Be mine to strew your path with flowers,— 
Your love has called me back again!
