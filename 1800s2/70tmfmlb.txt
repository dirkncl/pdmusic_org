1. Come mamma the bright sun is rising. 
The birds are now singing so gay. 
Oh why do you keep me here waiting. 
I want to get up now and play. 
Let me run out in the sunlight. 
Just see how it shines on the floor. 
And Kitty is up now and waiting 
For me to come open the door.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come mamma now don’t keep me waiting. 
O now you have heard what I’ said. 
O come quick for Kitty is scolding. 
And take me from my little bed.

2. I don’t want to sleep any longer. 
I’ve been so still all the night through. 
I’m tired now of sleeping and dreaming. 
And now I want something to do. 
It’s time now for all to be stirring. 
O how can you so quiet be. 
I want to go out there with Kitty 
For she is there waiting for me.
