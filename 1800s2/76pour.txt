1.
Oh! when I was a little piccaninny,
  I used to lub ole massa and missus too,
Dey brought me all de way from ole Virginny,
  And not much work dey eber made me do;

But, now I'm growning old, yes, old and feeble,
  My hair is almost turning into grey;
When de leaves begin to brown upon de tree, yes!
  'Tis den ole Uncle Rufe will pass away.

CHORUS
So muffle up de banjo, put away de bones,
De jawbone and de fiddle hold aloof, "Good Lamb,"

Hang my old white hat on de peg behind de door,
  And say good bye to poor old Uncle Rufe.
Hang my old white hat on de peg behind de door,
  And say good bye to poor old Uncle Rufe.

2.
De Lord has gib me orders to be ready,
  And I'll be on hand when Gabriel blow his horn,
I bress de Lord for keeping me so steady,
  To meet him up on high when I am gone;

For dey say dat heaben is a mighty kingdom,
  Wid corn and cotton fields so bright and gay,
Where dere is no oberseer, and but one master,
  And from dere, de darkies never run away.

(CHORUS)
