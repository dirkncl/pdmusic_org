1. Down beneath the hill, stands my Grandfather's mill, 
Where the stream sweeps joyously by; 
And there on its shore, 
Stands the tall Sycamore, 
And its course never yet ran dry.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Rumble, jumble, rumble, jumble, 
Went my Grandfather's mill, 
Rumble, rumble, jumble, jumble, 
Scarcely ever still; 
When I was a boy, 
It was my greatest joy, 
To listen to the noise of the mill.

2. It click'd, click'd, away in rain or shine, each day,
Its music was sweet to my ears;
The vibrating sound,
Made clust'ring hills resound,
Thro' the season year after year.

3. I recall at will, the quaint old dusty mill,
And the stream of bright golden grain,
That poured in the burr,
Which flew round with a whirr,
As I've watch'd it time and again.

4. 'Twas a happy life for him and his good wife,
For he always took honest toll;
He would do no ill, his deep pockets to fill,
But each day he cared for his soul.

5. When the wheel went round, the farmer's grist was ground,
But now it is silent and still,
Tears bedew the eye, as oft as I pass by,
That now lone old moss cov'ered mill.
