1. Oh, darkies I have grown so weary,
A roaming far from you,
The world it seems so cold and dreary,
I don’t know what to do.
My eyes are growing dim with blindness,
my hair is white as snow,
And no one speaks a work of kindness,
To poor old uncle Joe.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, I can hear sweet voices singing,
No matter where I go,
Sweet memories their tones are bringing,
To poor old uncle Joe.

2. I long to see the home of childhood,
The cotton and the corn,
The little cabin in the wildwood,
The place where I was born.
I’d like to see the sunshine
falling across the fields of snow,
And hear the mocking bird a calling,
“Come back old uncle Joe.”

3. Oh, tell me, do the folks down yonder,
Around the cabin stay?
Or have they sadly gone to wander
So very far away.
Say, do they speak of my returning
to scenes of long ago?
Oh, do they keep the light a burning,
For poor old uncle Joe?
