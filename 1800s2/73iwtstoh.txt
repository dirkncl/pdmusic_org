1.
I've wandered very far away
  From the clime where I was born,
And my poor heart has been so sad,
  Dejected and forlorn;
No master kind, to treat me well,
  To cheer me when in pain,
I want to see the cotton fields,
  And the dear old home again.

CHORUS
Oh, the good old days are pass'd and gone,
  I sigh for them in vain;
I want to see the cotton fields,
  And the dear old home again.

2.
I'm left all sad and lonely now,
  When my days are very few,
My wife and children both are gone,
  I don't know what to do;
Old master too, he may be dead,
  His hair was turning gray,
Oh! let me see that good old home,
  Before I pass away.

(CHORUS)

3.
When I was free, I left that land,
  Where the days are bright and fair,
Where Missus spoke of me so kind,
  When I was bow'd with care;
I left that home no friends to find,
  My heart was fill'd with pain,
Oh! take me to that good old home,
  To see it once again.

(CHORUS)
