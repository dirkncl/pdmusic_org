1.
At midnight the summons awoke us,
Our dear little Grace must go
To the City all shining with silver,
Far over the hills of snow,
The mother sat weeping and moaning,
Oh! Jesus, dear Jesus, I pray
Leave wide the bright gates, that our darling
May seem not so far away.

CHORUS
Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark!
List what the angels say,
"The gates of the beautiful City
Are open by night and by day."

2.
Then sweet was the voice of the Master,
"Oh! sorrowing heart, be still,
Look up where the towers of jasper
Stand firm on the Golden hill.
'Tis only a step to the glory
That seemeth so far away,
Close by in the garden of lillies
The feet of thy darling stray."

(CHORUS)

3.
'Tis only the blindness of weeping,
That hideth thy lov'd ones face,
Where shining in raiment of Angels
She smiles from her heav'nly place.
For list the low chanting of voices
And hear what the Angels say.
Close by in the gardens of lillies
The feet of thy darling stray.

(CHORUS)

4.
The steps to her palace are golden,
And over the shining stairs
The feet of our beautiful Angel
Steel softly and unawares.
And often she stands in the portal
And lingering seems to say
"There's room, and the gates of the city
Are open both night and day."

(CHORUS)
