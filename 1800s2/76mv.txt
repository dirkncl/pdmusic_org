1.
I folded a little missive
And call'd it a Valentine
And sent it away its hidden freight
From this fluttering heart of mine.
"Haste, little Valentine, hasten!"
I cried, and carry for me
Wither my thoughts already are flown
The secret I trust to thee,
Wither my thoughts already are flown
The secret I trust to thee.

2.
And so my poor little message
Like a white dove flew away,
And I watched for its mate to return to me
Ere the close of another day
But we grew of waiting,
So weary, my heart and I,
That we could not wait for the day to pass
So wearily crept it by,
That we could not wait for the day to pass,
So wearily crept it by.

3.
So I went myself for an answer
And somebody bade me see,
If there were not also a Valentine
Some where awaiting me,
I searched the whole room over
In ev'ry nook and part,
But my Valentine only was found at last
Safe hidden in somebody's heart,
But my Valentine only was found at last
Safe hidden in somebody's heart.
