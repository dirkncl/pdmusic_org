1. Oh, robin, sweet robin, fly over the lea, 
And sing to a song of my dear one afar! 
Oh, tell me if some one is thinking of me, 
And if we shall meet at the first evening star. 
The day is so lonely and sad, 
While some one is gone from my side; 
One whisper, sweet robin would make me so glad, 
Then bring me a message o’er meadow so wide!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Ah! Oh, robin, sweet robin, fly over to me, 
And bring me a word from the heart that I love; 
Oh, gentle and kind will our fond meeting be, 
When bright silver stars are in Heaven above!

2. Oh, robin, sweet robin, sing gayly today, 
And bid me to hope that I’m loved still the same; 
Oh, linger no more on the blossoming spray, 
But whisper unto me one dear loving name. 
The heart in my bosom is gone, 
It followed the one that’s so dear, 
And tireless and joyless it still wanders on, 
Till some one shall find it and bring it back here!

3. Oh, robin, sweet robin, fly quickly to me, 
And make in my bosom your own downy nest; 
But whisper your secret from far o’er the lea, 
And tell me that somebody loves me the best. 
The twilight is coming again, 
And soon will your song die away; 
Oh, robin sweet robin, I list to your strain, 
That tells we shall meet at the close of the day!
