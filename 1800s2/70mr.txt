1. Draw the curtain, close the door.
Shut out all the curious throng: 
From this troubled earthly shore.
Mother’s gone a journey long 
Fold with rev’rent, tender touch.
All the things she used to wear.
Can we prize them overmuch!
Shall thye not have tend’rest care!

CHORUS [sung after each verse; and repeated 'pp' after last verse]
Mother’s gone. Mother’s gone.
[Mother’s gone, yes, our mother has gone, mother’s gone.]
How we miss her none can tell [none can tell].
From this troubled earthly shore[, earthly shore], 
Gone with angels fair to dwell[, forevermore]. 

2. All the things that seattered be 
Books, and work, and chair, and stand, 
They have met her loving eye.
They have felt her kindly hand: 
They are sacred evermore.
Set them safely, softly by.
Draw the curtains, close the door.
Shut out ev’ry curious eye.

3. Mother’s room is lonely now;
Once it was our blest retreat;
Often here on cheek and brow,
Fell our mother’s kisses sweet.
Here our little company
knelt around in humble prayer;
Now it wrings our hearts to see
Closéd Word and vacant chair.

4. Mother’s gone a journey long;
How we miss her none can tell.
For our love was true and strong
But the angels loved her well.
So one morn the summons came.
Earth receded from her view,
Joy ecstatic filled her soul,
All the peace of heaven she knew.
