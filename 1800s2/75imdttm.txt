1. Little birdie sweetly singing, 
In the warm and azure sky; 
Have you seen my little sweetheart, 
Have you watched her roaming by? 
Will she meet me in the twilight, 
Shall I then my darling see? 
Tell me tell me little birdie, 
Is my darling true to me?

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Birdie tell me, birdie tell me, 
With you voice of melody, 
Tho’ the world should all forsake me, 
Is my darling true to me?

2. Little darling, you will know her, 
Know her by her many eyes; 
Oh, she is the fairest blossom 
You could find beneath the skies. 
Bear to me her loving message, 
O’er the sweet and rosy lea; 
Whisper whisper, none will hear you. 
Is my darling true to me?
