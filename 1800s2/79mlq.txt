1.
[SOLO]
My queen, my little bright-eyed fairy queen,
I give all my treasures unto thee!
For I am but thy willing slave,
And thou art all my life to me.
[DUET]
Bright and fair thy kingdom e'er should be,
Where ev'ry foe to love must fall!
My queen, ah! my winsome little fairy queen,
Thou'lt reign, the brightest of them all.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[SATB] O, Queen of ev'ry loving heart
[B] (of ev'ry loving heart,)
[SATB] O, Queen of ev'ry loving heart,
[A] (of ev'ry loving heart,)
[SA] Thou shalt rule and love forever,
[SATB] Yes, my love, my darling, and my queen.
[B] (my little queen.)

2.
[SOLO]
My queen, with golden hair and violet eyes;
With lips like a coral of the deep;
Thy form will linger in my dreams,
Thy voice seems singing while I sleep.
[DUET]
Thou art fair as fairest summer flow'rs,
Blooming o'er meadowland and lea;
Thy kingdom is ev'rywhere that Love doth dwell;
Then let me humble bow to thee.
