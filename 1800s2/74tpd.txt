1.[Mrs. Pig.]
Five little pigs lived in a sty,
  As tidy as they might,
Although they were more happy lose
  To find an appetite;
[Mr. Pig.]
There was missus Pig and mister Pig,
  Their daughter and her bean.
And a tiny runt who had a corn,
  Upon his Potatoe. 

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
[Both]
This little pig to market went,
And this one stay’d at home;
This little pig had nice roast beef,
This little runy had none.
[Mr. Pig.]
This little runt was sent to school,
Where he was taught to speak,
[Both]
But all that he could learn to say,
Was week, week, week.

2. [Mrs. Pig.]
The mama wore a Redingote,
  The pa a greasy tile,
And struck it on his great pig head
  In great pig headed style;
[Mr. Pig.]
The daughter wore a big chignon,
  Her beau had muddy boots.
And tiny used a root for grub,
  And sometimes grub for roots.

2. [Mrs. Pig.]
The daughter though she long had, had
  Her eye upon the sty,
Delayed her wedding for she had,
  A sty upon her eye,
[Mr. Pig.]
But when ’twas well to cut a swell
  They bought all sorts of things;
They’d rings in all their noses,
  And their tails were all in rings.
