1. 
Close your eyes, Lena, my darling,
While I sing you lullaby, fear thou no danger, Lena,
Move not, dear Lena, my darling,
For you brouder watches nigh you, Lena dear.
Angels guard thee, Lena, dear, my darling.
Nothing evil can come near;
Brightest flowers bloom for thee,
Darling sister, dear to me.

CHORUS
Go to sleep, go to sleep, my baby, my baby, my baby,
Go to sleep, my baby, baby, oh, bye,
Go to sleep, Lena, sleep.

2. 
Bright be de morning, my darling,
You you ope you eyes, sunberams give all around you, Lene.
Peach be with thee, love, my darling.
Blue and cloudless be the sky for Lena dear.
Birds sing their bright songs for thee, my darling,
Full of sweetest melody,
Angels ever hover near,
Darling sister, dear to me.
