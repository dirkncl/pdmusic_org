1. Before my old grandmother died,
 She left as a keepsake to me,
The oldfashioned clock on the shelf;
 Its equal you never can see.
  It runs ev’ry day,
  And it never goes astray;
True as the bright shining sun,
 Tick, tick, tick it goes, tick, tick, tick,
And its work is never done.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Grandmother’s clock is dusty and old,
But it runs ev’ry day thro’ heat and cold;
Tick, tick, tick it goes, tick, tick, tick,
And its work is never done.

2. It brings me sweet mem’ries of old,
 To me ’tis a treasure most dear,
A lifetale it seems to unfold,
 ’Tis something to love and revere.
  It shows well its age,
  And it seems a written page;
Faithful the hands creep around;
 Tick, tick, tick it goes, tick, tick, tick,
With the same unceasing sound.

3. The days and the years may roll on,
 But true to my charge I will be;
The old clock I’ll keep in my care,
 As long as there’s life left in me.
  My grandmother said,
  As she lay upon her bed,
“Take care of the old clock, my son.”
 Tick, tick, tick it goes, tick, tick, tick,
And its work is never done.
