1.
Went to de church de other night,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
To hear de colored folks sing and pray,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
Old Pomp got tight and Dinah walk along,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
And made old Gumbo sing a song,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!

CHORUS
Car'line, Car'line, can't you dance de peavine,
Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!


2.
Dar was a bullfrog dressed in soldier clothes,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
He went out to drill dem crows,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
But de bullfrog he made such a mighty splutter,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
Dat I up wid my foot and kicked him in de water,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!

(CHORUS)

3.
I carried a hen coop on my knee,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
'Twas nothing but a rooster saying his prayers,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!
He gave out a hymn, such a getting up stairs,
  Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!

(CHORUS)
