1. I used to think ’twas jolly to go upon a spree,
And get so awful tipsy that I could hardly see;
I’d do all sorts of silly things, and say, “Jes lem me be!”
But now I’m getting wiser,— No more brown jugs for me!

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
I signed the pledge on the New Year’s,
I will sober be;
Yes, I’ll sing forever,
No brown jugs for me!

2. One day when riding homeward upon a crowded ’bus,
I fell off on the sidewalk, and made an awful fuss;
I shouted to the driver, who was struggling with a cough—
And told him he tipped over, or I’d not have got off!

3. How well do I remember when Brown and Jones and I
Went on a reg’lar bendder, and got quite full of rye;
I harnessed them into a cart, and drove them out of town,
I sold Jones for ten dollars, and swapp’d a pig for Brown!

4. But now I’ve seen my folly, and, taught in life’s hard school,
I find it is much better, not to be such a fool.
My jug is broke, my clothes are new, I’m healthy, rich and free,
And I can sing right merry, no more brown jugs for me!
