1. I wonder what Grandma is thinking about, 
As she sits in the corner there 
With the firelight shining into her eyes 
And ov er her silvery hair; 
She has laid her knitting across her knee, 
And folded her hands so thin, 
And I know her thoughts are far away, 
Inspite of the children’s din, 
And I know her thoughts are far away, 
Inspite of the children’s din.

2. I’m sure ’tis something strange and sweet, 
That brightens her eyes so dim. 
Perhaps she is seeing the golden gates, 
And hearing the angels’ hymn! 
And she smiles, while thinking she soon will cross, 
Where the wonderful river rolls, 
There to gather flow’rs of youth again 
In the beautiful garden of souls, 
There to gather flow’rs of youth again 
In the beautiful garden of souls.
