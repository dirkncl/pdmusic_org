1. Peacefully, dreamily, baby dear sleep. 
Watchfully, prayerfully, I’ll vigils keep. 
Has baby trouble or why does he frown? 
Quietly, dream away, sleep trouble down. 
Castles fair in the air baby shall own. 
Roses sweet ’neath his feet shall be then strewn. 
Baby mine, will the time ever come near 
For you to love Mama less, will it be dear?

2. Baby dear, jealously, over thy bed, 
Mama so loving now watches with dread 
Thinking of days when to manhood you’ve grown. 
Baby dear shall my love be aside thrown. 
Should the day ever come, should the cloud break 
When for another one, me you’ll forsake.  
You’ll never know of it, now hear a cry. 
’Twould break my heart, Baby dear, mamma would die.

3. Sleep awhile longer yet with your cheek press’d 
Closer to little head so still in rest. 
Sleep for awaking will only bring pain. 
Close your eyes, Baby mine, shut them again. 
Cosily turning with opened blue eyes 
And I see in their depths how much love lies. 
Outstretched arms unto me, wanting to come 
O Darling boy always long thus to come home.
