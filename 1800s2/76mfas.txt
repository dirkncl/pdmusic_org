1.
It was a dread and fearful night,
As though the flames and smoke they frantic fled.
Struggling on, alas, they perish,
One by one they fall and die;
They whom kindred love and cherish—
Hear their wild and pitroud cry!
Sad and dreary, Oh, what anguish,
What emotion and despair;
As in death they sink and languish,
Bright ones, beautiful and fair.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Struggling on, alas, they perish,
One by one they fall and die;
They whom kindred love and cherish—
Hear their wild and piteous cry.

2.
The flames and smoke in fury roll,
Hear’st thou the moan of that distracted soul?
Save! Oh save me! trembling, dying,
Sad and mournfully they cried.
See the daring Fireman flying
To their rescue, e’er they died;
From the fiery gulf he bears them,
Safely, in their pain and fright;
He has rescued, he has saved them,
From a dreadful death and night.
