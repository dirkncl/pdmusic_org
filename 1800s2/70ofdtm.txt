[* or Willie]
1. Our Freddie* died this morning,
’Twas before the break of day
That he call’d us to his bedside,
And bade us all to pray.
He said the angels call’d him
To a palace in the skies;
He told us not to mourn for him,
But dry our weeping eyes.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, Freddie*, darling Freddie*,
You have left us here to weep,
Could we only wake you, angel,
From that everlasting sleep.

2. Our Freddie* died this morning,
Oh, his pretty little face,
Will ne’er again the schoolroom
Or our lonely circle grace.
As he sleeps here in the coffin,
So pale and calm at rest,
We sigh, for of our flock he was
The sweetest and the best.

3. Our Freddie* died this morning—
Yet it seems but yesterday
That we saw him in the garden
With the boys and girls at play;
That voice that was so merry,
So innocent and kind,
Pure as the Zephyr’s music
Runs thro’ our weary mind.

4. Our Freddie* died this morning—
To morror ’neath the sod
His little body will be laid,
But his soul will be with God.
Death, the harvester, has call’d him
To a better land than this,
Where with angels as companions
He will live in peace and bliss.
