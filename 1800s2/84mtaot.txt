1.
Darling I'm lonely, for thee now I sigh;
Give me one glance of thy love beaming eye.
Smile on me now as you smiled long ago.
Lift from my bosom its burden of woe.
Come with thy glances you gave me of yore.
Let me delight in thy presence once more.
Ah! Ah! Love's golden sunshine again let me see.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Near thee or absent my thoughts are of thee.
Near thee or absent my thoughts are of thee.

2.
Turn not in anger but smile on me now.
Let no dark frown shade thy  beautiful brow.
Long have we wandered life's path way apart.
Come to me darling, sweet light of my heart.
Thou art my solace when wand'ring afar.
Light if my life and its bright beaming star.
Ah! Ah! Turn not away then my darling from me.

3.
Bright are the mem'ries of days that are gone.
Days when thy hearts fondest love was my own.
Sweet were the moments when hope beaming high,
Shone on our way like a star in the sky.
Bring back those moments of pleasure again,
Ease my poor heart of its sorrow and pain.
Ah! Ah! Come with thy brightness and beauty to me.
