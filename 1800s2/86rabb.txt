"Rock-a-Bye Baby" (Waltz) (1886)
Song and Lullaby
Words and Music by Effie I. Canning
from "Songs of the Old Homestead" (No. 6)

1.
Baby is sleeping so cozy and fair,
While mother sits near in her old oaken chair,
Her foot on the rocker the cradle she swings,
And though baby slumbers he hears what she sings.

LULLABY
Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,
When the wind blows the cradle will rock,
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,
And down will come baby, cradle and all.

[a tempo]
Oh rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, mother is near,
Then rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, nothing to fear,
For angels of slumber are hovering near,
So rock-a-bye, baby, mother is here.

2.
Grandma sits knitting close by the fireplace,
With snowy white hair and a smile on her face,
The years have passed by, yet it does not seem long,
Since she rocked baby's papa to sleep with that song.

(LULLABY)
([a tempo])

3.
Dear little baby, their joy and their prode,
Long may he be with them whatever betide,
The kitchen, the cradle, that tender refrain,
In mem'ry will linger that lullaby strain.

(LULLABY)
([a tempo])
