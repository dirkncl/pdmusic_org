1. Bands of bright hair gently twining
Round a sweet and winsome face,
Eyes the dewy stars outshining,
Link’d with form of fairy grace.
Sweeter than the blushing roses,
Queen enough to wear a crown,
Not a thought of guile reposes
In the heart of Mollie Brown.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE (with some ATB voice overlapping)]
Dearest Mollie, Sweetest Mollie
(Dearest, dearest Mollie, Sweetest, sweetest Mollie)
Brown, Mollie Brown? Always smile and never frown,
Do you know how well we love you Pretty little Mollie Brown?

2. From the angels as a blessing
Was our little Mollie sent,
Just for kissing and caressing,
Just for summer sunshine lent.
May her life be one of pleasure;
Darken’d by no tear or frown,
While our hearts will fondly treasure
Pretty little Mollie Brown.
