1. It was a lover and his lass, 
With a hey and a ho.
With a hey and a ho, and a hey, and a hey-non-i-no!
That o’er the green cornfield dispass, 
In the springtime, the springtime, 
The only pretty ringtime, 
When birds do sing hey ding a ding!
Sweet lovers love the spring.

2.
And therefore take the present time, 
With a hey and a ho, 
With a hey and a ho, and a hey, and a hey-non-i-no!
For love is crowned with the prime, 
In the springtime, the springtime,
The only pretty ringtime, 
When birds do sing hey ding a ding!
Sweet lovers love the spring.
