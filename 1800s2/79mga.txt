1. I treasure my dear old Gandpa's advice, 
That so gave to me long years ago, 
When I was a child and sat on his knee, 
While watching the fire’s reddy glow, 
The proverbs have served me in moments of doubt, 
I repeat them wherever I be, 
And bless him for sayings that serve me so well, 
By teaching the lesson to me.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then Dare, forsake whate’re you know is wrong, 
And Dare to rise, though Dare, though oft you be cast down. 
The poor and the needy you never should slight, 
Do what your conscious says is right. right.

2. Too soon you will see the world and its frowns,
When in moments of sorrow and strife.
You’ll prosper and win, if honest you be,
Tho’ dark for a time be your life,
The gloom will then fade and the sunlight appear,
Make hay while the sunbeams remain,
And never dispair when adversity comes,
Have courage to try, try again.

3. Be true to the world though it be false to you,
And remember that honor and truth,
Will surely prevail and triumph at last
Tho’ dark be the days of your youth,
Dear Grandfather sleeps ’neath the grave’s cold sod,
But his kind words still ring in my ear
In moments of peril, or hours that are sad,
His spirit seems hovering near.
