1.
I'm gwine away by the light of the moon,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
I hope I'll meet you darkies soon,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

So tell the brothers that you meet,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
That I will travel on my feet,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

CHORUS
In the morning, morning by the bright light,
Hear Gabriel's trumpet in the morning!

2.
Go get a match and light that lamp,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
And show me the way to the Babtist camp,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

We'll have beefsteak and sparerib stew,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
And nice boiled onions dipped in dew,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

(CHORUS)

3.
I'll take my old banjo along,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
In case the boys should sing a song,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

For no one has to pay no fare,
  Want all the children for to follow me;
So don't forget to curl your hair,
  Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah!

(CHORUS)
