"Love's Old Sweet Song" (1884)
Words by C. Clifton Bingham, 1859-1913
Music by James Lyman Molloy, 1837-1909

1.
Once in the dear dead days beyond recall,
When on the world the began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose on happy throng
Low to our hearts Love sung an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.

[CHORUS]
Just a song at twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flick'ring shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
come Love's old sweet song.

2.
Even today we hear Love's song of yore,
Deep in our hearts it dwells forever more
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,
Still we can hear it at the close of day,
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

([CHORUS])
