1. Oh, beautiful Major Gilfeather!
The ladies remark with a sigh;
Oh, gracious! oh, my! did you ever
Observe such a beautiful eye?
The choicest of choice conversation,
I give to the ladies, oh, dear!
In hotel, in parlor, or station,
Oh, this is the language I hear:—

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather?
I’m a little bit under the weather!
It’s smilingly, then I’d endeavor
To borrow a five, do you see?
Oh, take it, and keep it forever,—
My friendship for you cannot sever,
For you are so royally clever!—
Oh, meaning the Major, that’s me!—

2. To dinner I’m often invited,
It’s out of my style to decline;
With rapture and joy I’m delighted,
And often prostrated with wine;
The ladies they say I’m bewitching,
In fact, I’m a real belvidere!
In ballroom, in parlor, or kitchen,
Oh, this is the language I hear:—

3. The tailors and barbers all know me,
They’re envious of my great success,
They say come and pay what you owe me!
I give them my name and address;
I leave them to mingle with fashion,
Their voices grate hard on my ear;
When hungry, and needing a ration,
Oh, this is the language I hear:—
