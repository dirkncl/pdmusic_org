1. Oh we are six miserable ruffians,
Who havent got a single thing to do,
And we scorn such stuff as tea and muffians,
But gore we’ll drink, we’ll drink till all is blue.
By day we hunting after gold are,
By night we burn and rob and steal,
For we bad and muscular and bold are,
And gore it is our best beloved meal.

CHORUS 1
We’re a gang no traveler is sweet with,
And a warning we will kindly give to you,
That you’d best lie low if you should meet with
This gold pursueing gore imbibing crew.

2. We’re the miscreant you read about in novels,
But never see except up on the stage,
Who live in remote and lonely hovels,
And with all mankind a warfare wage.
Oh our hearts are as blackened as our hair is,
And we always go about with knife in hand,
For to kill some one our only care is,
In fact we are the terror of the land.

CHORUS 2
We’re the regular conventional marauders,
Ho! Ho! is the only laugh allowed,
And our only hope is that you will applaud us
As a gold pursueing gore imbibing crowd.
