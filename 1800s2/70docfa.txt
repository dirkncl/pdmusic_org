1. Spirit form’s are hov’ring nigh,
As I sit so sad and lone;
Thinking of the happier days,
And the dear ones that are gone;
Lov’d ones linger by my side,
Leave me not alone I pray;
Wife and children now are here,
Gentle spirits stay, Oh stay.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Now they beckon to me come,
From this world so sad and drear;
Darling ones come from above,
Gentle spirits linger near.
  Oh, linger near.

2. Spirit form’s are hov’ring nigh,
Wafting words of cheer to me;
Telling me; “earth I must leave,”
With them forever happy be;
Little faces smile so sweet,
Could I clasp them to me heart;
And they beckon to me come,
Gentle spirits must we part.
