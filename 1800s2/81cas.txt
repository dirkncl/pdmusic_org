1. Oh what will you do when de great day’s acomin? 
How am you gwine for to speckerlate? 
When you’ve a found all your darkies a lookin 
To lift de latch ob de gol den gate. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out sinner. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out late. 
Dat am de time you will get no dinner, 
And be lock’d from de golden gate.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come along sinners, 
Come along sinners, 
Come along sinners a hoopin. 
Come along sinners, 
Come along sinners, 
Come along sinners to Glory.

2. Oh what will you do when de bells am a singin? 
What will you do while de angels wait? 
When you’ve a called fer to pass in yer tazors 
And stood stiff kneed to de golden gate. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out sinner. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out late. 
Hurry along or you’ll get no dinner, 
And be lock’d from de golden gate. 

3. Oh what will you do when de Satan’s a coming? 
What will you do when he hunts his match? 
When you’ve a hearin de fire a rizzen, 
And can’t get nigh to de golden gate. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out sinner. 
Dat am de time you’ll get left out late. 
Dat am de time you will get you dinner, 
Underneath ob de golden gate.
