1. How sweet the dawn of life’s young day,
When all around is blithe and gay:
When wing’d by joy our moments fly,
Ere yet the bosom learns to sigh!
Dear is the quiet happy home,
Where once we pass’d our childhood’s hours;
Our greatest bliss abroad to roam,
And twine our wreaths of summer flow’rs,
And twine our wreaths, our wreaths of summer flow’rs.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

2. In after times, as we grow old,
When love is dead and friends are cold:
The mind will turn to that dear spot,
Tho’ there perchance we are forgot!
And Oh! ’tis sweet to be recall’d,
By mem’ry back to childhood’s hours;
And while by fancy’s wand enthrall’d,
To dream we still may twine the flow’rs,
To dream we still may twine, may twine the flow’rs.
