1. Love that hath us in the net, 
Can be pass and we forget? 
Many suns arise and set. 
Many a chance the years beget; 
Love the gift is love the debt, 
Even so, even so.

2. Love is hurt with jar and fret, 
Love is made a vague regret, 
Eyes with i dle tears are wet. 
Idle habit links us yet; 
What is love? for we forget, 
Ah, no, no, ah, no, no!
