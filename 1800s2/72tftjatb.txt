1. Come arouse ye, arouse ye, my merry brave boys, 
Come arouse ye to labor away! 
While our hearts are so full of expectant joys. 
And so brightl ly dawns the day, 
And so brightly dawns the day.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Let us vote with a will, 
For Ulysses still, 
For the firm, and the just, and the brave! 
[CHORUS for Male Voices]
Let us vote with a will 
For Ulysses still, 
For the firm, and the just, and the brave!

2. Come arouse ye, arouse ye, my merry brave boys, 
Come let us up to the poles away! 
And remove from the field those so dangerous toys, 
Which “old Greeley” is scheming to play, 
Which “old Greeley” is scheming to play.

3. We remember too well what the rebels have done, 
To endang er the Union we love! 
And we swear by the blood of our “brave boys in blue,” 
We’ll be true to the fallen above, 
We’ll be true to the fallen above.

4. We remember too well since the war what they’ve done, 
To endanger the black man’s  rights! 
And we swear by the word which old Abe begun, 
We’ll be true to the cause of our fight, 
We’ll be true to the cause of our fight!
