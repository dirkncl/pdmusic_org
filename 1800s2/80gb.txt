1. There’s a treasure very dear 
I have kept it many a year 
And dearer to my heart it seems to grow. 
It’s a bible old and worn, 
With the corners crushed and torn; 
It was Granny’s in the long, long ago. 
Now poor old Grandmother sleeps in her grave 
But the dear old bible still I save.

[CHORUS (sung after each verse)]
Grandmother’s bible is old and worn 
But I keep it in tenderness and care, 
How often I have seen her sitting by the window, 
Reading in her old rocking chair.

2. Ev’ry Sunday afternoon
In the silent sitting room
She would nestle in the corner all alone
In her snowy ruffled cap,
With the bible in her lap,
She would read it ’till the daylight was gone,
And then she’s smooth it and lay it away
To be read again next Sabbath day.

3. It recalls a peaceful life
Free from ev’ry sin and strife
And a home of love and gladness far away.
It is mark’d by many a hand,
But it’s faded leaves will stand
For the comfort of my heart ev’ry day,
Now poor old Grandmother sleeps in her grave
But the dear old bible still I save.
