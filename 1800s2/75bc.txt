1. Down in the meadow by the brook,
Where first I met my love,
I told her there that I’d be true,
As the shining stars above,
Oh! she’s so fair I do declare
She’s beautiful divine,
The dearest girl and charmer fair
Is beautiful Caroline.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
She’s like a little twinkling star.
She’s so near and yet so far,
The dearest girl and charmer fair,
And all the world besided
Is Caroline this girl of mine
She soon will be my bride.

2. We sat beneath a willow tree,
To watch the running stream
She whisper’d tales of love to me,
It seemed as in a dream,
Oh! The sweet birds sang their evening song,
Which echo’d thro’ the vine,
Each hour seemed a life long dream,
With beautiful Caroline.

3. We sat there ’till the twilight fell,
The moon shone bright and clear,
Come dearest let’s be off for home,
She whisper’d in my ear,
Oh! I say her home and at the gate
The clock then just struk nine,
Of what she said, I think I’ll wed,
My beautiful Caroline.
