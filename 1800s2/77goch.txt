SOLO, Kadsedah.
O golly, aint I happy?
De Yankee's day hab come;
I hear de shout of freedom,
I hear dar fife and drum;
Dar's gwine to be a smash-up,
Dis chile is gettin' shy,
She'll leab de old plantation,
Old cabin home, good-by.

DUET
Good-by, good-by, my dear old cabin home,
Good-by, good-by, I leave thee now to roam
The fields, the brooks, I bid them all farewell,
With hope and joy the heart can never tell.

SOLO, Henry.
De folks of dis cabin
Will leab it all today,
And when dey shut de old door,
You'll hear them sadly say,

[Repeat DUET]

SOLO, Kadsedah.
I'se gwine to leave de canebrake,
I'se gwine to leab de corn,
I'se gwine to be a Yankee,
I is, as sure's you're born.
I aint no 'timidation,
I aint de gal to cry,
But den I choke up funny,
When I say dat word, good-by.

[DUET]

SOLO, Henry.
De mocking-bird am singing,
It seems a doleful lay,
The flowers their heads am drooping,
As if they tried to say,

[DUET]
