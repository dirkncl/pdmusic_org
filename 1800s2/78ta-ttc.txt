Swell the anthem. Raise the song. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Swell the anthem. 
Praises to our God belong. 
Praises to our God belong. 

Crowned with blessings are our days. 
Crowned with blessings are our days. 
Praise the Lord in grateful lays 
Praise the Lord in grateful lays. 

[DUET for Soprano and Alto]
For his goodness we adore him, 
He doth all our wants supply. 
Let us now rejoice before him. 
Raise our songs and voices high. 
[CHORUS]
Raise our songs and voices high. 

Swell the anthem. Raise the song. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Raise the song. Swell the anthem. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Praises to our God belong. 
Praises to our God belong. 

[SOLO Baritone]
The flowery Spring at thy command 
Perfumes the air, adorns the land, 
The summer rays with vigor shine 
To raise the corn 
To cheer the vine. 
Seasons and months and weeks and days 
Demand successive songs of praise 
And be the grateful homage paid 
With morning light and evening shade. 

[CHORUS]
Swell the anthem. Raise the song. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Swell the anthem. 
Praises to our God belong. 
Praises to our God belong.

Swell the anthem. Raise the song. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Raise the song. Swell the anthem. 
Swell the anthem. Swell the anthem. 
Praises to our God belong. 
Praises to our God belong. 

Hallelujah, Praise the Lord. 
Hallelujah, Amen.  
Praise the Lord, O Praise the Lord 
Hallelujah, Praise the Lord.
