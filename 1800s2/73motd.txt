"Minnie of the Dell" (1873)
Song & Chorus
Words by Frances Jane Crosby
Music by G. P. Benjamin

1.
Half concealed among the river
In a music haunted dell,
In a cottage bright and cheerful
That my heart remembers well
In the years that long have vanished
To its rustic porch I strayed
And with Minnie lovely Minnie
Saw the twilight shadows fade.

CHORUS
Gentle Minnie darling Minnie
Still my heart remembers well
Every look of love she gave me
In the music haunted dell.

2.
She was merry as the [?? ??]
When it spirals among the flowers
She was playful as the sunbeam
In the laughing summer bowers
And her birdlike voice rose sweetly
In the dewy evening air
We were happy in each other
And we had no thought of care.

(CHORUS)

3.
But those days have all departed
I am weary and alone
How I miss her welcome footstep
And her dear familiar tone
She is sleeping calmly sleeping
I shall never see here more
Till we meet among the angels
On the ever blooming shore.

(CHORUS)
