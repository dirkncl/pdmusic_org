1. Sailing down time’s rapid stream
Hearts sp free from care and pain
May our paths ere cloudless be
Grief and sorrow on the wane—
Give to me your promise true
In the future we may part
That one boon I begged of you—
Just one place within your heart.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Just on place is all I ask
In the future we may part
Deem it not a weary task
Just one place within your heart.

2. Though the present’s bright and fair
Yet the future is unknown
Who can tell the pain and care
That each one must meet alone—
Yet all trouble fades away
Joy and peace your words impart
If I’m held by mem’ry dear—
Just on place within your heart.
