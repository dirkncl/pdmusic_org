1. I’ve been thinking of the day 
That has long since passed away 
When my mother thro’ a sickness drooped and died 
And the still and silent room. 
When they laid her in the tomb 
I remember then how bitterly I cried 
I but a boy was then, my age was scarcely ten 
And with sorrow I had grown so thin and pale 
When the home had to be sold 
I cried with grief untold 
Oh! save my mother’s picture from the sale.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
My mother’s face, that dear old face, 
Her love I ever shall bewail 
Don’t break an orphan’s heart 
With that don’t make me part 
Oh! save my mother’s picture from the sale.

2. The auctionday came round 
With mirth the room did sound 
The things I loved so well soon passed away 
The chair in which she sat. 
And in which she liked to chat 
That all went into a stranger’s hands that day 
The table where I played, the cot, in which I laid 
All passed away like chaff before the gale 
But when the end came near I cried with piteous fear 
Oh! save my mother’s picture from the sale.

3. The picture round was passed 
And questions they were asked 
A price was bid for it just here and there 
The tears streamed down my face. 
I could scarce keep in the place 
When I saw the picture pass without a care 
But an angel of a girl with a mass of golden curls 
Who was struck to see my face so sad and pale 
She out bid them all you see, 
And presented it to me 
And saved my mother’s picture from the sale.
