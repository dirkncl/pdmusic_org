I stole to the shore, just to see once more 
Willie’s ship ere the close of day. 
And they said, “she’s  sad, lest her sailor lad 
Will forget her when far away.” 
Then I said, Oh, no! let the white sail go, 
Though it carry him o’er the sea; 
For I know it is well, that time should tell, 
My love can be true to me.” 
This spring came again, bad with longing vain, 
I watch’d  far over the sea. 
Till the neighbors said, “thy love is dead, 
Or he is not true to thee.” 
And at last, Oh, at last! when the summer pass’d, 
And my hopes like the dead leaves fell; 
I said never more will I watch by the shore, 
For I dread what the sea may tell. 
One day as I stood in the gray old wood, 
Where we always met by the gate, 
I heard far behind, was it only the wind, 
And why did it linger and wait? 
But a quick step came, and the old sweet name, 
My lips could hardly say, 
Till a voice I knew, said, “love I am true, 
Poor love! was I long away? 
Poor love, poor love, 
Poor love, was I long away?
