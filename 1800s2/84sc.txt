1. There dwells far, far in Northland, 
Mid icebergs, frost and snow, 
A jolly funny fellow, 
Whom children all well know, 
By some he’s called Kris Kringle, 
By some St. Nicholas, 
But what we love to call him, 
Is our dear old Santa Claus.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Three cheers for Kris Kringle, 
Our Santa Claus so kind, 
Hurrah for the stockings, 
Which tomorrow we shall find, 
And praise to the Christ-child, 
Who came long ago, 
To bring peace and gladness, 
To this sinful world below.

2. In cold bleak December, 
When ev’rything is drear, 
There comes across the icefields, 
A sleigh drawn by reindeer, 
Old Santa Claus springs from it, 
Down the chimney like a mouse, 
And fills up all the stockings, 
That are hung about the house.

3. He stuffs a great big apple, 
Right down into each toe,  
But how the old chap does it, 
I really do not know, 
He packs the heel with popcorn, 
With figs and sugar plums, 
And covers up the outside, 
With dolls, and sleds, and drums.

4. And yet I’ve heard it whispered, 
That stockings old and worn, 
Are often limp and empty, 
On merry Christmas morn, 
So let us pray the Christ-child, 
That Christmas day next year, 
May find those ragged stockings, 
All filled with Christmas cheer.
