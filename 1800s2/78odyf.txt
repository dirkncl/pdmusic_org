1. When I gang awa', laddie [_lassie_],
When I gang far awa',
Oh, dinna ye forget, laddie [_lassie_],
Her [_Him_] who lo'es ye mair than a'.
For her [_his_] heart's thine ain, laddie [_lassie_],
And ye know it fond and true.
And how sair would grieve your lassis [_lassie_],
If ye could na lo' her [_him_] too.

2. Lan wi' be the days, laddie [_lassie_],
Lang the hours to me,
And I know I shall grieve, laddie [_lassie_],
Thy dear loving face to see,
But in gude time, laddie [_lassie_],
We shall meet yet again,
And if not on earth, laddie [_lassie_],
May we meet above in Heav'n.
Then when I gang awa', laddie [_lassie_],
When I gang far awa',
Oh, dinna ye forget, laddie [_lassie_],
Her [_Him_] who lo'se ye mair than a'.
