1. O, comrade, we mourn for thee,
Flows the silent tear,
And oft, ’mid scenes of mirth and joy,
We’ll miss thee, comrade dear!
For thou wert always faithful,
And thou wert kind and brave,
And lov’d ones will place sweet flow’rs
On thy quiet grave!

2. O, comrade, we’ll think of thee,
As the years go by,
With love and sweetest memory,
With tearful, glist’ning eye!
For thee the work is ended,
The storms of life are o’er;
Farewell, comrade kind and true,
Rest for evermore!
