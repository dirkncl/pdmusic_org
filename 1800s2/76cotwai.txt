1. The wrestlers may brag of their muscle,
And pugilists challenge with talk,
I’ll give all these fellows a tussle,
For I am the Cock of the walk.
Then young fellows let me advise you,
My pathway never to block,
I’ll move you so quick t’will surprise you,
For I am the Cock of the walk.

[Refrain sung after each verse.]
Cock a doodle do
I’m the Cock of the walk,
Cock a doodle do
I’m the Cock of the walk.

2. Whenever I meet any Ladies,
I greet them with never a balk,
Then under the trees where the shade is,
I tell them I’m Cock of the walk.
And then if they have fine complexions,
All fair and not powder’d with chalk,
I’ll give the sweet dears full directions,
To kiss me the Cock of the walk.

3. Whenever I see by their glances,
I’ve given their hearts a love shock,
I leave them for other romances,
To suit me the Cock of the walk.
And then I can drink any liquor,
Beer Porter Champagne or good hock,
I’ll get tight and sober off quicker,
Than any but Cock of the walk.

[ENCORE VERSES 4-6]
4. If any gent thinks he’s a singer,
And dares in my presence to squawk,
I’ll squeeze his nect thro’ a clothes wringer,
For insulting the Cock of the walk.
If dancing you want why my figure,
Is from terpsichorean stock,
In a jig or a break down no nigger,
Can equal the Cock of the walk.

5. I’m bully too on declamation,
My rostrum a tree or a rock,
I can out talk the whole yankee nation,
For I am the Cock of the walk.
If any man question my beauty,
I’ll wither the insolent gawk,
And have the pleasure and duty,
To tell him I’m Cock of the walk.

6. I’m also a very good Lawyer,
With a witness I’m sharp as a hawk,
But a woman I’ll never annoy her,
For I am the Cock of the walk.
I can sometimes be a crack preacher,
And drill a large feminine flock,
Im improving each form and each feature,
For I am the Cock of the walk.
