1. She linger’d there, her beau beside her. 
They waited for the coming train; 
From a “Pullman” window I espied her; 
We stopped to soon move on again. 
But, Oh, how loving were her glances, 
Her fare so pretty and so pert! 
She woke my heart to sweetest fancies, 
This pretty girl of Roncevert! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
A bright Oasis ever beaming, 
This sweet coquesttish charming flirt; 
As sparkling as the fountain’s gleaming— 
This pretty girl of Ronvevert!

2. She caught my eye, enough the glory! 
I looked at her enhanced and dazed; 
I blushed— she blushed, make short the story, 
My heart was pierced while there I gazed. 
The “card” I sent she took with laughter, 
And then I tip’d the hat polite; 
We moved— she waved her white hand after 
Until our train was out of sight!
