1. Hear us, O Father,
Gracious One.
We bow before Thy throne adoring,
Thou only living God alone,
O hear, O hear us now Thy grace imploring.
Beneath Thy wing O God reposing,
No harm nor foe Thy children fear,
’Mid shadows all around us closing,
We rest in peace for Thou art near.
Hear us, O Father.

2. Hear us, O Father,
Hear our pray’r,
When ’neath the weight of sorrow bending,
Or worn by toil and pain and care,
O be, O be Thou all our steps attending.
Thy smile the whole creation brightens,
And all are gladden’d by Thy love,
Thy mercy ev’ry burden lightens,
With strength decending from above.
Hear us, O Father.
