1. Farewell to thee, Ireland, the land of our birth,
The pride and the glory, the gem of the earth;
We sail with sad hearts to a land far away,
In search of that bread that may fail if we stay;
New faces glow bright in the blaze of our fires,
And the Saxon abides in the halls of our sires.
Farewell, oh farewell to thy beautiful shore,
’Tis with tears that we bid thee farewell evermore.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Farewell, dear old Ireland, farewell evermore,
We sigh as we leave thy green fields and bright shore,
That dear little isle, ’tis the fairest on earth.
Farewell to lov’d Erin, the land of our birth.

2. We’ve courage to lead us; there’s strength in our hands,
There’s wealth to be won in far distant lands;
For us and our children are acres to spare,
And the names of our fathers forbid to despair.
There are homes in the world for the honest and free,
And republics and kingdoms to found o’er the sea.
Farewell, oh farewell to thy time honored shore,
Erin, dear Erin, farewell evermore.

3. Farewell, oh farewell! in the land where we go
Our hearts’ deep affection shall lighten our woe,
Thy manners, and customs, thy faith and thy fame,
Shall follow our footsteps and flourish the same.
Thy customs shall live in the land that we sing,
And the tales that we tell, to thy glory shall cling;
Farewell, oh farewell to thy time honored shore;
’Tis with tears that we bid thee farewell evermore.
