1. I know not when the day shall be,
I know not when our eyes may meet,
What welcom you may give to me,
Or will your words by sad or sweet;
It may not be ’till years have pass’d,
’Till eyes are dim and tresses gray,
The world is wide, but, love, at last,
Our hands, our hearts, must meet some day.

[REFRAIN sung after each VERSE]
Some day,
Some day, some day I shall meet you,
love, I know not when or how,
Love, I know not when or how;
only this, only this, this,
that once you loved me,
Only this, I love you now,
I love you now, I love you now.

2. I know not are you far or near,
Or are you dead or are you live;
I know now who the blame should bear,
Or who should plead or who forgive;
But when we meet some day, some day,
Eyes, clearer grown the truth may see,
And ev’ry cloud shall roll away
That darkens love ’twixt you and me.
