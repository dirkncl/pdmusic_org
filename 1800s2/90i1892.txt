1. I sing a patriotic song 
Of 1892. 
And you may tell me if I’m wrong 
In 1892. 
The politician seeks a berth, 
For duty, and for what it’s worth. 
Jay Gould no longer wants the earth 
In 1892!

2. The stars and stripes will be unfurl’d 
In 1892. 
They’ll be admired by all the world 
In 1892. 
It’s only fair as you’re aware, 
Chicago should hear the great World’s Fair, 
No matter where, we’ll all be there 
In 1892!

3. The bathers will be out in force
In 1892.
The sea will still be there of course,
In 1892.
The ladies’ costumes seem to me
Each year to shorten one degree,
For mercy’s sake! what will the be
In 1892?

4. Another President we’ll see
In 1892.
Unless we have a monarchee
In 1892.
To show what Yankee grit can de
We’ll capture Mexico, Peru,
And Canada, and Europe too
In 1892.

5. A revolution will be seen
In 1892.
In ladies’s dress, of course, I mean
In 1892.
No hustles will annoy the men,
One girl won’t take the room of ten,
In street cars there’ll be comfort then,
In 1892. 

6. If Edison is still alive
In 1892.
Electric horses we shall drive
In 1892.
Electric dinners we shall eat,
Electric brooms will clean the street,
Police will have electric feet
In 1892.

7. Will marriage be a failure then
In 1892?
That’s what I’d like to ask the men
In 1892.
Although my wife and I are one
To pay her bills is hardly fun,
And then I haven’t counted on—
In 1892.

8. The juries will be thick as bees
In 1892.
And verdicts will be found with ease
In 1892.
There’s one exception, pardon me,
Chicago juries will agree
Well, let us say in '93
But not in '92!

9. Our present Statesmen hope in vain
For 1892.
For muscle takes the place of brain
In 1892.
The fistic art will turn the tide,
In Congree we shall see with pride
John L. and Kilrain side by side
In 1892!

10. They ask me if I’m going to roar
Till 1892!
They say they’ll have me fired before
The year of '92.
I stifle my desire to sob,
And yet my heart begins to throb,
For I might not get another job
Till 1892!
