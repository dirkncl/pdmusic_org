1.
Yes, grandfather's clock, it is still standing there,
On the floor where it stood many years,
Oh, it never grows old, and its face bright and fair
Is unshadowed by sorrow or tears;
'Tis a relic of days that have gone from our gaze,
And we cherish it now with fond pride;
Tho' it stopped short ne'er to run again,
Since grandfather died.

CHORUS
Many years has it slumbered, no tick, tick, tick,
Life's seconds unnumbered, no tick, tick, tick,
For it stopped short ne'er to run again,
Since grandfather died.

2.
We look at it now and we almost can see,
Poor old grandfather lingering there,
Where he oft loved to sit near the old clock to be
In the ease of the old rocking chair,
Keeping time with his feet to its musical beat,
As he gazed in its bright face with pride,
But it stopped short ne'er to run again,
Since grandfather died.

3.
It brings back the days that have faded and gone,
And the hearts that were happy and gay,
It woke us at the earliest break of the dawn,
While it rang us to sleep with its lay;
Oh, it seemed something grand as in youth we would stand
In our wonderment there by its side,
But it stopped short ne'er to run again,
Since grandfather died.

4.
Yes, grandfather's clock, it is silent and still,
It is useless for us as it stands,
But it's part of the old home, and we never will
Let the old clock go out of our hands,
For the good it has done, for the mem'ry of one
Who has gone, we will keep it with pride,
Tho' it stopped short ne'er to run again,
Since grandfather died.
