1. We sat down in de banguet hall
  At Rasper's birthday party
And dars was food enough for all
  At Rasper's birthday party.
We took de cabbage from de pot
  At Rasper's birthday party
And served de possum smoking hot
  At Rasper's birthday party.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
At Rasper's birthday party in de evening
So happily we passed de time a way
At Rasper's birthday party in de evening
We shook de hoof until de break of day.

2. Old Daddy carved de possum well
  At Rasper's birthday party
And cousin Jake he cut a swell
  At Rasper's birthday party
And dashing Miss Jemima too
  At Rasper's birth day party
And wid 'em dar was pretty Sue
  At Rasper's birthday party.

3. Oh Jake down on a hornet sot
  At Rasper's birthday party
He found de mustard mighty hot
  At Rasper's birthday party
And some one changed Jemima's plate
  At Rasper's birthday party
Which put her in an awful state
  At Rasper's birthday party.
