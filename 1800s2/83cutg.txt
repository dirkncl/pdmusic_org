1. I am going to leave this sinful world,
I’m going far away,
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow,
I am gwine to keep an inching
If it takes till judgement day,
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.
Oh, my Bretheren and Sisters,
Come and join our little band,
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.
The way is dark and dreary,
But we travel hand in hand,
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh Bretheren, come along,
Oh Sisters, come along,
Classleaders, come along,
And we’ll climb to the moon so high.

2. You had better stop your worldly ways,
And turn your back on sin;
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow,
For the good book tells us,
It is never too late to begin;
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.
Fill your gospel lamps with oil,
Take your golden harps along;
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.
As we’re marching thro’ the valley,
We will sing this good old song,
  Climbing up to glory mighty slow.
