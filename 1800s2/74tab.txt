1.
Far, away down South in Alabama,
Where the darkies plant the cotton and the corn,
In that land where blooms the sweet magnolias
In that paradise us darkies we were born;
Old Massa he was kind, and little Missus too,
They'd be amus'd to see us jump and dance,
Oh! they called us Alabama Blossoms,
And we're going back whene'er we get a chance.

CHORUS
Oh! Massa he was kind, and Little Missus too,
They'd be amused to see us jump and dance;
Oh! they called us Alabama Blossoms,
And we're going back whene'er we got a chance.

2.
Oh! the sweet girls down in Alabama,
We are longing ev'ry day once more to see,
And there's one that says I am her darling,
And I know that she is all the world to me;
Oh! when she said goodbye, it made this darkey cry,
My heart was full of ev'ry kind of pain,
But I'm going back to Jane Matilda,
For I want to see her lovely face again.

(CHORUS)

3.
We have been far from old Alabama,
But there is no place that we love half so well,
And our secret now at last we've told you,
But our love affairs we didn't mean to tell;
We know that far away, ther're waiting ev'ry day,
To see us coming smiling up the lane,
And we'll go back to the land of Cotton,
And we'll never leave the dear old place again.

(CHORUS)
