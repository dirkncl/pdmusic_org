1. Our father’s God! from out whose hand 
The centuries fall like grains of sand, 
We meet today, united, free, 
And loyal to our land and Thee, 
To thank Thee for the era done, 
And trust Thee for the opening one.

2. Here where of old, by Thy design, 
The fathers spake that word of Thine 
Whose echo is the glad refrain 
Of rended bolt and falling chain, 
To grace our fental time from all 
The zones of earth our guests we call.

3. Be with us while the New World greets 
The Old World, thronging all its streets, 
Unveiling all the triumphs won 
By art or toil beneath the sun; 
And unto common good ordain 
This rivalship of hand and brain.

4. Thou who hast here in concord furled 
The warflags of a gathered world, 
Beneath our western skies fulfil 
The Orient’s mission of good will, 
And freighted with Love’s golden fleece, 
Send back the Argonauts of peace.

5. For art and labor met in truce, 
For beauty made the bride of use, 
We thank thee, while with all we crave 
The austere virtues strong to save, 
The honor proof to place or gold, 
The manhood never bought or sold!

6. Oh make thou us, through centuries long, 
In peace secure, and justice strong; 
Around our gift of freedom draw 
The safeguards of Thy rightous law, 
And cast in some diviner mould, 
Let the new cycle shame the old.
