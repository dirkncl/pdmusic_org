1. The maiden sits on mountain high,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
Her cattle all are standing by,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
The air is calm, the world is still,
And all is tranquil on the hill,
The breeze is hushed and hushed the stream,
The maiden site as in a dream,
Untill with voice so strong and clear,
She sends this song, all the vale to cheer,

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
dulie du duli ulie ha ha dulie
du duli ulie ha ha dulie
du duli ulie ha ha dulie du dulie dulie
dulie dulie du duli ulie ha ha duli
ulie du duli ulie ha ha duli
ule du duli dulie ha ha dulie ha ha ha.

2. The baby cries, Oh my! how shrill,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
It cries and it will not be still,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
The mother hears its helpless cry,
And she to smoothe it she doth try,
But all in vain, it will not cease,
And naught will give it quiet peace,
Untill the mother comfort brings,
And thus a sweet, tender yodel sings,

3. The parson he is old and grave,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
He knows the way all sould to save,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
He is not any of that sort,
Who join in ev’ry kind of sport,
He makes us think about your end,
And tries to be a solemn friend,
But when we sing our yodel through,
The parson feels, he must join in too,

4. Old Marg’ry loves to preach and pray,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
And think back when the world was gay,
dulie dulie dulie dulie.
She speaks with pleasure, loud and fast,
About the good old days now past,
Ah me! those days are long since gone,
And now she lingers here alone,
And then her sadness melts away,
And she too, joins in the old, old lay,
