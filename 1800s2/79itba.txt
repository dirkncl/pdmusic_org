1.
I'm a trab'ling back again,
Couldn't stay away no mo';
Want to hear my children sing,
Like dey sung in days of afore.
I'm a comin!
Yes, a comin!
Keep a watchin' by de window;
Keep a listt'nin', fo' you will hear me,
I'm a trab'lin' back again!

[If used as minstrel act, let quartette be sung
behind scenes, using words in parenthesis(-).
In such case, the old man remains silent, listening.]
CHORUS 1 and 2
Oh yes, I (he) am (is) comin' back dis way;
Yes, my (dear) honey an' I'm (he's) gwine to stay!
I (He) will meet you, honey, some bright day,
For I'm (he's) trab'ling back again, back again.

2.
I'm  trab'ling to my home,
I'se now right on my way.

They are runing out to see us,
Oh I see them they are a comin'
They are comin' out to me!

I'm a comin home again,
Gwine to set right down for to stay,
Ain't a had no rest, my dear,
Since de time I went away!

Glad to meet you, chil'en, dis bright day,
For de ole man's home again, home again.
