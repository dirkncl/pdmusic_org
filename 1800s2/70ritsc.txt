"Ridin' in the Street Cars" (1870)
by Fred. Wilson
from "Fred. Wilson's Songs", No. 3

1.
A riding in the cars,
On a wet and muddy day,
A long with Pa and Ma,
You've fifteen cents to pay,
You sit down side by side,
On seats so well arranged,
And fumble through your pockers
for the necessary change.

CHORUS
Ring the bell,
Crack the whip,
Now we go hurrah,
Don't we have a jolly time,
A riding in the car.
Oh' Ring the bell,
Crack the whip,
Now we go hurrah,
Don't we have a jolly time,
A riding in the car.


2.
Now if the car is full,
And a lady wants a seat,
You kindly give your own,
And stand upon your feet.
She takes it with a frown,
Which gives your nerves a jar,
And makes you hate the city crowd,
that's riding in the car.

(CHORUS)

3.
A man stands at the door,
Who is not at all polite,
He's had too much to drink,
And smokes a dirty pipe.
You ask him for to move,
And kindly give you place,
Instead of moving he will puff
tobacco in your face.

(CHORUS)
