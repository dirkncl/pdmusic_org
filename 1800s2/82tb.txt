Come while the band is playing
Come while the hounds are beying
Ev'ry heart will be joyful
When the band begins to play,
(And our hearts are now)
Bounding our hearts with gladness,
Driving away all sadness.
Oh for the band
Hurrah for the band.

Now the band we hear it fills the heart
with hopes and cheer.
Trumpets echo clear
Their welcome blast with joy we hear
Come while the band is playing,
come while the hounds are beying
Every heart will be joyful
when the band begins to play.
(And our hearts are now)
Bounding our hearts with gladness.
Driving away all sadness,
Oh! for the band.
Hurrah for the band.

Sweet music now we hear
It fills our hearts with love and cheer
Oh what can be more grand
Than music from the noble band
The band the band.

Now the band we hear
It fills the heart with hope and cheer
Trumpets echo clear
Their welcome blast, with joy we hear.
The band the band the band
The band.
