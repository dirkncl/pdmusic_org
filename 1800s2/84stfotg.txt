1. It’s many long years since our late civil war.
We sometimes look back on the past, 
To those dark gloomy days the clash of arms 
Will live while the Union shall last.
But out dear old flag still waves in the breeze 
And ever a people most true.
And sometimes we’ll think of the noble hours 
Those Heroes that once wore the Blue.

CNORUS [sung after each VERSE]
As you gather the flowers to deck the one graves 
of our soldiers the tried and the true 
Then scatter the flowers over the Gray 
And scater them over the Blue.

2. Now dark were the days for many a year.
We stood by that old flag of yore.
The flag that our fathers yet in our hand 
Had now been insulted once more.
By our own kindred that lived in the South 
Old Slav’ry was gasping adieu.
The South with the Grey lost thousands they say 
And we lost our thousands of Blue.

3. As back on the past we now take a look
We see the great cause of our crime
A people in bondage groaning in tears
We breathing the great law of time
A nation that’s guilty, must struggle in blood
And lose its thousands of true
Of those dear loving ones the North and the South
With their Gray and also of Blue.

4. Let us plant roses over the Gray
They had a dark duty to do
And altho’ it was wrong, they thought it a right
And fought our brave boys there in Blue
The great law of love will some day unite
And make us a people most true
Then scatter a flower over the Gray
And scatter them over the Blue.
