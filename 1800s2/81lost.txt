1. He kiss’d my cheek and said goodbye 
As he sail’d for the Southern sea. 
And the white wing’d bark sped fast away 
And has never come back to me. 
The sailors sail in and the sailors sail out. 
The ships sail to and fro. 
And my eyes are dim with watching for him 
Who sail’d in the long ago. 

2. His heart was brave and mine was sad 
As he walk’d by the moonlit shore. 
And I promised to wait and watch for him. 
And I’m waiting for evermore. 
The sailors sail out and the sailors return. 
The ships sail to and fro. 
And I watch again and I wait in vain 
For the barque of long ago. 

3. The white sea gulls fly far and near. 
But they never bring word to me. 
And the breese brings other ships to port 
But sever a ship to me. 
Oh! The winds blow safe and the winds blow strong 
And the white caps come and go. 
But never in tears thro’ long sad years 
I’ve watch’d for the long ago.
