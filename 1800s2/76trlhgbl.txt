1. No more will the storm beat around him, 
That father so feeble and old; 
For angels, bright angels have found him, 
And o’er him their pinions they fold. 
Forsaken by those he protected, 
And thrown on this harse world to die; 
Alone and despised and neglected, 
No more will he sorrow and sigh.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Oh, softly he murmur’d forgiveness, 
And bow'd his gray head on his breast; 
They’re bringing him back from the poorhouse, 
To yander fair mansions of rest.

2. Once bright was the future before him, 
With home and fair children so dear; 
But clouds of misfortune came o’er him, 
And no one to help him came near. 
His pleadings and sorrows unheeded, 
Out into the streets he was cast; 
And e’en by his children asshielded, 
Heart-broken he perish’d at last.

3. For him there was no sweet caressing, 
For him there was no gentle tear; 
Yet fondly he pray’d for a blessing   
On those who had wrong’d him so here. 
Though none o’er his pillow are weeping, 
Though rude is the grave they have made; 
God love’s hom so peacefully sleeping, 
To rest let him gently be laid.
