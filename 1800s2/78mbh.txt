1. Dan McCarthy lives in Cherry street,
  McCarthy’s boarding house;
He keeps a boarding house so neat,
  McCarthy’s boarding house;
Five dollars a week to him we pay,
  McCarthy’s boarding house.
We get these square meals ev’ry day,
  McCarthy’s boarding house.

CHORUS 1
Johanna, alanny,
Loves Nailor, the Tailor,
And faith they’ll be married,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.
Johanna, alanny,
Loves Nailor, the Tailor,
And faith they’ll be married,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.

2. I tell you, boys, they feed us high,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house,
On lobster salad and lemon pie,
  In McCarthy’s boading house.
Quail on toast, eggs and ham,
  McCarthy’s boarding house,
Corned beef and cabbage and Italian jam,
  McCarthy’s boarding house.

CHORUS 2
There’s the Clearys, and Learys,
And McLious, and Flynns,
Denny, the Regans, and the Fagins,
  McCarthy’s boarding house,
There’s the Clearys, and Learys,
And McLions, and Flynns,
Denny, the Regans, and the Fagins,
  McCarthy’s boarding house.

3. McCarthy bought a new piano,
  For McCarthy’s boarding house,
For his elegant daughter, big Johanna,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.
And she’s the girl knows how to play,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house,
She’d drive your appetite away,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.

CHORUS 3
There is cobblers and nailers
Tailors and weavers,
Tiny butchers and bakers,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.
There is a cobblers and nailers
Tailors and weavers,
Tiny butchers and bakers,
  In McCarthy’s boarding house.
