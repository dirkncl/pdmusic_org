1.
A wonderful musician once,
  In Germany did dwell,
His name quite unpronounceable,
  Impossible to spell.
He could play on any instrument,
  No matter great or small,
This wonderful musician,
  He could play upon them all.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
A big drum, a kettledru, the fiddle, flute and piccolo,
Piano, harp, harmonium and many more beside,
A french horn, a sax horn, a trombone and double bass,
Bones, banjo, tambourine, bassoon and ophicleide.

2.
He only had a little room
  Upon the second floor,
And very little room indeed
  He had you may be sure;
He had no chairs or table,
  No sofa and no bed,
He said he didn’t want em
  For of course he had instead.

3.
The neighbours used to grumble
  For he would make such a din,
At day break every morning
  To practice he’d begin;
And sometimes from their slumbers
  They’d awake in such a fright,
For often he’d be playing
  In the middle of the nught.

4.
One night there was a fearful noise.
  They heard it far and near,
Many thought it was an earthquake
  And many quaked in fear;
Every body thought of course
  Something shocking had occur’d,
They all stood shaking in the street
  And then distinctly heard.

5.
Of course they very soon found out
  The cause of all the riot,
They heard another dreadful crash
  Then every thing was quiet;
They found the old musician
  Had blown all his breath away,
In trying if he all at once
  His instruments could play.
