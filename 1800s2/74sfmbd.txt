1. Come and lift me from my pillow
Weak and weary I have grown;
Darling sister, I am going
O’er the river dark and lone!
All my pray’rs I’ve softly whispered;
Weep no longer, sister dear:
Send for mother, Birdie’s dying,
Angel voices now I hear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Fold me closer, darling sister,
Earth is fading from my sight;
Send for mother, Birdie’s dying,
Kiss me, kiss me sweet goodnight!

2. Keep my mem’ry dear, fond sister,
Don’t forget me far away;
Nevermore we’ll play together
All the rosy summer day.
I’ll be waiting for you yonder,
Till we sweetly meet again:
Send for mother, Birdie’s dying,
I would see her once again!

3. Let them lay me where the daisies
In the springtime love to grow;
All around me throng the angels,
There are calling, I must go!
Clasp me fondly, kiss me sweetly,
Darling sister, do not cry;
Send for mother, Birdie’s dying,
Let me bid her sweet goodbye.
