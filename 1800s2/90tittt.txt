[Alvin.]
1.
Johnnie came to my house, I wasn’t at home,
I went to Johnnie’s and took a marrow bone,
Took a marrow bone and dug it out clean;
Wasn’t it jolly and serene?
[Si.]
Turkeys in the treetop,
Can’t get ’em down,
Dine on codfish all around the town,
For their heads are level,
And they don’t fret,
And they’ll stay there cold or wet.

[DUET]
Thanksgiving day, we’re blithe and gay;
Come join the play Thanksgiving day,
Thanksgiving day, we’re blithe and gay;
Come join the play Thanksgiving day.

[Alvin.]
2.
Johnnie bring the banjo, make it just talk,
I’ll do a walk around while the children squawk;
Such a Thanksgiving day never was seen;
Wasn’t it jolly and serene?
[Si.]
Children don’t you hear me,
Stick to your play,
Drink cold water
feel so bright and gay.
Men again are young boys,
When they have met,
Gay and happy each old vet.
