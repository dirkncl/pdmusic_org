1. A little Cottage by the stream,
Tall maples shadowing o'er
A maiden lost in love's sweet dream,
Is sitting by the door,
So earnestly she looks above,
And out o're the ocean blue
You'd know she waits an absent love
And ah, she knows it too;
You'd know she waits an absent love
And ah, she knows it too,

While siting there so lonely,
Sweet mem'ries fondly throng.
And low and softly she sings to him,
Her tender heart-born song.

"Come oh my darling, still loving I wait,
Wistfully watching, to see thee at the gate,
Long have I waited and watched here in vain,
Still, hope tells me you are coming again."

2. 'Twas just one year ago today,
He kissed his last "Goodbye,"
Then sailed across the ocean spray,
And left her home to sigh,
She trusted him to Heaven's kind care,
And said he would return, she knew,
So still she sings "I'll never despair,
And ah, he knows it too;"
So still she sings "I'll never despair,
And ah, he knows it too,"

No tidings of his good ship have come,
Her heart is filled with fears.
But she with love and faith most strong,
Still watches and sings thro' tears.

"Come, oh my darling, still sadly I wait,
Wistfully watching, to see thee at the gate,
Long have I waited and watched here in vain,
Still, hope tells me you are coming again."

3. As low she sings, her warm tears rain,
Her song sinks o'er the sea,
And ah, a voice resumes the strain,
Her heart cries, "Yes, 'tis he"
Her darling, she doth soon behold,
And he his "little angel" too;
Then whispering low that story old,
He said "Love, I am true;"
Then whispering low that story old,
He said "Love, I am true,"

No longer sitting lonely,
Sweet mem'ries fondly throng.
As low and softly she sings to him,
Her tender heart-born song.

"Rest, oh my darling, for here is your home,
Sad has my heart been, while watching all alone,
Rest, oh my darling, and dream of the sea,
But leave me not dear my world is in thee."
