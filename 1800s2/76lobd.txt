1. Lullaby, O baby dear, 
Let thy lovely eyelids close, 
While I clasp thee, garner’d here, 
Float, my sweet one, to repose. 
Do not ope thy little eye. 
Lullaby, love, lullaby! 
On thy dreaming pinions fly, 
While I sing thy Lullaby! 

2. Lord, who with such tender care, 
Givest Thy beloved sleep, 
Givest us the bliss to share 
In the watch Thine Angels keep; 
Sleeping, waking we are Thine, 
Thou dost soothe us when we cry, 
For His sake, who, Babe Divine, 
Lov’d a human Lullaby. 

3. Slubber on, O baby dear, 
Guardian Angels thee caress; 
May the sweetest dreams be thine, 
With God’s love to always bless. 
Mother more content than I, 
Never sang a Lullaby. 
Softly yet in slumber lie, 
While I sing thy lullaby. 

[CODA]
Sleep on, sleep well, sleep on, my love, 
O do not ope thy little eye. 
Sleep on, my child, 
Sleep on, my love.
