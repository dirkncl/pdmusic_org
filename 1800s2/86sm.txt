1.
Hungry and weary,
No one to greet
Turned from her own door,
Thrown on the street,
No one says mother,
No loving hands
Hold hers in friendship,
alone there she stands.
How oft she's thought of children so dear,
Nobody knows her
Nobody cares,
Simply a wand'rer with silvery hair.
But she's

CHORUS
Somebody's mother
Oh God bless her soul,
That's standing alone there so hungry and cold,
Never, oh, nevermore will I roam,
But protect her ever, 'till God calls her home.

2.
Soon as I saw her wild
piteous face
With heart most broken
Then did I trace,
She was my mother
Grown old and gray,
When I had left in
my boy's early day,
Closely I clasp'd her poor trembling form,
Cheer mother darling,
You're not along,
Kiss mother darling, and no more I'll roam.
Now she's

CHORUS
Somebody's mother
Oh God bless her soul,
No more will she stand there so hungry and cold,
Never, oh, never stand ther more will I roam,
But protect her ever, 'till God calls her home.
