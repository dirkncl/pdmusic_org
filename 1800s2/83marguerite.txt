1. Marguerite! Marguerite! My star of hope. 
I dread the day, you’ll forget me Marguerite 
And still I know it soon will come, 
The festive dance, the rich, the gay, 
So diff’rent from our home, Marguerite, 
I would not chide thee, 
Chide thee Marguerite, 
Nor mar one joy of thine so sweet 
But oh, I dread that dreary day, 
You’ll me forget, Marguerite, 
But oh, I dread that dreary day, 
You’ll me forget, Marguerite. 

2. I wander’d down by the little babbling brook, 
Its ev’ry ripple speaks of thee 
The roses too, they droop their heads, 
In sympathy with me, Marguerite. 
If this bright world, 
It were all of mine to give, 
I’d proudly lay it at thy feet, 
But oh the thought you’ll not be mine 
Will break my heart, Marguerite, 
But oh the thought you’ll not be mine 
Will break my heart, Marguerite, Marguerite.
