1. In beauty’s bow’r for e’er there dwells,
A maiden passing fair,
She shines more pure than beauty’s Queen,
And grace sits in each air,
Here breath more pure than morning’s breeze,
O’er Violets wet with dew,
Her teeth like pearls from Orient seas,
Her lips of coral hue.

2. Brilliant and large and dark her eye,
Now lightning’s flash it throws;
Anon with soul expressive sigh,
With love’s soft glance it glows:
Alas! for those who stray within,
The circle of that eye;
For serpent like it shall but win;
Its victim, e’er he die.

3. Then venture not withing that bow’r
Where glance those fickle eyes;
Shun the Coquette’s too fatal pow’r,
Or reap thy store of sighs;
For tho’ that girl is passing fair,
And winning is her way;
Her love is e’en as stairs of sand,
Alas more false than they.
