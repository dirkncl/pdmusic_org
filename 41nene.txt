1. New England, New England, my home o’er the sea, 
My heart, as I wander, turns fondly to thee; 
For brightrests the sun on thy clear winding streams, 
And soft o’er thy meadows the moon pours her beams. 
New England, New England my home o’er the sea, 
The wanderer’s heart turns in fondness to thee. 

2. Thy breezes are beatiful, and clear are thy rills, 
And the harvest waves proudly and rich on thy hills; 
Thy maidens are fair, and the yeomen are strong, 
And thy rivers run blithly thy vallies among. 
New England, New England my home o’er the sea, 
The wanderer’s heart turn in fondness to thee.

3. There’s home in New England where dear ones of mine 
Are thinking of me and the days of “Auld land syne;” 
And blest be the hour when my pilgrimage o’er, 
I shall sit by the hearthstone  and leave it no more. 
New England, New England my home o’er the sea. 
My heart as I wander turns fondly to thee.
