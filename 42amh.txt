My native land I love thee well,
  There’s none so dear to me;
In thy sweet vales I love to dwell—
  Blest land of liberty!
I  love Columbia’s tranquil shore,
  Her hills I love to roam,
That glorious land, which I adore—
  America, my home!
[REFRAIN]
That glorious land, which I adore—
  America, my home!

Old-England has her beauties rare,
  And palaces we see!
But royal pomp, tho’ bright and fair,
  I leave, and come to thee!
Then bear me to that happy shore,
  My barque, o’er ocean’s foam;
I long to tread thy soil once more—
  America, my home!
[REFRAIN]
I long to tread thy soil once more—
  America, my home!
