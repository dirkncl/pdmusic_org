1.
Here under the leafy greenwood tree
I pass the moontide hour
And happier far am I than he
Who seeks but the courtly bow'r
For near me grows the wild white rose.
A bright sky beams above!
And upward springs the lark who sings
The truest notes of love.

[REFRAIN]
Here under the leafy greenwood tree
I pass the moontide hour
And happier far am I than he
Who seeks but the courtly bow'r
Hither! quickly hasten to me!
Under the leafy greenwood tree.

2.
The butterfly sports his golden wing.
A singing stream runs by.
And many a bird that hail'd the Spring,
Still greeteth the summer sky.
For painted halls, and parlore walls
I care not, whilst for me,
Dear Nature yields her smiling fields,
And the shade of a greenwood tree.
