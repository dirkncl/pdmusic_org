"The Gypsy Girl's Dream; or,
I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls" (1843)
(from the Opera "The Bohemian Girl")
Words by Alfred Bunn, Esq.
Music by Michael William Balfe, 1808-1870

1.
I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
With vassels and serfs at my side,
And of all who assembled within those walls
That I was the hope and the pride.
I had riches too great to count, could boast
Of a high ancestral name.
But I also dreamt, which pleas'd me most
That you loved me still the same,
that you loved me, you loved me still the same,
That you loved me, you loved me still the same

2.
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand;
That knights, upon bended knee.
And with vows no maiden heart could withstand,
They pledged their faith to me.
And I dreamt that one of that noble host,
Came forth my hand to claim;
But I also dreamt, which charm'd me most,
That you loved me still the same.
That you loved me, you loved me still the same,
That you loved me, you loved me still the same.
