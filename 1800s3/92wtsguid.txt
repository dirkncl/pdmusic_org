1. A sailor boy stood on the shore 
And watch’d the waves roll high. 
He thought of her he lov’d so well 
And tears stood in his eyes 
For she had cross’d the ocean deep 
And left him there alone. 
Little he knows she lies asleep 
Yes, safe on God’s bright throne.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Still he watches and waits for her, 
Patiently on the shore. 
His heart with anguish cries aloud, 
Shall I never see her more. 
Silently drift the big black clouds. 
She lies on ocean’s bed. 
Shall I see her he cries aloud, 
“When the sea give up its dead.” 
Shall I see her he cries aloud, 
“When the sea gives up its dead.”

2. A message came to him one day 
And of the fair young girl, 
The steamer that was on its way 
Against the rocks was hurled. 
Oh God! she cried, as she went down 
And sank in ocean’s bed. 
He shall meet her again on high, 
When the sea gives up its dead.
