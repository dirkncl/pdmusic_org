1. There's an old kitchen clock on the shelf near the door,
That has been there since I was born.
It has ticked off a story of a life full of care,
All the day thro' the night and morn.
It was placed there by mother who now is gone,
And father use to wind it every night.
The children went to school at the stroke of its chime,
And it made the old home cheerful and bright.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The old kitchen clock with its tick tick tick,
As it stood on the shelf near the door.
It's as dear now to me as the child on my knee,
And I'll love it forevermore.

2. It awoke me in the morn at the early hour of six
And it gathered all the folks for lunch at noon.
It timed the golden sunset in the far far west
And it told us of our bedtime too soon.
When mother passed away it struck its last.
It seemed that its usefullness was o'er.
We all miss the tick of the old kitchen clock
That stood upon the shelf near the door.
