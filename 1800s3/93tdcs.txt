1.
Close your eyes, my "Honey," and we'll ride away,
And travel off to dreamland where the "Brownies" play.
We'll fly thro' the meadows and over the streams,
And over the mountains in the land of dreams.
The black clouds will hide us, the glowworms will guide us,
And fairies will keep us from going astray,
The night shades are falling,
The fairies are calling,
So close your eyes, my "Honey," and we'll ride away.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Sleep, "Honey," sleep, night is falling,
Fairies from dreamland are calling,
Slumber, my sweet,
Sleep, "Honey," sleep,
You, sleep, my bird, and dream sweet dreams.

2.
Hush, my "piccaninny," 'tis the sweet night breeze
Playing thro' the branches of the yielding trees.
So rest thee, my darling, there's nothing to fear,
The fairies will guard thee, and I'll linger near.
The bright stars are gleaming, the young moon is beaming,
And bathing the woodland with soft mellow light,
'Tis time you were dreaming,
For dreamland is teeming
With "Brownies" and with "Fairies" to greet thee tonight.
