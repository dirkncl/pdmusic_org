1. 
De silv’ry moon am shining bright,
Hush my birdie, hush my baby,
Shut yo’ eyes my heart’s delight,
Hush my little coon.
Res’ dem little weary feet,
Hush my birdie, hush my baby,
Rag man’s coming down de street,
Hush my little coon;
Shut yo’ eyes my curly headed little pickanninny.
While de nightengale am singing, in de orange grove,
When de robbin twitters in de cornfield at de daybreak,
Run and wake yo’ mammy, my little black faced love.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hush my love, my baby, my honey,
Hush my love, my baby, my honey,
Shut yo’ eyes my sweet pickanninny,
Hush my little coon.

2. 
Now rest dat little weary brain,
Hush my birdie, hush my baby,
Bye bye white man came again,
Hush my little coon,
Bramberville aint far away,
Hush my birdie, hush my baby,
Brownies live dare so dey say.
Hush my little coon;
Close beside her pickanninny’s cradle mammy’s sitting,
Watching o’er her baby love, her little octoroon,
Weary from de toiling la de field among de cotton,
Shut yo’ eyes my baby, oh hush my little coon.
