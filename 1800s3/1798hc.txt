1.
Hail Columbia happy land!
Hail, ye heroes heav'n born band,
Who fought and bled in freedom's cause,
Who fought and bled in freedom's cause,
And when the storm of war was gone,
Enjoyed the peace your valor won.
Let Independence be your boast,
Ever mindful what it cost;
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its altar reach the skies.

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Firm, united let us be,
Rallying round our Liberty!
As a hand of brothers join'd,
Peace and safety we shall find.

2.
Immortal Patriots! rise once more!
Defend your rights, defend your shore;
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Let no rude foe with impious hand
Invade the shrine where sacred lies
Of toil and blood, the well earn'd prize,
Whill offering peace sincere and just
In heav'n we place a manly trust,
That truth and justice may prevail,
And every scheme of bondage fail.

3.
Sound, sound the trump of fame,
Let Washington's great name
Ring thro' the world with loud applause!
Ring thro' the world with loud applause!
Let every clime, to freedom dear,
Listen with a joyful ear;
With equal skill, with steady power,
He governs in the fearful hour
Of horrid war, or guides with ease,
The happier time of honest peace.

4.
Behold the chief, who now commands,
Once more to serve his country, stands,
The rock on which the storm will beat!
The rock on which the storm will beat!
But armed in virtue, firm and true,
His hopes are fixed on heav'n and you;
When hope was winking in dismay,
When gloom obscur'd Columbia's day;
His steady mind from changes free
resolved on death or Liberty.
