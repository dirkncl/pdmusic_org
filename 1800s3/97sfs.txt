1. There’s a cottage down in Georgia
In the city of Savannah,
Where a cocoa colored gal does dwell;
Her ways they are the coaxingest,
She has the cutest manner,
Her name to you I’ll tell.
She’s not like other ladies
Of the chocolate persuation,
And her style is all her own:
She’s the blackest stick of licorice
The sun has ever shone on.
And some day she’ll be my own.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
O Susanna,
From Savannah,
You’re my blackeyed angel from above;
You’se my honey,
My spendin’ money;
O Susanna, my lady love.

2. A coon named Rufus Jackson
Was trying to steal Susanna,
But his work was just a little too coarse;
For I carved up Mister Jackson
In a scandalacious manner,
Now his fam’ly mourn his loss
A procession left his domicile
A week ago today,
And in the front carriage he did ride;
And, to tell the truth, you know,
His friends behind were walking slow, for
Rufus had done gone and died.
