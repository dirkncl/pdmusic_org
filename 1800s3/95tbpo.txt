1.
Matt Casey formed a social club that beat the town for style,
And hired for a meeting place a hall
When pay day came around each week they greased the floor with wax.
And danced with noise and vigor at the ball,
Each Saturday you'd see them dressed up in Sunday clothes,
Each lad would have his sweetheart by his side.
When Casey led the first grand march they all would fall in line,
Behind the man who was they joy and pride,

CHORUS [2 times after each verse]
Casey would waltz with a strawberry blond,
And the Band played on,
He'd glide cross the floor with the girl he ador'd,
and the Band played on,
But his brain was so loaded it nearly exploded,
The poor girl would shake with alarm.
He'd ne'er leave the girl with the strawberry curls,
And the Band played on.

2.
Such kissing in the corner and such whisp'ring in the hall,
And telling tales of love behind the stairs
As Casey was the favorite and he that ran the ball.
Of kissing and lovemaking did his share,
At twelve o'clock exactly they all would fall in line,
Then march down to the dining hall and eat.
But Casey would not join them although ev'ry thing was fine,
But he stayed upstairs and exercise his feet,
For ---

3.
Now when the dance was over and the band played home sweet home,
They played a tune at Casey's own request.
He thank'd them very kindly for the favors they had shown.
Then he'd waltz once with the girl that he loved best.
Most all the friends are married that Casey used to know,
And Casey too has taken him a wife.
The blond he used to waltz and glide with on the ball room floor,
Is happy missis Casey now for life,
