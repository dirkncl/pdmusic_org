1. Fling out the nation’s stripes and stars,
  The gloriouis standard of the free.
The  banner borne in Freedom’s ware,
  The hallow’d gem of Liberty.
On mountain top, in valley deep,
  Whereever dwell the free and brave,
O’er graves where Freedom’s martyrs sleep.
  Columbia’s flag must freely wave.
    O’er graves where Freedom’s martyrs sleep.
    Columbia’s flag must freely wave.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
On mountain top, in valley deep,
Whereever dwell the free and brave,
O’er graves where Freedom’s martyrs sleep,
Columbia’s flag shall freely wave.

2. Raise high the bright auspicious flag,
  From every height and lowly glen,
In forest, dell, or jutting crag,
  Afar among the haunts of men;
The sparkling banner widely flung,
  Shall wave o’er land and sea;
And Freedom’s anthem, sweetly sung,
  Shall swell our country’s jubilee!
    And Freedom’s anthem, sweetly sung,
    Shall swell our country’s jubilee!

3. Oh! let the world that flag behold,
  The emblem of the brave and free,
The brightest crown of streaming gold,
  The decks the goddess Liberty!
Spread out its folds till Heaven’s high dome
  Reverberates the holy sound,
That all oppressed have found a home
  On Freedom’s consecrated ground.
    That all oppressed have found a home
    On Freedom’s consecrated ground.

4. Fling out our country’s banner wide;
  Our emblematic starry gem;
OUR UNION NEVER SHALL DIVIDE,
  While floats that silken diadem.
Year after year the brilliant stars
  Shall indicate the strength of all;
Let all beware of civil wars,
  That curse of monarchs— Freedom’s fall!
    Let all beware of civil wars,
    That curse of monarchs— Freedom’s fall!
