1. There was a little dog,
  Both lame and blind,
And ev’ryone to it
  Was most unkind;
At last one day a man
  Made one bad break,
He gave unto that dog
  A big beefsteak.
And the dog went mad!
  It couldn’t stand the kindness!
So the dog went mad!
  In spite of all its blindness,
For weeks it had not fed,
  With hunger was near dead,
But when a bit it had,
  The dog went mad.

2. A company, I know,
  Went out full tog,
They thought to try the show
  Upon the dog.
They seized a little cur
  To play it to,
But oh, when they begun,
  The show fell through,
For the dog went mad!
  It couldn’t stand the acting!
So the dog went mad!
  For it was too exacting.
The heroine yelled “murder.”
  The poor dog never heard her,
Altho’ ’twas awful sad.
  The dog went mad.

3. An organ grinder went
  Adown the street,
He played “After the Ball”
  To all he’d meet;
A bulldog came along
  And heard the strains,
He gave three piteous howls,
  Had swift short pains,
Then the dog went mad!
  It ne’er had heard such musick!
O! the dog went mad!
  ’Twould truly have made you sick!
Of tunes it could stand all,
  Except “After the Ball;”
But that song was so bad
  The dog went mad.

4. Some people dined one day
  On sausage meat,
And gave some sausage to
  Their dof to eat:
It put its forefeet on
  The well filled plate,
But when it took a bite—
  O! sad to state—
The dog went mad,
  Recognized its brother,
The dog went mad,
  Couldn’t eat another;
The dog was of no station,
  But loved its dead relation,
But this was far too sad,
  So the dog went mad.

5. A family went off
  To Saint Louie,
They took a little dog
  The sight to see;
They reach St. Louis town,
   But ’twas so slow.
The darling little dog
  Barked out “no go;”
Thne the dog went mad,
  St. Louis was so quiet,
The dog went mad,
  Gave the town a riot,
They had such fun each minute,
  St. Louis says “I’m in it;”
But St. Louis was so bad,
  The dog went mad.
