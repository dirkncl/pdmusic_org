1. How oft in youth, in childhood’s time 
Throughout the livelong day, 
We’ve rov’d thro’ fields and meadows green, 
With playmates young and gay; 
And when we think of those sweet hours 
Then does not mem’ry blend 
Amid those scenes remembrance of 
Some long lost Absent Friend.

2. And if we think of later days, 
Tho’ now for ever past, 
Of happy moments once so bright, 
But ah! too bright to last; 
Should we retrace those scenes alone, 
Oh! what will sooner tend, 
To make us feel how much we miss 
Some dear love’d  absent friend.

3. Or ’mid the silent hour of eve, 
When all around seems still, 
Past scenes of life our thoughts recall 
From meadow, vale or hill; 
And should we roam o’er land or sea 
Till life for ever ends, 
As thus we muse o’er days gone by, 
We think of absent friends.
