1.
Oh the old farm house down beside the valley stream,
Where in childhood so oft I have played;
Ere sorrow had clouded my heart's early dream
Of life's purest joys had decayed,
How well I remember its vine covered roof
And the rose bushes clust'ring nigh,
And the tall stately poplar trees standing aloof,
Whose tops seem'd to reach to the sky;
  Oh the old farm house my childhood's happy home.

2.
Oh the old farm house, how I've sported 'round its hearth
With my sisters and brothers so dear,
How oft has it rung with our innocent mirth;
And hallow'd our soft evening pray'r,
But the old farm house now is howing decay
Its stones like dead friends lie apart,
But its dear cherish'd image shall ne'er fade away
From affection's domain in my heart;
  Oh the old farm house my childhood's happy home.
