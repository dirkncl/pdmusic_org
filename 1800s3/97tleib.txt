1. I was standing by my window yestermorning,
With out a thought of worry or of care.
When I saw the Postman coming down the pathway,
With such a happy smile and jaunty air.
Oh he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,
And then he said, “Good-morning to you Jack;”
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me,
When he handed me a letter edged in black.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
As I heard the Postman whistling yester-morning,
Coming down the pathway with his pack,
O’ he little knew the sorrow that he brought me,
When he handed me a letter edged in black.

2. Then with trembling hands I took the letter from him,
I broke the seal and this is what it said,
“Come home my boy, your poor old Father wants you,
Come home my boy, your Mother dear is dead.”
O your Mother’s words the last she ever uttered,
Were, “Tell me boy I want him to come back!”
My eyes are blurred, my poor old heart is breaking,
While I’m writing you this letter edged in black.”

3. O I bow my head in sadness and in sorrow,
The sunlight of my life, it now has fled.
Since the Postman brought that letter yester-morning,
Saying, “Come my boy, your Mother dear is dead.”
O it said, “Forgive the angry words ’twere spoken,
You know I never meant them, don’t you, Jack?
O the angels bear me witness I am asking,
Your forgivness in this letter edged in black.
