1.
Down where southern skies are glowing,
Like some region of the blest,
Down where southern airs are blowing,
Lulling ev'ry thought to rest,
Once there dwelt a lovely maiden,
Tuning many a mournful lay,
And her soul with grief was laden,
For her love was far away.
  And her soul with grief was laden,
  For her love was far away.

2.
Long she pined in tearful sorrow,
ANd her love-lit eyes grew dim,
'Till at length these came no tomorrow,
Life was lost in loving him.
After many years of roaming,
He returned (Oh mournful day!)
But no loved one hailed his coming,
She alas! was far away.
  But no loved one hailed his coming,
  She alas! was far away.
