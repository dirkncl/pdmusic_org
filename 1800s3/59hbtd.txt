1.
Oh! happy, happy, happy be thy dreams. 
Bright be the vision that before thee lies; 
Dreams of the radiant hills and sunlit streams, 
Dream of the bright and blue unclouded skies! 
Dream of the bright and blue unclouded skies! 
Sleep, for thy mother watches by thy side. 
O’er thee unseen the watchful spirits glide, 
Pure as the star that o’er thee mildly beams; 
Oh! happy, happy, happy be thy dreams! 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams! 

2.
Oh! happy, happy be thy path in life. 
Long still thy mother’s tender love to share. 
’Till heav’n has call’d her from this vale of strife 
And purer bliss succeeds to worldly care! 
And purer bliss succeeds to worldly care! 
Then if the angels earthward turn their eyes, 
She will watch o’er thee from the radiant skies. 
Sleep while you star still o’er thee mildly beams; 
Oh! happy, happy, happy be thy dreams! 
Happy, happy, happy be thy dreams!
