1.
Oh, promise to meet me when twilight is falling,
Beside the bright waters that slumber so fair;
Each bird in the meadow your name will be calling,
And ev'ry sweet rosebud will look for you there;
It's morning and evening, for you I am sighing.
The heart in my bosom is yours evermore;
I'll watch for you, darling, when daylight is dying,--
  Sweet rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore!

2.
My heart is a nest that is rubbed and forsaken
When gone from my sight is the girl that I love;
One word from your lips can my gladness awaken,--
Your smile is the smile of the angels above!
Then meet me at twilight beside the bright waters,
The love that I've told you, I'd whisper once more;
Oh, sweetest and fairest of Erin's fair daughters,--
  Dear rose of Killarny, Mavourneen Astore!
