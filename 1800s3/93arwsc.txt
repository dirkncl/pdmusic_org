1. I took a ride with Santa Claus 
one happy Xmas night, 
And though it was against the laws, 
It gave me much delight. 
His fare was plump and fat and round, 
it was so good to see; 
I knew his dear old heart was sound 
as any heart could be. 
He looked at me and cracked his whip, 
And said, “now let us take the trip!” 

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
“Heigh ho! heigh ho! o’er lee and snow 
Our journey lies together; 
When hearts are warm 
They brook the storm, 
or roughest of Christmas weather. 

[Refrain sung after each CHORUS]
For hours and hours we journeyed on, 
Thro’ storm and tempest hurled, 
Until at last the rosy dawn 
flushed softly on the world. 
I looked, and lo! my cottage home 
I once more gazed upon, 
But turning round for Santa Claus, 
behold his sleigh was gone.

2. We glided down the village street, 
at ev’ry home would stop, 
The humblest homes would Santa greet, 
and there some present drop. 
It mattered not tho’ rich or poor, 
whatever might befall, 
He gave from out his bounteous store 
some gift to me and all. 
And still as we would drive away, 
Would hear the burden of his lay; 

3. From far a way came back to me 
The burden of his melodie.
