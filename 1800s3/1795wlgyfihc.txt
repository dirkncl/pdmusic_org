1.
When Love gets you fast in her clutches,
 And you sigh for your Sweetheart away,
Old Time cannot move without crutches,
 Alack! how he hobbles Well-a-day!

CHORUS
Well-a-day! Well-a-day! Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
Alack! how he hobbles Well-a-day.

2.
But when WALTER my trembling hand touches,
 And Love's colouring o'er my cheeks fray!
Old Time throws aside both his crutches.
Alack! how he gallops, Well-a-day!

CHORUS
Well-a-day! Well-a-day! Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
Alack! how he gallops, Well-a-day!
