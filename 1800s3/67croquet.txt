1.
Out on the lawn in the ev'ning gray,
Went Willie and Kate.
I said "which way,"
And they both replied "Croquet, croquet."
Of Mallet and Balls the usual display.
The hoops all stood in arch array.
And I said to myself "Soon we'll see Croquet;
we'll see Croquet."

2.
But the Mallet ane Balls unheeded lay,
And the maid and the youth side by side, sat they,
And I thought to myself-- Is _that_ Croquet?
I saw the scamp, it was bright as day,
Put his arm round her waist in a loving way,
And he squeezed her hand,-- Was that Croquet?
Was that Croquet?

3.
While the red rover roll'd all forgotten away,
He whisper'd all that a lover should say,
And kissed her lips-- What a _queer_ Croquet!
Silent they sat 'neath the moon of May,
But I knew by her blushes she said not nay,
And I thought in my heart, Now _that's_ Croquet!
Now that's Croquet.
