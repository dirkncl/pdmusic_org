1.
Just down around the corner of the street where I reside,
There lives the cutest little girl that I have ever spied;
Her name is Rosie O'Grady and, I don't mind telling you,
That she's the sweetest Rose the garden ever grew.

CHORUS 2 times
Sweet Rosie O'Grady,
My dear little Rose,
She's my steady lady,
Most ev'ryone knows,
And when we are married,
How happy we'll be;
I love sweet Rosie O'Grady,
And Rosie O'Grady loves me.

2.
I never shall for[-]get the day she promised to be mine,
As we sat telling lovetales, in the golden summer time,
'Twas on her finger that I placed a small engagement ring,
While in the trees, the little birds this song they seemed to sing!

(CHORUS 2 times)
