1. A year ago I met you, love,
You seemed like an angel fair,
With laughing eyes and ruby lips,
And lovely golden hair,
In my heart a quenchless fire—
It burned with perfect joy,
But now my heart is cold
Since you that fire destroy.

[CHORUS sung after each VERSE]
The days are now departed love,
The days are now gone by,
In which the passing hours
Seemed like summer time to fly.

2. I left you for a little while,—
Thinking you true would be,
But ah! that fatal blow it came,
That severed you and me,
Lured on by crafty speeches—
You became another’s wife,
And now two hearts are broken,
Which should be joined for life.

3. I will not now reproach you, love,
For pain you have given me,
But give you back the token,
That once you gave to me,
Goodbye, my faithless lover—
No more my face you’ll see,
For the link it now is broken,
That once bound you and me.
