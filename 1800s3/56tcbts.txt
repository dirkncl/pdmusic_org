1.
Childhood's days now pass before me,
Forms and scenes of long ago;
Like a dream they hover o'er me,
Calm and bright as ev'ning's glow.
Days that knew no shade of sorrow,
When my young heart pure and free,
Joyful hailed each coming morrow
In the cottage by the sea
  Joyful hailed each coming morrow
  In the cottage by the sea.

2.
Fancy sees the rosetrees twining
Bound the old and rustic door,
And below the white beach shining,
Where I gathered shells of yore
Hear my mother's gentle warning,
As she took me on her knee;
And I feel again life's morning,
In the cottage by the sea,
  And I feel again life's morning,
  In the cottage by the sea.

3.
What though years have rolled above me,
Though mid fairer scenes I roam,
Yet I ne'er shall cease to love thee,
Childhood's dear and happy home!
And when life's long day is closing,
Oh! how pleasant would it be?
On some faithful breast reposing,
In the cottage by the sea,
  On some faithful breast reposing,
  In the cottage by the sea.
