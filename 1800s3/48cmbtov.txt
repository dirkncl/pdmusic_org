1.
The floating scow of Old Virginny,
I work'd in from day to day,
A fishing 'mongst de oyster beds,
To me it was but play.
But now I'm growing very old,
I cannot work any more,
So carry my back to Old Virginny,
To Old Virginny's shore.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Den carry me back to Old Virginny,
To Old Virginny's shore,
Oh, carry me back to Old Virginny,
To Old Virginny's shore.

2.
If I was only young again,
I'd lead a different life;
I'd save my money and buy a farm,
And take Dinah for my wife.
But now old age, he holds me tight,
My limbs, dey are growing sore;
So take me back to Old Virginny,
To Old Virginny's shore.

3.
And when I'm dead and gone,
Place this old banjo by my side,
Let the possom and coon to my funeral go,
For dey was always my pride.
And den in soft repose I'll sleep,
And dream for eber more,
Dat you've carried me back to Old Virginny,
To Old Virginny's shore.
