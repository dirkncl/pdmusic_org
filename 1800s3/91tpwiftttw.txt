1.
'Tis the picture of a fair girl,
Now turned away from view,
Once a mother's joy, a father's fond delight;
But the tempting lover come
And forgetful of good name
She listened to the voice that was her blight.
From her happy home she fled,
And though tears for her were shed,
No pleading could the wayward one recall;
Now her name they never speak,
To for get her they all seek,
Her picture hangs with face turned to the wall.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
It tells the old, old story,
Of sadness and of tears,
'Tis dead forever now beyond recall;
It is the daughter fair,
Now an outcast ev'rywhere,
The picture with its face turned to the wall.

2.
She had homae and ev'ry blessing
That fortune could bestow
And her glad young life had never known a care
Till the tinsel and he gold
Led her from her kindred's fold,
And she left her fond old father in despair.
In his anger stern and deep,
In his pride that would not sleep,
He cast her from his heart beyond recall;
And with frown upon his brow,
And no pity for her now,
He turns the picture face unto the wall.

3.
Now she roams the world in sorrow,
And in her olden home
With dust is clad the picture and the frame,
But the parents night and day
While their hair is turning gray,
In silence still are dreaming of her name,
In their dreams they see her blest,
And their broken hearts attest
The love that lives whatever may befall,
Yet to worldy pride they cling,
And to them it brings a sting,
The picture with its face turned to the wall.
