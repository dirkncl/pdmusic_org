1. Two little babies Willie and Jean, 
Were betrothed in their cradles one day. 
Round rosy cherubs the sweetest e’er seen, 
as among downy pillows they lay. 
Little they knew what betrothal meant. 
That old time custom long gone by. 
But cooed on their dimpled fists intent 
as their mamas sang this lullaby.

2. Jean grew to wonanhood dainty and small, 
Loving Willie with all her young heart. 
He grew to manhood so stalwart and tall, 
and the two were but seldom apart. 
One day they were wed as the Fates has planned. 
And when a year had fleeted by. 
Two little twin babes from Heav’ns own hand 
came to them to hear this lullaby.

Go to sleep darling, Mama is near. 
Tucked in your cradle, nothing to fear; 
Strife comes with manhood and womanhood too; 
But I pray that no sorrow will e’er come to you. 
Bye-lo Bye-lo Angels watch unseen 
Over little babies as they sleep and dream. 
Bye-lo-Bye.
