1. When in the early dawn, love,
You linger ’mid opening flowers—
Glowing in tender beauty,
Glist’ning ’mid dewy showers
O think of me in your dreaming,
Waft me a tender sigh.
Just say that you love me darling,
As in the years gone by.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Love, sweet love of old,
Whisperings low I hear.
Borne on the murm’ring breeze,
Close to my list’ning ear.
Love, sweet love, of old,
Waft me a tender sigh
Saying you love me, my darling,
Just as in years gone by.
Whisper, whisper,
As in the days gone by.

2. When in the silent night, love,
You gaze in the azure bright—
Watching each woodland beauty,
Pale in the moon’s soft light
Then think of me in your dreaming,
Waft me a tender sigh.
Just say that you love me darling,
As in the years gone by.
