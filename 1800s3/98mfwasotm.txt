1. Down at the station ev’rything was gay,
Troops were departing eager for the fray,
Came a little maiden touched a trooper grand,
Then a bunch of clover-blossoms placed within his hand.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
My father was a soldier just like you,
My father was a sailor and wore a coat of blue,
My father was a sailor; I’ll ne’er see him again,
My father was a sailor sir, a sailor on the Maine.

2. Please take the flowers; place them for me,
On father’s grave sir down by the sea,
Whisper and tell him I sent them by you,
And I know he’ll hear you for you wear a coat of blue.

3. Troopers gather round her; loud plays the band,
Captains and Gen’rals all round her stand,
Please mister soldier do this for me,
When you fire the cannon sir, just fire it once for me.
