1.
Stormy the night and the waves roll high,
Bravely the ship doth ride;
Hark while the light-house bell's solemn cry
Reigns o'er the sullen tide.
There on the deck see two lovers stand,
Heart to heart-beating and hand in hand,
Tho' death be near, she knows no fear,
While at her side is one of all most dear.

REFRAIN
Loudly the bell in the old tower rings,
Biding us list to the warning it brings.
Sailor, take care! Sailor, take care!
Danger is near thee, Beware! Beware.
Beware! Beware!
Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep,
So beware! beware!
Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep,
So beware! beware!

2.
What of the storm when the night is o'er?
There is no trace or sign!
Save where the weckage has strewn the shore,
Peaceful the sun doth shine.
But when the wild raging storm did cease,
Under the billows two hearts found peace,
No more to part, no more of pain,
The bell may now toll its warning in vain.

(REFRAIN)
