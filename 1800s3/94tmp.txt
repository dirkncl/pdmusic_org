1. Oh, Santiago, and de Lumbago, 
And the Senoria dat will pulla de leger!
Oh, Mex ico and the Mexicanoo, 
And de Dago sella de ripe banano!
De night go and de Dago from Italito!
Standing on the corner selling the hot Tomatio, 
Hidalgo Espagnula from San Marlio.
And “The man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo!” 
And the mando lins will ring, 
And Signora will sing, 
“Daddy won’t buy me a bow-wow-wow-wow, 
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow!” 
“After the Rallo, Collar and elbow,” 
He never cares to wandero!
De cat came back-o.” 
The Man in the moon”-o, 
Marry him soon-o, alla!

 2.
Oh, Cigaretto, and de Cigaro, 
Wheeling West Virginia in a wheel barrower!
Oh,l Sil ver Bill and the Buffalo Billio, 
I don’t know how much I owe, Tit Willio!
A young girl went to supper with my brother-o!
Now one of his legs is longer than the other-o 
When she left him he didn’t have a souiio.
For she was one of the 
“Two little girls in blue-i-o!
Oh, he bought her a ring, 
And the maiden will sing, 
There’s a Jay horn each minute or twoi, 
Minnie or tow-i-o!
Oh, Carmencita, Regalourita, And Papacito, 
I’m going to meet her just down the street-a.
With her big feet-a, 
Never look’d sweeter, alla!
