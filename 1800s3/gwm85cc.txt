1. Ring, ye bells, a merry chime, 
To proclaim the happay time, 
When for us at dawn of morn, 
Christ our Blessed Lord was born. 
Greet with joy the glorious birth 
Of the “Prince of peace” on earth.    

[CHORUS sung twice after each verse]
Ring, ye bells, loud anthems raise, 
To our great Redeemer’s praise.

2. Ring, ye bells, so bright and clear, 
They may reach each list’ner’s ear, 
Cheer the hearts of young and old, 
Call them to their shepherd’s fold. 
There, for humble, rich and poor, 
Endless mercies are in store. 

3. Ring, ye bells, for Heav’n hath sent 
Pardon for the penitent, 
God to us through Christ, His Son, 
Grants the boon to ev’ry one. 
That by His eternal love, 
All may meet in realms of love.
