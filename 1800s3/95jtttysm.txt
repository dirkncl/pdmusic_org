1. While strolling down the street one eve upon mere pleasure bent, 
’Twas after business worries of the day 
I saw a girl who shrank from me in whom I recognized, 
My schoolmate in a village far away. 
“Is that you Madge,” I said to her, she quickly turned away, 
“Don’t turn away Madge, I am still your friend, 
Next week I’m going back to see the old folks and I thought 
Perhaps some message you would like to send.” 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
“Just tell them that you saw me, 
She said, they’ll know the rest, 
Just tell them I was looking well you know, 
Just whisper if you get a chance to mother dear, and say,— 
I love her as I did long, long ago.”

2. “Your cheeks are pale, your face is thin, come tell me were you ill, 
When last we met your eye shone clear and bright 
Come home with me when I go Madge, the change will do you good, 
Your mother wonders where you are to night.” 
“I long to see them all again, but not just yet,” she said, 
“’Tis pride alone that’s keeping me away. 
Just tell them not to worry, for I’m allright don’t you know, 
Tell mother I am coming homw some day.”
