1. 
When the heather blooms again, Mattie
When he linnet carrols wild and free,
Will you love me as you said Mattie,
Will you ever faithful be,
I am dreaming of the past Mattie,
Sad and lonely while I roam,
Will your heart with rapture bound Mattie,
When I'm coming coming home. 

CHORUS
When the heather blooms again dear Mattie,
When the linnet carols wild and free,
Will you love me as you said, Mattie
Will you ever faithful be.

2. 
Do you miss me when I’m gone, Mattie
When the shadows gather o’er the sea,
When you think of those you love Mattie,
Do you fondly think of me,
Do you miss me when I’m gone Mattie,
O’er the stormy ocean foam,
Will you meet me with a smile Mattie,
Will you bid me welcome home. 

3. 
When the trees are bending low, Mattie
Filled with Apple blossoms white and fair,
In the valley by the brook Mattie,
Will you darling meet me there,
When the Heather blooms again Mattie,
When the storms have rolled away,
Will the merry village bells Mattie,
Ring our happy wedding day.
