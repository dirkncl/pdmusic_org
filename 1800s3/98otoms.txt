1. O the day’s been dark and dreary since I left my cabin home
Down by the old Missouri shore
But in dreams I often see it and the faces that I loved
With the morning glories climbing ’round the door.
O the old skiff lies at anchor ’neath the willows as of yore.
The grapevine where we used to swing I see it o’er and o’er,
But a voice I heard at twilight I never can forget
The voice of mother singing to the baby.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Rock a low my baby,
Rock, rock a low,
Rock a low, my baby, rock a low.
I hear sweet voices ringing,
I hear my mother singing
In her cabing on the old Missouri shore.

2. Of another face I’m dreaming as I sit alone tonight
One that I loved long long ago.
And I seem to hear the river as it rippled on its way
When she promised to be mine so soft and low.
O those dear old days so happy they will never come again
When we gathered sweet wild roses as we wandered down the lane,
But the vows of love were broken
And I am old and gray
But still I hear the voice of mother singing.
