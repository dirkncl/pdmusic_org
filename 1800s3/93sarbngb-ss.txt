1. Say au Revoir, but not Goodbye,
For parting brings a bitter sigh;
The past is gone, tho’ mem’ry lives,
One clinging thought, the future gives;
Our duty firstm love must not lead,
What might have been, had fate decreed;
’Twere better far had we not met,
I lov’d you then, I lov’d you yet.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Say au Revoir, but not Goodbye,
Tho’ past is dead, love cannot die,
’Twere better far had we not met,
I lov’d you then, I love you yet,
I love you yet.

2. The waters glide, the oars lie still,
A rippling laugh, a word at will;
Where angels fear, fools dare not tread,
Shall live for years, tho’ past is dead;
This one goodbye must be our last,
The word is spoke, the die is cast,
But still my heart throbs wild with pain,
And tho’ we ne’er shall meet again,
