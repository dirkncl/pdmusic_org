1.
Closed in the parlor we are alone
Happy to be with one that I love
I'll ask you kindly oh Mamie dove
Do speak just a few words to bind us in love
I will confess that I have been false
The other girl was really the cause
She is a flirt too and never still
I don't love none but you please say you will

CHORUS
Must I plead must I kneel and you not forgive
Has your heart love been sealed do you love me still
You have always been true now why not forgive
I don't love none but you please say you will

2.
Oh Mamie loved one don't treat me so
You have forsaken where will I go,
Bowed on my knees I pray once again
Forgive me my loved one for I am to blame
Once you were kind and kissed me so sweet
The other girl has fooled me complete
Now I will live true why not forgive
I don't love none but you please say you will

(CHORUS)

3.
Now we must part love I'll ask again
Don't let this pleading be all in vain
You know I love you why not forgive
For my heart is broken oh please say you will
Let us agree love open you heart
Don't let that flirt now keep us apart
I am so humble and pleading still
I don't love none but you please say you will

(CHORUS)
