1. Where wild Flow'’rs glow & Linnets sing, 
To usher in the locund Spring, 
O let me lead my charming Maid, 
To yonder fragrant checquered shade 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Where wild flow’rs glow and Linnets sing, 
To usher in the Jocund Spring, 
Hark hark he swells his tunefull Throat 
Hark hark he swells his tunefull Throat 
Hark to the tunefull Linnets note 
Hark to the tunefull Linnets note.

2. A mossy bank with oziers bound, 
For your delight my fair I’ve found; 
Where woodbines form a sweet retreat, 
Close shelter’d from the noontide heat. 

3. The winding Stream that runs along, 
Conveys the distant hedsmans song. 
The Violets bloom beneath thy feet, 
For nature decks the calm retreat.
