1. I long to hear the stories, 
That Grandma told to me: 
While sitting by the fire, 
A child upon her knee; 
Ah! those were happy evenings; 
No trouble and no care, 
When I sat with dear old Grand ma, 
In her fav'rite old arm chair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
She told me of "Jack  and Jill" 
"The woman who lived in a shoe." 
And "Little Bo Peep, who lost her sheep" 
And "Jack and the Beanstalk" too; 
"Red Riding Hood" "The Babes in the Wood," 
"Dame Trot" and "Old Mother Goose;" 
And "Little Boy Blue," "Jack Horner" too, 
Are the stories Gandma told me.

2. Tonight my mem'ry wanders, 
Back to those hours of glee; 
I fain would hear the stories, 
That Grandma told to me; 
In fancy now I see her; 
Her face as sweet and bright 
As when she told those stories o'er, 
In the old grade fire's dim light.
