1. When I think of the days that are gone, 
Of the Spring when both flower, and tree 
Budded forth as the sun brightly shone, 
It reminds me, my lov’d one, of thee.
When I think of the warm summer ray, 
Of the woods where fond hearts may be free, 
And can room from the worldly away, 
It reminds me, my lov’d one, of thee.

2. When I think of the pale Autumn moon, 
As she shines over mountain, and lea;
Like Spring’s morning or Summer’s bright noon, 
It reminds me, my lov’d one of thee.
When I think of the long winter eve,
Or of friends far away o’er the sea,
And of those for whose absence we grieve,
It reminds me, my lov’d one, of thee.

3. Thus all seasons, all months in the year,
All I think of and all that I see,
The fond smile, the affectionate tear,
All reminds me, my lov’d one, of thee.
Oh thine image forever shall dwell,
In my heart, dearest fix’d it will be,
Until death or till Heaven shall tell
Time! to bring back my lov’d one to me.
