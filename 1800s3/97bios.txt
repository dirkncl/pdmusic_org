1.
Somewhere the sun is shining,
Somwwhere the songbirds dwell;
Hush then, thy sad repining;
God lives, and all is well.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Somewhere, Somewhere,
Beautiful Isle of Somewhere!
Land of the true, where we live anew--
Beautiful Isle of Somewhere!

2.
Somewhere the day is longer,
Somwehere the task is done;
Somewhere the heart is stronger,
Somewhere the guer donwon.

3.
Somewhere the load is lifted,
Close by an open gate;
Somewhere the clouds are rifted,
Somewhere the angels wait.
