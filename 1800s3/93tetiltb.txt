1.
You ask me eyes I love the best,
If black, or blue, or gray?
I knew not which I prize the most,
I really cannot say;
I only know they watch for me
At noontime and at night,
They greet me and they say good bye,
And when I come, grow bright.

CHORUS
Sad and bright are the loving eyes
Up at the windowpane,
Bidding my welcome and good bye--
Never I look in vain.
In them I see a loving heart
That beats alone for me,
Those are the eyes I love the best,
The eyes I long to see.

2.
Tho' paths in life be rough and steep,
Whate'er my lot may be;
Tho' clouds hide ev'ry ray of light,
Those eyes I always see;
To me they tell whate'er is mine,
Each joy, or pain, or woe,
Finds echo in my loved one's heart,
Where'er I am, or go.

(CHORUS)
