Charles B. Lawlor's Great Success
Dedicated to Little Dottie Golding
"The Sidewalks of New York" (1894)
Words by Charles B. Lawlor
Music by James W. Blake
Arranged by Charles Miller

1.
Down in front of Casey's,
Old brown wooden stoop,
On a summer's evening,
We formed a merry group;
Boys and girls together,
We would sing and waltz,
While the "Ginnie" played the organ
On the sidewalks of New York.

CHORUS
East side,
West side,
All around the town,
The tots sang "ring a rosie,"
"London Bridge is falling down;"
Boys and girls together,
Me and Mamie Rorke,
Tripped the light fantastic,
On the sidewalks of New York.

2.
That's were Johnny Casey,
And little Jimmy Crowe,
With Jakey Krause the baker,
Who always had the dough,
Pretty Nellie Shannon,
With a dude as light as cork,
First picked up the waltz step
On the sidewalks of New York.

(CHORUS)

3.
Things have changed since those times,
Some are up in "G,"
Others they are wand'rers,
But they all feel just like me,
They would part with all they've got
Could they but once more walk,
With their girl and have a twirl,
On the sidewalks of New York.

(CHORUS)
