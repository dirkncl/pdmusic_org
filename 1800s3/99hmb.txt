"Hello! Ma Baby" (1899)
Words by Joseph E. Howard
Music by Ida Emerson

(Hello! Hello! Hello!)
1.
I've got a little baby, but she's out of sight,
I talk to her across the telephone;
I'se never seen my honey but she's mine, all right;
So take my tip, an' leave this gal alone.
Ev'ry single morning, you will here my yell,
"Hey Central! fix me up along the line."
He connects me with ma honey, then I rings the bell,
And this is what I say to baby mine,

CHORUS 2 times
"Hello! ma baby,
Hello! ma honey,
Hello! ma ragtime gal,
Send me a kiss by wire,
Baby my heart's on fire!
If you refuse me,
Honey, you'll lose me,
Then you'll be left alone;
oh baby, Telephone
and tell me I'se your own,
(Hello! hello! hello! there [1st time only])

2.
This morning, thro' the 'phone, she said her name was Bess,
And now I kind of know where I am at;
I'se satisfied because I'se got my babe's address,
Here pasted in the lining of my hat.
I am mighty scared, 'cause if the wires get crossed,
'Twill separate me from ma baby mine,
Then some other coon will win her, and my game is lost,
And so each day I shout along the line,

(CHORUS 2 times)
