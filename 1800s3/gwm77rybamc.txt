1. Ring, ye bells, a merry chime, 
Ring the news to ev’ry clime, 
On this glorious Christmas morn, 
Christ our King, to day was born.
Joyful be our songs today, 
As we sing the angel’s lay.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
“Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! in the highest,” 
Sing Hosannas, Loud proclaim Christ is born at Bethlehem.

2. Christmas Bells are sounding clear, 
Our bless’d Lord doth now appear;
In a lonely manger lies, 
Lords of earth and Paradise.
Raise your voice in sweet accord, 
Christ forever be adored!

3. Ring out tones both loud and clear, 
David’s Son doth now appear;
Angel choirs annouce his birth, 
Singing “Peace, good will on earth.” 
Loud responsive let us sing, 
Glory to our Lord and King.

4. RIng, Oh ring a merry chime, 
Ring the news to ev’ ry clime, 
How the wise men from afar, 
Follow’d Bethlehem’s radiant star.
Rais’d their voice in sweet accord, 
Sang their praises to the Lord.
