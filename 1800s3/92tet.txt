1. Now an old color’d preacher while warning his flock
Said meanness was Satan’s best hook;
You can never be saved till your purse you unlock,
And den a collection he took.
The deacon pass’d fathfully thro the dark crowd,
But all he brought back was the hat;
The preacher he took it and said quite aloud,
“Now we ought to be thankful for that.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Thankful for that—
Yes, thankful for that—
Now we ought to be thankful for that;
If we got nothing else
We can still keep the hat,
So we ought to be thankful for that.

2. Did you ever come home from a jolly good spree?
Go tumbleing up to your door;
When your wife pulls you in by the hair of your head,
That night makes you sleep on the floor.
If she goes thro’ your pockets, don’t find any cash,
Your head she will beat with a bat;
And if your motherinlaw, too, doesn’t get in a crack,
Why you ought to be thankful for that.

3. The ladies last move is a very strange freek,
Which treatens to peril our sex;
Why to dress like us men they certainly seek,
And all of our garments annex.
In our collars and vest they giddily prance;
They’ve siez’d our shirt front and cravat;
But up to this moment they’ve left us our pants,
And we ought to be thankful for that.

4. There’s the cashier of our banks, of whom you know well;
He’s a person that looks like a saint;
If he should by chance over hear a bad word,
He certainly drop down in a faint.
This cashier so pious of whom you know well;
On Canada’s side groweth fat;
He skipp’d with the boodle but left us the bank,
And we ought to be thankful for that.
