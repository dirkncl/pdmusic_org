1. Sleep, Sleep and dream, 
dream of all that’s lovely, 
dream of all that’s lovely, 
As we chant our simple lay,
As we chant our simple lay, 
While the stars shine forth,
While the stars shine forth, 
While the stars shine forth above thee 
Keeping watch, Keeping watch till break of day, 
Keeping watch till break of day, till break of day.
Sleep, sleep and dream.
Sleep, sleep and dream.

2. Sleep, Sleep and dream, 
dream of mirth and pleaure, 
dream of mirth and pleasure 
As you gently take your rest, 
As you gantle take your rest. 
Think of those bright gems,
Think of those bright gems, 
Thinks of those bright gems you treasure 
Lovingly, Lovingly within thy breast, 
Lovingly within thy breast, within thy breast.
Sleep, sleep and dream.
Sleep, sleep and dream.
