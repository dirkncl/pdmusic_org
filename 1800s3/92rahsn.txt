1. Oh, listen to the song that I sing tra la,
Of Richard and his sweetheart Nell.
There is never such a time as the spring, tra la,
For a timid fellow’s courage to bring tra la,
To the point that his love he’ll tell.

REFRAIN and CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
It was something he could brag on,
His Studebaker wagon,
And no wonder that his heart grew bold,
For the weather it was splendid,
And before the day was ended,
’Twas the old, old story told.

2. With his stunning new rig and a span tra la,
He had managed for an early start.
Ob serve in this the slyness of the man, tra la,
For no sooner on the road, he begun, tra la,
The confessions of a lover to impart.

3. The ending of this story you could guess tra la,
As a happy lovers chapter closed.
Dickey finally got his answer with a “yes,” tra la,
And has never seen the day he ceas’d to bless tra la,
The nobby wagon in which  he proposed.

4. Now a moral with permission we would draw tra la,
For the modern young bachelor’s sake.
If you’re anxious for a motherinlaw, tra la,
And the finest rig on wheels you ever saw tra la,
Buy a wag on of Studebakler make.
