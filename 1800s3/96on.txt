1. A bright constellation illumines the sky,
Where ever our banner floats proudly on high,
The ensign of freedom, its folds rise and fall,
O’er earth’s richest country, and greatest of all.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]

2. The streams that are flowing our toward the great sea,
The winds that are blowing all breathe liberty,
The eagle now soaring in heaven’s blue dome,
Looks down on a country which free men call home.

3. No monarch his sceptre waves over the land,
Here kingdoms would perish here thrones cannot stand,
Here home is the kingdom by tyrants ne’er trod,
This land knows no ruler save Almighty God.

4. O refuge by Pilgrims for all earth’s oppressed,
Thy beacon is shining across the dark crest,
A light to the nation’s may it ever be.
The fairest and brightest, the Queen of the sea.

5. May distant Orion, may Saturn and Mars,
Forever look down on our banner of stars,
Our sons and our daughters this dear land defend,
Until time and nations have come to an end.
