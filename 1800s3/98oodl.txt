1.
Treasured within my mem'ry
Are thoughts of a summer's day,
When you and I first met, love,
With hearts as light and gay;
A fragrant "sweet bunch of daisies"
You "brought from the dell" for me,
And one little flow'r I've always kept,
A token of love from thee.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Dear faded daisy,
Once so fair to see,
Tho' old and withered,
Still you're dear to me;
Long years I've kept you
Near my heart bereft,
Dear faded flower,
Only one daisy left.

2.
One little faded daisy,
You're all that is left to me,
Calling to mind fond mem'ries,
When you were fair to see.
Close to my heart I've kept you
Thro' many long years of strife;
Tho' only a little faded flow'r
I'll cherish you all my life.
