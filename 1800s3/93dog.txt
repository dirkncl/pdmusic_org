1. ’Twas a sunny day in June,
when the birds were all in tune,
and the songs they sang all seemed to be of you.
And the words I came to speak,
brought the blushes to my cheek,
as you whispered “yes,” and fondly kissed me, too.
I could see the love light shine,
in your bright eye, sweetheart mine,
When the preacher said the words that made us one,
And you were a faithful wife,
thro’ the changing scenes of life,
’Til the Master said your work on earth was done.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dear old girl, the robbin sings above you,
Dear old firl, it speaks of how I love you.
The blinding tears are falling,
as I think of my last pearl,
And my broken heat is calling,
calling for you, Dear old girl.

2. Dark and drear the world has grown,
as I wander all alone,
and I hear the breezes sobbing thro’ the pines.
I can scarce hold back my tears,
when the souther moon appears,
for ’tis on our humble cottage where it shines.
Once again we seem to sit,
when the evening lamps are lit
With our faces turned toward the golden west,
When I prayed that you and I
ne’er would have to say ‘goodbue,’
But that still together we’d be laid to rest.
