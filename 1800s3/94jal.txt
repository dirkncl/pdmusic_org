1. De odder night I went to a walk 
Jus’ a-listen to dis coon. 
Dere was plenty of fun and plenty of talk, 
Come an’ listen to dis coon. 
Dere was one gal dar tho’t she was divine 
Dressed up to kill, how she did shine 
But I had dat walk down a little too fine, 
Jus’ yer listen to dis coon.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Jus’ a-listen, come an’ listen, 
For Ise gwine away right soon 
Not all de tricks dey make could keep me from dat cake, 
Jus’ yer listen to dis coon. 

2. We circled roun’, my hon’ an’ I 
Jus’ a-listen to dis coon. 
De way she cut up would a made you die, 
Come an’ listen to dis coon. 
When de judge dun gib dat big cake to me 
Dere was mo’ fun dan you eber see 
But it wan’t no use for to foolwid me, 
Jus’ yer listen to dis coon.
