1.
An old man gazed on a photograph in the locket he'd worn for years,
His nephew then asked him the reason why that picture had caused him tears,
Come, listen he said, I will tell you lad, a story that's strange but true,
Your father and I at the school one day, met two little girls in blue.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue,
They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love the two,
And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's heart,
Became your mother, I married the other but we have drifted apart.

2.
That picture is one of those girls, he said, and to me she was once a wife,
I thought her unfaithful, we quarelled lad, and parted that night for life,
My fancy of jealousy wronged a heart, a heart that was good and true,
For two better girls never lived that they, those two little girls in blue.
