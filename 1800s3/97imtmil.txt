1.
One day a rich man called his pretty daughter to his side,
And said; "A wealthy friend of mine wants you to be his bride;
Last night he spoke to me and I have promised him your hand,
So when he calls, say you'll be his-- remember my command!"
The maiden said, "Why father, dear, I cannot be his wife,
Because I love another, yes, far dearer than my life!"
And when he sternly told her she must wed his choice, instead,
Or else disinherit her, she wept but staunchly said:

[CHORUS]
"I'll marry the man I love...
No other my hand shall claim...
For I've given my heart to him, dad,
And someday I'll bear his name.
Remember that gold can't buy
Or conquer a woman's heart.
And I'll marry the man I love, dad,
Tho' from you I part!"

In anger proud he stormed and raged, then pointing to the door,
Said: "Go! I cast you off, and let me see you face no more!
You've dared to disobey me but your folly you'll repent!
For out of all my millions you shall never have a cent!"
She sadly turned to go but stopped beside the door to say:
"'Tis you, I, who will regret your cruel words this day!"
And when he said, "Well I'll forgive if you will only wed
The man I've chosen for you dear," once more she bravely said:

(CHORUS)
