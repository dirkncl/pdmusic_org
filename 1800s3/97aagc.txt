"At a Georgia Campmeeting" (9-14 Aug. 1897)
A Characteristic March
which can be used effectively as a
Two-Step, Polka or Cake Walk
A Song in Black.
by Kerry [Frederick Allen] Mills, 1869-1948

1.
A campmeeting took place, by the colored race;
Way done in Georgia
There were coons large and small, lanky lean fat and tall,
At this great coon campmeeting,
When church was out, how the "Sisters" did shout,
They were so happy,
But the young folks were tired
And wished to be inspired
And hired a big brass band.

CHORUS 2 times
When that band of darkies began to play
Pretty music so gay hats were thrown away
Thought them foolish coons their necks would break
When they quit laughing and talking
And went to walking, for a big chocolate cake.

2.
The old "Sisters" raised sand, when they first heard the band,
Way down in Georgia
The preacher did rare and the deacons did stare
At the young darkies prancing,
The band played so sweet that nobody could eat
'Twas so entrancing
So the church folks agreed
'Twas not a sinful deed,
And joined in with the rest.

(CHORUS 2 times)
