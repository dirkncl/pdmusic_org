1. There’s a little pickaninny and he lives far away 
Where birds are singing sweetly in the morn 
His daddy is a working in the cotton all the day 
While the south wind is a sighing thro’ the corn 
His mammy thinks her baby is the sweetest little coon 
As she kisses him and pats his curly head 
And when the stars are winking at the old men in the moon 
She’s a singing as she tucks him into bed.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
When mammy’s pickaninny’s fast asleep 
Then fairies ’round his cradle softly creep 
In dreamland he will play until the break of day 
When golden stars no longer slyly peep 
He’s safe from ev’ry danger care and harm 
While dreaming in his cradle song and warm 
Then why should baby fear when mammy’s watching near 
While her little pickaninny’s fast asleep.

2. In the morning when the sun’s a shining thro’ the cabin door 
Then mammy comes to wake her little prize 
She smiles at all his capers as he toddles ’round the floor 
And watches her with wond’ring baby eyes 
When bells begin a chiming in the meeting house in town 
And the crickets ’round the fireplace start to cheep 
Then dusky eyes grow heavy when the sun’s a going down 
And his mammy sings her little boy to sleep.
