1.
O, sweet is the Vale where the Mohawk gently glides
On its clear winding way to the sea,
And dearer than all storied streams on earth besides,
Is this bright rolling river to me;

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
But sweeter, dearer, yes dearer far than those
Who charm where others all fail
Is blue eyed, bonny, bonny Eloise,
The Bell of the Mohawk Vale.

CHORUS [optionaly sung after each verse]
But sweeter, dearer, yes dearer far than those
Who charm where others all fail
Is blue eyed, bonny, bonny Eloise,
The Bell of the Mohawk Vale.

2.
O, sweet are the scenes of my boyhood's sunny years,
That bespangle the gay valley o'er,
And dear are the friends seen thro' memories fond tears
That have lived in the blest days of yore;

3.
O, sweet are the momemts when dreaming I roam,
Thro' my loved haunts now mossy and grey,
And dearer than all is my childhood's hallow'd home,
That is crumbling now slowly away;
