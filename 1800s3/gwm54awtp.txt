1.
Away with the past, be it mine to forget 
The hopes, the fond hopes that in darkness have set— 
The beautiful thoughts that encircle me now, 
Are as dear to my heart and as healthful I trow, 
Are as dear to my heart and more healthful I trow.
I have liv’d in the past, I have dwelt in it long, 
I have mourn’d it at midnight and told it in song, 
Till my heart had grown wedded to sorrow and care 
And each minnet went down in the night of despair.

2.
That time has gone past, and I rally again, 
Like a warrior in battle, whose brave ones are slain;
For the lov’d ones are sleeping in death, are laid low, 
But the future gives hope for past sorrows and woe, 
Not those wild childish hopes that first thrill’d thro’ my breast 
With their scheimings of fancy and dreams of unrest, 
But a future as gentle, as lovely to me 
As a sunset at eve, or a starlight at sea, 
But a future, as gentle, as lovely to me, 
As a sunset at eve, or a starlight at sea.

[NOTE: "trow" is an an archaic transitive verb
meaning to: think or believe]
