1. 
Oh! who when youth's enchanted hours, 
Like Summer birds have flown, 
Draws not from mem'ry's perish'd flow'rs 
A fragrance all their own! 
Sweet dreams of days long past when we 
Some friendly knee would climb 
And listen to the wondrous tales 
Of "Once upon a time." 
And listen to the wondrous tales 
Of "Once upon a time." 

2. 
We do not climb up beanstalks now, 
Nor with Old Sinbad sail, 
In Iron ships the deep we plough, 
Outstrip the wind "by rail" 
Reality has chased Romance, 
Gone is Life's golden prime 
For evrything was possible 
In "Once upon a time" 
For ev'ry thing was possible 
In "Once upon a time." 

3. 
And if we've sometimes cause to sigh 
In manhood's sterner hours, 
We hand in hand with memory 
Should tread life's path of flow'rs. 
The retrospect may gild the gloom 
of sorrow's wintry clime 
And make us prize the happiness 
Of "Once upon a time" 
And make us prize the happiness 
Of "Once upon a time."
