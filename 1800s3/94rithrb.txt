1.
Riding in the heav'nly row-boat,
Riding for the promid land,
Guided by the heav'nly music
Played by the Big Black Angel Band;
Dip my feet in Jordan's water,
Draw the sin from my body out,
Then I'll enter pure and spotless,
That place niggers all dream about.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Wait 'till Zion's ready,
Then pull long and steady,
Hug the shore, look-out, don't get out,
Where the current's strong,
There the danger's lurking.
Keep them oars a working,
Don't you bob your head around,
But speed that boat along.

2.
Ridin in the heav'nly row-boat,
Steering for the golden shore,
Get on board, repentant sinners
Jump in position, grab an oar;
Wait 'till you hear old Gabriel's trumpet,
Toot, then dip, don't you dip too deep,
As you pass on out through Hell Gate,
Don't wake satan up, let him sleep.
