1. 
Within a cosy cottage,
A dear old couple dwell,
There lived a little maiden fair,
Whom all the folks called Nell,
She was a ray of sunshine,
To that most humble home,
But now alas, she’s gone away,
Some other clime to roam.
A stranger once who came to town,
Quite won her heart and hand,
He claimed to be a millionaire,
His maners smooth and grand;
One day they both departed,
To other lands they started,
But still she longed for home and friends,
And oft was heard to say:

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Back among the old folks once again,
Back among the old folks once again,
Let me roam the wildwood, as I did in childhood
and be back among the old folks once again.

2. 
Her lover was unfaithful,
His life was on of shame,
To guide her steps from virtue’s path,
It was his wicked aim,
Her trusting heart was broken,
Her folly now she saw,
And pray’d that heav’n would guide her back,
To home and friends once more.
’Twas on a Christmas morning, and
The bells rang joyously,
The old folks sat and wondered where
The cherished one could be;
Then ’mid their thoughts of sadness,
Their hearts were filled with gladness,
When Nellie entered cold and worn,
And uttered fervently:
