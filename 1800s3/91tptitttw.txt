1.
For away beyond the glamor of the city and its strife
There's a quiet little homestead by the sea,
Where a tender, loving lassie used to live a happy life,
Contented in her homas as she could be;
Not a shadow ever seemed to cloud the sunshine of her youth,
And they tho't no sorrow could her life befall,
But she left them all one evening and their sad hearts knew the truth,
When her father turned her picture to the wall.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
There's a name that's never spoken and a mother's heart half broken,
There is jus another missing from the old home, that is all;
There is still a mem'ry living, there's a father unforgiving,
And a picture that is turned toward the wall.

2.
They have have a way each token of the one who ne'er returns,
Ev'ry trinket, ev'ry ribbon that she wore,
Tho' it seems so long ago now, yet the lamp of hope still burns,
And her mother prays to see her child once more,
Tho' no tidings ever reach them what her life of lot may be,
Tho' they sometimes think she's gone beyond recall;
There's a tender recollection of a face they never see,
In the picture that is turned toward the wall.
