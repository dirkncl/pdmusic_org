The Original Creation 
"Ta-Ra-Ra Boom-De-Ay!" (1891)
by Henry J. Sayers
As Sung by Miss Lottie Collins 
in "Miss Helyett"


1.
A smart and sty[l]ish girl you see,
Belle of good society;
Not too strict, but rather free,
Yet as right as right can be!
Never forward, never bold--
Not too hot and not too cold,
But the very thing, I'm told,
That in your arms you'd like to hold!

CHORUS
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay!
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay!
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay!
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay!

2.
I'm not extravagantly shy,
And when a nice young man is nigh,
For his heart I have a try--
And faint away with tearful cry!
When the good young man, in haste,
Will support me round the waist;
I don't come to, while thus embraced,
Till of my lips he steals a taste!

(CHORUS)

3.
I'm a timid flow'r of innocence,
Pa says that I have no sense--
I'm one eternal big expense;
But men say that I'm just immense!
Ere my verses I conclude,
I'd like it known and understood,
Tho' free as air, I'm never rude--
I'm not too bad and not too good!

(CHORUS)

4.
You should see me out with Pa,
Prim, and most particular;
The young men say, "Ah, there you are!"
And Pa says, "That's peculiar!"
"It's like their cheek!" I say, and so
Off again with Pa I go--
He's quite satisfied--although,
When his back's turned--well, you know--

(CHORUS)

5.
When with swells I'm out to dine,
All my hunger I resign;
Tast the food, and sip the wine--
No such daintiness as mine!
But when I am all alone,
For shortcomings I atone!
No old frumps to stare like stone--
Chops and chicken on my own!

(CHORUS)

6.
Sometimes Pa, says, with a frown,
"Soon, you'll have to settle down--
Have to wear your wedding gown--
Be the strictest wife in town!"
Well, it must come by-and-by--
When wed, to keep quiet I'll try;
But till then I shall not sigh,
I shall still go in for my--

(CHORUS)
