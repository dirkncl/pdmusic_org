1. The sun sets in night, and the stars shine the day; 
But glory remains when their lights fade away. 
||: Begin ye tormentors, your threats are in vain 
For the son of Alkonook shall never complain. :||

2. Remember the arrows he shot from his bow,
Remember your chief’s by his hatchet laid low;
||: Why so [slumber?] you wait till I shrink from my pain?
Know, the son of Alknomook will never complain. :||

3. Remember the wood where in ambush we lay,
And the scalps that we bore from your nation away;
||: Now the flame rises fast; you exult in my pain;
But the son of Alknomook can never complain. :||

4. I go the the land where my father is gone;
His ghost shall rejoice at the fame of his son;
||: Death comes, like a friend, to relieve me from pain;
And thy son, O Alknomook has scorn’d to complain. :||
