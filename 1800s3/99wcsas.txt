1. Dar is music in de banjo when it sounds,
Dar is music in de whistle ob de breeze,
Dar is music fo’ creation on de whole ob dis plantation,
Dar is music in de buzzin’ ob de bees.
But de sweetes music ever dat I hear,
Is de sound de  soft breeze to me gently brings,
In tones so clear to my listinin’ ear,
When my Chloe, my sweet Chloe sings.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Do yo’ hear dem tones acomin’
Wid de ole banjo a strummin’
why de bees dey stop dere hummin’
when dey hears ’em com a long,
O’er de whole o’ dis plantation,
Its de cause ob a sensation,
Sweetes music in creation,
Is when Chloe sings a song.

2. Dar is music in de tambourine and bones,
Dar is music in de fiddle and de bow,
Dar is lively music eber when the steamer down de riber,
Comes a long an’ lets her loudes’ whistle blows.
But de darkies come around fo’ miles an’ miles,
It is wonderfull de crowd it always brings
Wif ev’ry chile’s face wreathed in smiles,
When my Chloe, my sweet Chloe sings.

3. Dar is music when de red birds chirp and sing,
And de oriole is whistling on his nest,
Dar is music in de tingle ob de rain upon de shingle,
When in de cabin all have gone to rest.
But dar’s not a bird in air or in de trees,
Dar is not a bird dat flies around on wings,
Wif tones as sweet as dem you meet,
When my Chloe, my sweet Chloe sings.
