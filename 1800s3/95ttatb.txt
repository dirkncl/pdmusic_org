1. The new teacher came to the old village-school 
In a prosperous town in the West 
The scholars were always well dressed as a rule, 
And that day they looked their best 
Excepting one urchin all ragged and torn, 
Whom she called with a frown to her side, 
Saying why are your clothes so tattered and worn. 
He burst into tears and replied.

CHORUS [aung after each verse]
Please don’t be angry, because my clothes are poor 
I have no other 
You’re a kind heart I’m sure 
Father I’ve none Ma’am, 
Mother toils alone 
From morning’s light. 
Till late at night, 
To keep our home.

2. A deep flush of shame crossed the kind teacher’s face, 
As she heard the poor boys sad reply 
Then drawing him near her in friendly embrace, 
She brushed the tears from his eye 
That ev’ning she called at his dark wretched home; 
Where she left joy and sunshine instead 
And the poor boy in need found a true friend indeed, 
In the teacher to whom he said.
