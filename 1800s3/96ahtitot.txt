Words by Joe Hayden
Music by Theodore A. Mertz

1.
Come along get you ready wear your bran, bran new gown,
For dere's gwine to be a meting in that good, good old town,
Where you know-ded ev'ry body, and dey know'ded you,
And you've got a rabits foot to keep away de hoodo;
When you hear that the preaching does begin,
Bend down low for to drive away your sin and when you
get religion, You want to shout and sing, there'll be a
hot time in the old town tonight, my baby.

CHORUS
When you hear dem a bells go ding, ling ling,
All join 'round
And sweetly you must sing,
and when the verse am through,
in the chorus all join in, there'll be a
hot time in the old town tonight.

2.
There'll be girls for ev'ry body in that good, good old town,
For dere's Miss Consola Davis and dere's Miss Gondolia Brown;
And dere's Miss Johanna Beasely she am dressed all in red,
I just hugged her and I kissed her and to me that she said;
Please oh please, oh, do not let me fall,
You're all mine and I love you best of all,
and you must be my man,
Or I'll have no man at all, there'll be a
hot time in the old town tonight, my baby.

(CHORUS)
