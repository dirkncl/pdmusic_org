The Favorite Scotch Air
"Auld Langsyne" (circa 1800-1850)
with Variations for
Piano Forte or Harp
Composed by D. Ross

1.
Should Auld aquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind,
Should Auld aquaintance be forgot,
And days O' lang syne.

CHORUS
For Auld lang syne my dear,
for Auld lang syne,
We'll take a Cup O' kindness yet
for Auld lang syne.

2.
We twa ha'e run about the braes,
And pued the gowans fine;
But we've wandered many a weary foot,
Sin Auld Lang syne.

(CHORUS)

3.
We twa hae paidlet i' the burn,
Frae morning Sun till dine;
But Seas between us braid ha'e roar'd,
Sin Auld lang syne.

(CHORUS)

4.
And there's a hand my trusty feire,
And gie's a hand o' thine;
And we'll tak' a right gude willie waught,
For Auld land syne.

(CHORUS)

5.
And surely you'll be your pint stoup,
And surely I'll be mine;
And we'll take a Cup of kindness yet,
For Auld lang syne.

(CHORUS)
