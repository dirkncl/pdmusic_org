1. There is a flag, no tyrant’s rag, known wide as earth and deep, 
Whose collors bright thro’ day and night their guard o’er freedom keep; 
And foe or friend the knee will bend when told in song or story 
How patriots hold with blood or gold will rally to “Old Glory.” 

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Dear “Old Glory” grand old flag, 
She never shall dip to a tyrant’s flag; 
From the Gulf at the south to the northern valley and crag 
We’ll live to honor or die in defence of “Old Glory.” 

2. From north, from south, from east and west, the loyal hordes will muster 
From hill and dale the nation’s best round freedom’s flag will cluster. 
The fair haired youth, a mother’s pride, the sage with tresses honey 
With shout and pray’r firm side by side will rally to “Old Glory.” 

3. As breaks the night she greets the sight the patriot’s heart to cheer; 
Her stars shine forth, a promise bright of freedom with out fear; 
When war’s thick clouds the earthen shroud, and battle wages gory 
’Tis ne’er so dark some ray or spark does not reveal “Old Glory.”
