1. Way down in Loiusiana lives my dusky little belle,
And she’s the sweetest creature in the land,
With her winsome, winning way, around me she has cast a spell,
My heart and soul are both at her command.
When the dew is on the rice-fields, when the sun is sinking low,
Then I go to meet my charming little fay,
And I tell the old, old story, not in high toned words you know,
But I whisper to her softly in this way:

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
My Susie-anna, from Louisiana, I love you honey,
You’ve promised to be true, my heart, my own!
I loves you dearly, and most sincerely,
I know some day you’ll be my own, my Susie-anna!

2. ’Way down in Louisiana, where the butterflies and bees
Sip honey from the flowers all day long,
It is there my dusky charmer in the soft, warm southern breeze
Sits list’ning to the lovebird’s happy song.
And at night when toil is over, then to her sweet side I go,
With a bunch of flowers plucked upon the way,
And I hand them to my sweetheart as a proof I lover her so,
Then she smiles and once again I softly say:
