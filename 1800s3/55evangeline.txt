1.
She is lost to us forever,
  And we look for her in vain,
She is gone and we shall never
  See that angel face again;
Alas that one so lovely,
  Should perish like the flow'rs,
Yet now she blooms unfading,
  In a brighter land than ours.

CHORUS
Alas that one so lovely,
  Should perish like the flow'rs,
Yet now she blooms unfading,
  In a brighter land than ours.

2.
She was lovelier than the glowing
  Of the morning's rosy beam;
And a light seem'd round us flowing,
  Like the radiance of a dream.
She faded from our vision,
  Like a calm sweet summer day;
But the image of her beauty
  Shall never pass away.

CHORUS
She faded from our vision,
  Like a calm sweet summer day;
But the image of her beauty
  Shall never pass away.
