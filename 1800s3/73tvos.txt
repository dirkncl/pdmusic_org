1. There are snowdrops in the valley
  And they look so purely white,
As though they were embodied rays
  Of Heav’n’s untainted light
And to me they seem to whisper
  When earth’s murm’ring voice grows still
Tho’ winter’s lingering gloomily
Spring is coming, Spring is coming, come it will.

2. The chaffinch from the Hawthorn
  Pours its song at noon
And he sings with exaltation
  That Spring is coming soon.
But though the flowers are blooming
  And the bird sings on the tree
And they tell that Spring is coming
  It will come not here to me,
And they tell that Spring is coming
  It will come not here to me.

3. Oh, but whiter than the snowdrops
  Are the robes that I shall wear
When friends around my sepulchre
  Shall strew the flowrets fair
And sweeter than earth’s warblers,
  Is the song that I shall sing
In the land where Winter comes not
  Where is joy and lasting Spring.
