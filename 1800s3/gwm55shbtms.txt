[Ist Voice Solo]
See how beneath the moonbeam’s smile, 
Yon little billow heaven its breast 
And foams and sparkles for a while 
Then murmuring subsides to rest;

[IInd Voice Solo]
This, man, the sport of bliss and care, 
Rises on Time’s eventful sea, 
And having swell’d a moment there 
Thus melts into eternity.

[DUET]
Thus man, the sport of bliss and care, 
Rises on Time’s eventful sea, 
On Time’s eventful sea, 
And having swell’d a moment there, 
Thus melts into eternity!
Thus melts into eternity.
