1. 
We shall reach the summer land,
Some sweet day, by and by,
We shall press the golden strand,
Some sweet day, by and by;
O the loved ones watching there,
By the tree of life so fair,
Till we come their joy to share,
Some sweet day, by and by.

CHORUS
By and by some sweet day,
We shall meet our lov’d ones gone,
Some sweet day by and by.

2. 
At the crystal river’s brink,
Some sweet day, by and by,
We shall find each broken link,
Some sweet day, by and by;
Then the star that fading here,
Left our hearts and homes so dear,
We shall see more bright and clear,
Some sweet day, by and by.

3. 
O these parting scenes will end,
Some sweet day by and by;
We shall gather friend with friend,
Some sweet day, by and by;
There before our Father’s throne,
When the mist and clouds have flown,
We shall know as we are known,
Some sweet day by and by.
