1.
Oh come love with me
O'er the bright moonlit sea
No longer delay love I'm waiting for thee;
The winds are all hushed not a cloud in the sky,
And the moon in her beauty is beaming on high,
I'll sing thee soft lays while I sit by thy side;
As o'er the still waters we silently glide

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then come love with me
O'er the bright moonlit sea,
No longer delay love
I'm waiting for thee.

2.
Come away love away
Oh why dost thou stay,
'Tis love's witching hour love oh haste thee I pray,
Above and below all is calm and serene,
It wants but thy presence to perfect the scene,
My bosom is burning with anger delight,
To gaze on thy beauty thou queen of the night.
