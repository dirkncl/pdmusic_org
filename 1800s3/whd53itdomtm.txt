1. “Is this death? Oh mother, tell me, 
Tell me, am I dying now? 
Of, what means this chilly dampness 
That is gath’ring on my brow? 
Wipe away those tears, dear mother, 
Do not longer weep for me. 
For, ere long from ev’ry sorrow, 
Ev’ry care I shall be free.” 

2. “And within the drear old church yard, 
Dearest mother, I shall lie, 
And the  winds will chant my requiem, 
As they wander lightly by. 
Although sad must be our parting, 
Yet I would not longer stay. 
I am weary, death awaiting, 
And I long to be away.”

3. Where her dark curls swept the pillow,
One bright ray of sunshine stole,
And its beams were slowly fading
With the lifelight of her soul.
Night drew on— the shadows deepened,
And the full moon rose and set;
Still the mother watched untiringly,
For her spirit lingered yet.

4. “Dearest mother, I shall leave you
In the wide world all alone,
But we soon shall be united,
Where all partings are unknown.
Mother, mists are darkly gathering
All around my mortal sight,
But the very thought of Heaven,
Fills my soul with purest light.”

5. “Angels call me, dearest mother,
I must say, at last, ‘good bye.’
They are waiting to attend me
To my happy home on high.”
When the early beam of morning
Paled the gem of peaceful night,
Free from earthly care or sorrow
Did her spirit take its flight.
