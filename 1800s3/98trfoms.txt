The New York Journal, April 17, 1898]
Words by William J. Hartley

1.
Look up Cuba! why are you weeping?
Why are you grieving day afer day?
Justice may seem so silently sleeping
and turn a deaf ear to you when you pray,
Cuba! cheer up! and look forward with pleasure,
Soon will your sorrow vanish afar,
For in Old Glory's starry gemmed azure
There's room for one more star.

CHORUS
There's room for one more star,
And Cuba you'll find you are,
Destined by fate to be with us,
and Spain will prove no bar.
Rise in your might and fight;
Cuba your cause is right
And Uncle Sam says remember
There's room for one more star.

2.
Long have you tried vainly to sunder,
Cold cruel links of slavery's chain,
Binding you tightly a poor captive under
the merciless rule of your harsh master Spain,
Heroes who loved you, who fought, bled and perished,
Striving to free you day after day,
Soon will their dream th'o' weary years cherish'd
Come true and your chains fall away.

(CHORUS)

3.
Mobly you fight ever resinking,
Task master Spain who spares not to slay.
Led by a Hero ever persisting
and striving for freedom till he passed away,
Our Motto's fair play,
and tho' Spain may raid you,
You'll share the freedom we now enjoy,
And with the help of the Journal we'll aid you,
Dear Cuba, Spain's rule to destroy.

(CHORUS)
