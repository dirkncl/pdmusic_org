1. We’re Hamilton’s Badger Boys, and hither we’ve come,
From woody Wisconsin our dearly loved home,
To fight for the Union, to conquer or die,
And to raise in the foe land our wild battle cry.

CHORUS 1-5.
March away, away, away,
All hearts bounding high,
March away, away, away,
All hearts bounding high,
For Hamilton’s Badger Boys will conquer or die.
For Hamilton’s Badger Boys must conquer or die.

2. We’ve left our loved kindred in far prairie land,
And come forth to battle, a strong hearted band,
We could never remain in our homes afar,
When honor and country called us to war.

3. Our Governor equipped us and told us to go
And flail out the Union’s most treacherous foe,
To pound them right hard on God’s threshing floor,[1]
And not to return ’till rebellion was o’er.

4. Brave Hamilton commanding our stern ranks of gray[2]
We were all sworn to follow where he leads the way,
He’s the man not to quail when war’s cannon roar,
For he has won glory in battle before.[3]

5. And when we are marshalled in battle array,
And gallantly led where fiercest the fray,
Then we’ll on to the charge, all hearts bounding high,
For the Boys of Wisconsin must conquer or die.
