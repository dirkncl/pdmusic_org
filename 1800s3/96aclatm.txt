1. Talk about a coon a having trouble,
I think I have enough of ma own,
It’s all about ma Lucy Janey Stubbles,
And she has caused my heart to mourn,
Thar’s another coon barber from Virginia,
In soci’ty he’s the leader of the day,
And now ma honey gal is gwine to quit me,
Yes she’s gone and drove this coon away,
She’d no excuse,
To turn me loose,
I’ve been abused,
I’m all confused,
Cause these words she did say:

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
All coons look alike to me,
I’ve got another beau, you see,
And he’s just as good to me as you, nig! ever tried to be,
He spends his money free,
I know we can’t agree,
So I don’t like you no how,
All coons look alike to me.

2. Never said a word to hurt her feelings,
I always bou’t her presents by the score,
And now my brain with sorrow am a reeling,
Cause she won’t accept them any more,
If I treated her wrong she may have loved me,
Like all the rest she’s gone and let me down,
If I’m lucky I’’m a gwine to catch my policy,
And win my sweet thing way from town,
For I’m worried,
Yes, I’m despp’rate,
I’ve been Jonahed,
And I’ll get dang’rous,
If these words she says to me:
