Ballad & Refrain [Song and Chorus].
Words and Music by James Thornton.

1.
When first I saw the lovelight in you eye,
And heard thy voice, like sweetest melody,
Speak words of love to my enraptured soul,
The world had naught but joy in store for me.
E'en though we're drifting down life's stream apart,
Your face I still can see in dream's domain;
I know that it would ease my breaking heart
To hold you in my arms just once again.

CHORUS
I love you as I never lov'd before,
Since first I met you on the village green.
Come to me, or my dreams of love is o'er.
I love you as I lov'd you
When you were sweet, when you were sweet sixteen.

2.
Last night I dreamt I held your hand in mine,
And once again you were my happy bride,
I kiss'd you as I did in Auld Lang Syne,
As to the church we wander'd by side.
The love I bear for you can never die;
Without you, I had rather not be born;
And, even tho' we never meet again,
I love you as the sunshine loves the morn.

(CHORUS)
