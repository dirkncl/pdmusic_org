1. Come all you colored people, who have got a soul to save,
I’ve got a few questions I want to ax;
I’m gwine to tell you ’bout your doin’s and your wicked ways,
I’ll pin you down to rock bottom fac’s;
Don’t you know de time am comin’ dat de darkies all must go,
To take dat elevator for de bright and golden shore, Oh!
Don’t you know you aint been doin’ right so come on ’fore its too late,
What am you gwine to tell Massa Peter when you meet Him at de gate?

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Massa Peter’s expectation ob de color’d population,
Come a runnin’ now ’afore it am too late;
Ever since emancipatin,
What has been your occupation,
What am you gwine to tell Massa Peter at de gate?
Ever since emancipatin what has been your occupation,
What am you gwine to tell Massa Peter at de gate?

2. What about dat water mellon dat was smilin’ on de vine,
Dey are gwine to put it to you just dat way;
What about dat pa’r ob pants you took dat made you look so fine,
You’ll have to wear anoder pa’r dat day;
Dere’s a little bag ob feathers and a little bag ob bones,
Reccolect dem hills ob taters dat you took from Uncle Jones, Oh!
What about dat chicken scrape which am bound to make you late,
What am you gwine to tell Massa Peter when you meet Him at de gate?
