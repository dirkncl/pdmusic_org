1.
If you want to git to Heaven on de nickleplated road,
Just push dem clouds away!
Bring along all yer baggage and check it to de Lord,
When you push dem clouds away!
If de train am a-speedin' an' you can't catch on,
When you push dem clouds away!
You're a coon dat's gone, and wuss dan none,
When push dem clouds away!

CHORUS 2 times
Just push! Don't shove!
Just push dem clouds away!
Keep a-pushin', an' a-shovin' an' a pushin' an a-shovin',
'Till you push dem clouds away!

2.
Oh, de chickens up dere don't have to scratch,
When you push dem clouds away!
All the green and yaller is dem watermillion patch,
When you push dem clouds away!
If de people am a-yellin' for some pie and milk,
Just push dem clouds away!
De angels dere all dress in silk,
When you push dem clouds away!

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
There'll be no boys a-puffin' cigarettes,
When you push dem clouds away!
They'll all have wings those mammy's little pets,
When you push dem clouds away!
Old Gabriel's horn will toot and roar,
When you push dem clouds away!
There'll be no dudes around the stage door,
When you push dem clouds away!

(CHORUS 2 times)
