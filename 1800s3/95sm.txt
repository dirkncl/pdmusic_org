1. Two little tods with golden hair,
Two little ones at play;
The girl is a hammock, the boy without,
I listened and heard him say
“I’se getting tired of swinging zis fing,
you hasent swinged me all this day
If you don’t swing me for just six million hours,
I isest a going to play,
The little girl pouted and tossed her bright curls
And said, “Tommy Jones, you go home,
I don’t have to have any body swing me
because I can swing all alone.”

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Swinging in the hammock ’neath the sturdy old oak tree—
Tommy Jones and Nellie May as happy as can be—
Tommy thinks that Nelly should puch him the most and she
says “Tommy, you naughty boy, this is my hammock,
Besides, you are bigger than me.”

2. Tommy’s blue eyes filled up with tears,
Two little cheeks flushed red;
He looked at his playmate and sobbingly cried,
“I don’t tink you mean what you said—
We have been sweethearts for such a long time,
you know I love you very dear—
And if I go home and leave you all alone,
I’ll bet you will wish I’ve back here”—
Then Nellie repenten and said with a smile,
“Now Tom, that was only pretend,
I’ll swing you for six million hours and a half
but then you must swing me again.”
