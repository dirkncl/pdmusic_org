1. Oh Nanny wilt thou gang with me
  Nor sigh to leave the charming town
Can silent glens have charms for thee
  The lowly cot and russet gown
No longer drest in silken sheen
  No longer drek’d with jewels rare
Say canst thou quit the busy scene
  Where thou wert fairest of the fair
Say canst thou quit the busy scene
  Were thou wert fairest of the fair
Were thou wert fairest
  Were thou wert fairest
Were thou wert fairest of the fair.

2. O Nanny when thourt far awa
  Wilt thou not cast a wish behind
Say canst thou face thy flaky snaw
  Nor shring before the warping wind
O can that fast and gentle mien
  Severest hard ships learn to bear
Nor sad regres each courtly scene
  Where thou wert fairest of the fair.
Nor sad regres each courtly scene
  Where thou wert fairest of the fair.
Were thou wert fairest
  Were thou wert fairest
Were thou wert fairest of the fair.

3. O Nanny canst thou love so true
  ’Thro perils keen with me to go
Or when thy swain mishap shall rue
  To share with him the Pang of woe
And when invading pains befall
  Will thou assume the nurses care
Nor wishful those gay scenes recall
  Were thou wert fairest of the fair.
Nor wishful those gay scenes recall
  Were thou wert fairest of the fair.
Were thou wert fairest
  Were thou wert fairest
Were thou wert fairest of the fair.

4. And when at last thy love shall die
  Wilt thou receive his parting breath
Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh
  And cheer with smiles the bed of death
And wilt thou o’er his much lov’d clay
  Strew flowers and drop the tender tear
Nor then regret those scenes so gay
  Were thou wert fairest of the fair.
Nor then regret those scenes so gay
  Were thou wert fairest of the fair.
Were thou wert fairest
  Were thou wert fairest
Were thou wert fairest of the fair.
