1. Its just one little year, Norine, one little year today
Since we strolled hand in hand to church, where bells were ringing gay;
The same gay crowd that gathered there, and heard our wedding bell,
Ere twelve months passed were there in tears, brought by your fun’ral knell,
They were plain country folks, Noringe, and friends of yours and mine,
Both services, love, were perfumed by that same old divine;
Friends strove in vain, me to console, but none can full your place,
I never will find happiness, till me meet face to face.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sweet Norine, my love grows stronger,
Tho’ your voice is silenced now forever here,
Life holds it’s charms for me no longer,
Time’s wrought a change, in just one little year.

2. In just one little year, Norine, in just one little year
Our wedding past, the baby came, it’s died since you were here;
I missed you but our baby boy, missed you much more it seems,
And left this world to search for you, in that bright land of dreams;
I laid him by your side, Norline, and there’s a place for me,
That when the judgement day rolls round, together we may be;
Somewhere, some sweet day, we will meet in realms beyond the sky,
For love like ours, my darling wife, can never, never die.
