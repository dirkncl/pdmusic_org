1. “Tell me what you does with all your money,” says Phoebe, 
“Tell me how you gits rid of all your money,” says Phoebe! 
I takes our the dice and rolls dem, so! 
Is dat you seven? Mm, Mm? No, so! 
Oh, dat’s de way my money does go, Phoebe! 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
“Oh, Oh, Oh, please lemme know, Phoebe, 
if you love me, tell me so! 
“Oh, Oh, Oh, please lemme know; Phoebe, 
if you love me, tell me so! 

CHORUS [sung twice after each REFRAIN]
Stars are shiing, 
The moon am climbing, 
Meet me, Phoebe Jane! 
Come, my honey, I’se got money, 
Come, my honey, I’se got money, 
And we’ll take de train. train.

2. “When the wint’ry winds begin to blow,” says Phoebe, 
“Nothing then in sight, for to eat, but snow,” says Phoebe! 
I gathers the money layin’ round, 
You saves yours up and I saves mine down; 
Oh! hold your job, we’ll own this town, Phoebe!
