1. ’Tis believ’d that this Harp, which I wake now for thee,
Was a Syren of old, who sung under the sea;
And who often, at eve, thro’ the bright waters roved,
To meet, on the green shore, a youth whom she loved.

2. But she loved hime in vain, for he left her to weep,
And in tears, all the night, her gold treses to sleep,
Till heav’n look’d with pity on true love so warm,
And changed to this soft Harp the seamaiden’s form.

3. Still her bosom rose fair— still her cheeks smiled the same—
While her seabeauties gracefully form’d the light frame;
And her hair, as, let loose, o’er her white arm it fell,
Was changed to bright chords, utt’ring melody’s spell.

4. Hence it came, that this soft Harp so long hath been known
To mingle love’s language with sorrow’s sad tone;
Till thou didst divide them, and teach the fond lay
To speak love when I’m near thee, and grief when away.
