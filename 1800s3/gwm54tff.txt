The Firefly ’neath the morning sky 
When the sun shines forth in spring 
Unheeded is by mortal eye 
Floating on airy 

But when the brightest day has past 
Amid the shades of night. 
The Firefly’s sparkling gleam at last 
Shed forth a fairy light 

The Firefly¹s spaekling gleam at last. 
Sheds forth a fairry light. 
Should time our fondest hopes decay 
And darkness hover round; 

Oh! may there still some gentle ray 
Some light like theirs be found 
Oh! may there still some gentle ray, 
Some light like theirs be found.
