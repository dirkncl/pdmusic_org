1. A litlte home so happy, once cheerful and so bright, 
And a loving couply dwelt within its walls, 
For fair haired romping children with hearts so gay and light 
Kept joy and laughter ringing through the halls. 
A shadow dark and gloomy fell on the home one day: 
Through jealousy alone the wife had fled; 
His picture and the wedding ring, she’d taken both away; 
The husband sent aletter; this it said: 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Send back the picture and the wedding ring. 
That I gave in days of yore. 
Let not a token of the old love cling, 
Then I’ll ask for nothing more.

2. Soon time rolled by; ’twas Christmas, the lights were burning bright, 
And gentle foot steps enter at the door; 
And tears of joy wre falling upon that Christmas night; 
The wife was in her husband’s arms once more. 
She told how t’was through falsehood she thought he was untrue; 
How that she’d learned the truth while gone away 
Yet still was pure and honest, they started life anew, 
And ne’er again these words to her he’ll say.
