1. Down a winding road at eve,
We strayed my love and I,
’Twas cov ered o’er with leaves.
The soft wind murmered by,
We spied the Gypsie’s camp
Among the trees so brown
And I told her that I loved her
while the leaves came drifting down.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
While the leaves came drifting down,
we strayed my love and I.
We wandered on so happy
’neath the moonlit evening sky.
I think I see my sweetheart still
with eyes of softest brown
When I told her that I loved her
while the leaves came drifting down.

2. From among the trees there came
A Gypsy bent and old
O pretty Miss she cried,
Pray cross my hand with gold,
Born ’neath a lucky star
The planets all agree
Before the year is out
you’ll wed  a man of high degree.

3. The Gypsy’s words came true.
Her vows she broke to me
She sold her heart for gold
To a man of high degree
Now in the twilight gray
I see her eyes so brown
The winding road the Gypsy old
while the leaves came drifting down.
