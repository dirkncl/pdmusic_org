1. 
I've been working on the railroad, 
All the live-long day; 
I've been working on the railroad, 
Just to pass the time away. 
Don't you hear the whistle blowin', 
Rise up so early in the morn, 
Don't you hear the captain shoutin': 
"Dinah, blow your horn." 

Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, 
Dinah, won't you blow your horn, 
Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, won't you blow, 
Dinah, won't you blow your horn. 

Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, 
Someone's in the kitchen I know, 
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, 
Strummin' on the old banjo.

 2. 
(The) eyes of Texas are upon you all the live-long day
The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Tex-as are upon you 
'Till Gabriel blows his horn.
