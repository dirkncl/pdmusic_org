1.
Sitting alone in my room last night,
I thought of events past and gone.
And of sweet ones that I lov’d so dear,
I was down hearted forlorn.
When mine eyes gazed towards some photographs
that are hanging around on the wall.
There is one there of a blueeyed boy,
And to me ’tis the sweetest of all.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Of all the pictures that hang on the wall,
There is one among them the sweetest of all,
Fond mem’ries to me it does recall,
My baby boy’s picture that hangs on the wall.

2.
I thought of the pleasant moments I spent,
When oft’ with him I’d romp and play,
And when I said he’d be President,
Of the United States some day,
Those scenes came up so vividly 
whilst looking around on the wall,
For among the pictures hanging there,
Is one that I love most of all. 

3.
Once I was happy as one could be.
’Twas only a few years ago,
In a dear home that was all sunshine,
Close by where a brook did flow,
One day my boy was drowned in that stream.
Oh, would that he I could recall.
The only comfort I have left,
Is his picture that hangs on the wall.
