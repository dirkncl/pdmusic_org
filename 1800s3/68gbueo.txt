1.
Shake hands and let the past go by,
Our idle tears forget,
The leaves may fall, the breeze may sigh.
But Spring will greet us yet.
O! heed the lesson of the year,
While all the seasons run;
A smile for those both far and near,
God bless us ev'ry one!
  A smile for those both far and near,
  God bless us ev'ry one!

CHORUS AD LIBITUM [sung after each verse]
God bless us, God bless us,
God bless us ev'ry one!

2.
O! hear it whispered by the leaf,
And thunderered by the wave;
'Tis written on the golden sheaf
And even on the grave.
A lessons which the robin tells
In shadow and in sun;
And hark! in merry Christmas Bells,
God bless us ev'ry one!
  And hark! in merry Christmas Bells,
  God bless us ev'ry one!

3.
A kindly word for each and all,
And come there flow'rs or snow
How sweet the sunlight that will fall
To keep the heart aglow!
And this our song where'er we be,
Until our days are done;
In pleasant homes and far at sea,
God bless us ev'ry one!
  In pleasant homes and far at sea,
  God bless us ev'ry one!
