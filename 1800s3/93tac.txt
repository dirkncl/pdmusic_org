[1.] Calm on the list’ning ear of night, 
Comes heav’ns melodious strains, 
Where wild Judea stretches far 
Her silver mantled plains. 
Celestial choirs from courts above, 
Shed sacred glories there, 
And angels with their sparkling lyres 
Make music on the air. 

[2.] The answ’ring hills of Palestine 
Send back the glad reply, 
And greet from all their holy heights 
The Dayspring from on high, 
O’er the blue depths of Galilee 
There comes a holier calm 
And Sharon waves in solemn praise 
Her silent graves of palm. 

[3.] “Glory to God” the lofty strain 
The realm of ether fills; 
How sweeps the song of solemn joy 
O’er Judah’s sacred hills! 
How sweeps the song of solemn joy 
O’er Judahs sacred hills! 

[4.] “Glory to God!” the sounding skies. 
Loud with their anthems ring: 
“Peace on the earth; goodwill to men, 
From heav’ns eternal King; 
From heav’ns, from heav’ns eternal King, 
From heav’ns, from heav’ns eternal King.”
