1. A maiden and her sweetheart dear were strolling side by side,
He promised he壇 be true to her, what ever should betide,
And as he told her of his love he sang this sweet refrain,
I値l come back dear when the Hawthorn blooms again.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I値l come back dear when the year has passed away,
I値l come back dear when the flowers like snowdrifts lay,
Then the little birds will sing and I値l meet you down the lane,
I値l come back dear when the Hawthorn blooms again.

2. A weary year crept slowly by the wedding day drew near,
His promise he would keep to her, she ever would be dear,
But on that day he sent his word which filled her heart with pain,
I値l not come back when the Hawthorn blooms again.

3. The woman now is old and gray she痴 drifting with the tide,
Her wedding gown she dons each year, her bridal veil beside,
And as the day fades into night she sobs with bitter pain,
He will come back when the Hawthorn blooms again.
