1. I’m just an old vagabond strolling,
From city to town with this song,
And if you will give me a penny,
’Twill kindly sir help me along,
It’s of my old home down the lane boys,
A light in the window I see,
The poplar trees, the whispering breeze,
Mother waiting there for me.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
For I had a mother like you boys,
yes, an old outcast like I,
Sometimes in dreams I can hear her,
Singing her sweet lulaby,
See her dear face bending o’er me,
Just as I did when a boy,
But perhaps you have an old mother too,
Who is waiting up for you.

2. And now alone drearily drifting,
Out on the highway of life,
Just an old wreck by the wayside,
Weary of life and its strife,
The friends of my youth all have gone boys,
But oft in the darkness I see,
One little star, twinkling afar,
Mother waiting there for me.
