1. 
For the peoples good we speak,
And no gain or honor seek;
But the glory of the Nation we adore,
For from every hill and dale,
From the mountains and the vale,
Come the grand old chorus echoing ev’rywhere.

Blaine, Blaine, Blaine, the boys are shouting,
Give us Blaine and Logan, 
Loyal, true, and brave; 
’Tis for them the country rings,
And each noble party sings,
For they hear the sound of vict’ry in the air.

2. 
Yes, we know our party grand
Is the noblest in the land,
And that every earnest worker will be true;
Then no danger we will fear,
For to all the people dear,
Is the name of those who love the country’s cause.

3. 
Then our flag shall proudly fly
In all lands beneath the sky,
And the people of all countries shall respect,
For we know the men we choose
Have the purest noblest views,
For the honor and the welfare of the land.
