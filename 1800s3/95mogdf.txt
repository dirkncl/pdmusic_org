1. I had a gal whith a muttonchopmouth,
And a voice that would raise the roof;
She was the homliest wench in the south,
And she never owned a tooth.
O she went up in a big balloon,
Done floated in the sky;
I spec’s the angels grabbed that gal,
But I’ll meet her by and by.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
My old gal done flew,
She’s left dis world behind;
It don’t seem really true.

Such happiness and joy;
O darkies, howdy do,
I feel as lively as a boy,
Since my ole gal done flew.

2. Now gals and boys, we all must go
And have a glorious time;
We’ll celebrate on the ole banjo
The day ole Sue did climb.
We had boiled onions, sweet raccoon,
And possom crisp and fat;
The music played dis buful tune,
As to our feast we sat.

To see those darkies prance.

Their bunnions soon got sore;
Such glorious scenes wer’n’t in dey past
Till Susan left de door.
O
