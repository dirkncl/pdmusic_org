1. This wide world’s full of sadness and of sorrow
No matter where we are or where we go,
And as we’re trav’ling through its ragged pathways,
We’ll have our share of misery and woe;
But yet there’re some in life that have more sorrow,
While others in this life still have more joy;
And oft the friends we’ve trusted will deceive us;
These are lessons that I learned when but a boy.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Sorrow and sadness! where’er we go;
In this world there’s anguish, mis’ry, and woe!
Some have more sorrow, others more joy;
These are the lessons that I learned when but a boy.

2. One wintry day I saw an aged woman,
A-trodding through the blinding sleet and snow,
Forsaken by her own ungrateful children,
She had no place in this wide world to go;
With grief her poor old heart was almost broken,
And one day in the poor house she fell dead;
If those cold lips had told their sad, sad story;
I believe these are the words they would have said.

3. In days now past and gone there lived a family,
As happy and contented as could be,
Surrounded by the friends they loved so dearly,
They naught but peace and happiness did see,
But one sad day the father fell to drinking,
And all his friends were leav ing him behind;
He’d sought more joy, instead he found more sorrow;
And who’er seeks pleasure there will only find.
