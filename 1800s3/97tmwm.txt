I am thinking, Dear, of the morn we met,
And just as I saw you I see you yet:
A lovely young maiden in school girl guise,
Reviewing her studies with wistful eyes:
Beautiful eyes that seemed to say,
"We know and trust you from this first day."
And I wonder'd, Love, for I seemed to seem
A future was waiting for you and for me,
If ever you'd love me and I'd love you,
With love that is tender and pure and true:
Beautufil love, that ne'er grows cold,
As hairs grow grey and the years grow old?

I am answered, Sweet, for I love you so,
Already the sequel I seem to know:
That surely the future's unrolling scroll
Will show me enthroned in your own sweet soul:
Beautiful soul, divinely fair,
Divine the bliss in the love to share!
Divine the bliss in the love to share!
