1. There’s a mem’ry that is living in my heart since childhood’s days, 
These days of which we all so love to tell: 
Of home, of father, mother, brother, sister near and drar. 
And Rover too, that dog we loved so well. 
But there is one impression that was left upon my heart, 
Is seems to me as closing of the day. 
’Tis the picture of a mother, and a boy kneels by her side, 
With folded hands she teaches him to pray! 

2.  How often on a winter’s eve I’ve nestled by her side 
And listen’d to her tales with childish glee! 
Ahout the Savious in the olden time and how he said, 
“O suffer little ones come unto me.” 
She taught me many lessons in those far off boyhood days 
And me I’d pray with her on bended knee,
She’d say forgive your enemies, lad while your kneeling there! 
That’s one thing that my mother taught to me. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
“Out Father dear, in Heav’n” was the sweetest pray’r of all, 
And after her those loving words I say, 
“Give us this day our daily bread” 
How I remember well,  
When mother dear first taught me how to pray!
