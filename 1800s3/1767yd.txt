1.
A Yankee boy is trim and tall,
And never over fat, sir;
At dance, or frolic, hop and ball,
As nimble as a rat, sir.

CHORUS
Yankee doodle guard your coast,
Yankee doodle dandy;
Fear not, then, nor threat nor boast;
Yankee doodle dandy.

2.
He's always out on training day,
Commencement or election;
At truck and trade he knows a way
Of thriving to perfection.

(CHORUS)

3.
His door is always open found,
His cider of the best, sir;
His board with pumpkin pie is crown'd,
And welcome ev'ry guest, sir.

(CHORUS)

4.
Though rough and little is his farm,
That little is his own, sir;
His hand is strong, his heart is warm,
'Tis truth and honor's throne, sir.

(CHORUS)

5.
His country is his pride and boast,
He'll ever prove true blue, sir;
When call'd upon to give his toast,
'Tis "Yankee doodle, doo," sir!

(CHORUS)

====================================
[from "the original", 1775]

1.
Father and I went to camp,
  Along with Captain Goodwin,
And there we saw the men and boys,
  As thick as hasty pudding.

CHORUS
Yankey Doodle, keep it up,
  Yankey Doodle dandy;
Mind the music and the step,
  And with the girls be handy.

2.
And there was Captain Washington
  Upon a slapping stallion,
And giving orders to his men,
  I guess there was a million.

(CHORUS)

3.
And then the feathers on his hat,
  They looked so tarnal finey,
I wanted peskily to get,
  To give to my Jemima.

(CHORUS)

4.
And there they had a swamping gun,
  As big as a log of maple,
On a deuceed little cart,
  A load for father's cattle.

(CHORUS)

5.
And every time they fired it off
  It took a horn of powder;
It made a noise like father's gun,
  Only a nation louder.

(CHORUS)

6.
I went as near to it myself
  As Jacob's underpinin',
And father went as near again---
  I thought the deuce was in him.

(CHORUS)

7.
(It scared me so I ran the streets,
  Nor stopped as I remember,
Till I got home, and safely locked
  In granny's little chamber.)

(CHORUS)

8.
And then I see a little keg,
  Its heads were made of leather,
They knocked upon't with little sticks,
  To call the folks together.

(CHORUS)

9.
And there they'd fife away like fun,
  And play on corn stalk fiddles,
And some had ribbons red as blood,
  All bound around their middles.

(CHORUS)

10.
The troopers too, would gallop up,
  And fire right in our faces;
It scared me almost half to death
  To see them run such races.

(CHORUS)

11.
Uncle Sam came there to change
  Some pancakes and some onions,
For 'lasses cakes to carry home
  To give his wife and young ones.

(CHORUS)

12.
But I can't tell you half I see,
  They kept up such a smother;
So I took my hat off, made a bow,
  And scampered home to mother.

(CHORUS)
