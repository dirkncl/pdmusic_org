"Little Hallie" (1861)
Words by Alvin Robinson

[Affetuoso.]


1.
Where the green trees are weaving, in an ocean of perfume,
And the blue waves make music on the shore;
With pure hearts to love him, the shining ones above him
Have borne precious Hallie on before,
Have borne precious Hallie on before.

CHORUS
Oh! a sad song of sorrow from human lips must flow,
When the heart feels a woe it cannot tell;
Yet o'er the wintry valley they have borne darling Hallie--
Sweet Hallie--dear Hallie--farewell!
Sweet Hallie--dear Hallie--farewell!



2.
Thro' the long days of summer and the balmy months of spring,
When the whole world to happiness was given,
With his childish prattle near us, and his fair form to cheer us,
Young love made the heart's home a heaven,
Young love made the heart's home a heaven.

(CHORUS)

3.
In the bright green forest, where the robbin tells his love,
And the wild bees are humming all the day,
To the winds' low numbers still his little form slumbers,
While _Hallie_ is happy far away,
While _Hallie_ is happy far away.

(CHORUS)
