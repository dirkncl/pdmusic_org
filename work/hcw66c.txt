"Poor Kitty Popcorn or The Soldiers Pet" (1866)
Words and music by Henry Clay Work [1832-1884]

1. Did you ever hear the story of the loyal cat? Meyow!
Who was faithful to the flag, and ever follow'd that? Meyow!
Oh, she had a happy home beneath a southern sky,
But she pack'd her goods and left it when our troups came nigh,
And she fell into the collumn with a low glad cry, Meyow!

CHORUS 1-4.
Poor Kitty Popcorn!
Burried in a snow drift now
Never more shall ring the music of your charming song, Meyow!
Never more shall ring the music of your charming song, Meyow!

2. Round her neck she wore a ribbon -- she was black as jet -- Meyow!
And at once a gallant claim'd her for a soldier's per -- Meyow!
All the perils of the battle and the march she bore,
Climbing on her master's shoulder when her feet were sore,
Whisp'ring in his ear with wonder at the cannon's roar, Meyow!

3. Now the "cruel war is over," and the troups disband -- Meyow!
Kitty follows as a pilgrim in the northern land -- Meyow!
Ah! but sorrow overtakes her, and her master dies,
While she sadly sits a gazing in his dim blue eyes,
Till by strangers driven rudely from the door, she cries, Meyow!

4. So she wanders on the prairie till she sees his form -- Meyow!
Carried forth and buried roughly 'mid the driving storm -- Meyow!
Oh! her slender frame, it shivers in the northern blast,
As she seeks the sandy mound on which the snow falls fast,
And alone amid the darkness there she breathes her last Meyow!
