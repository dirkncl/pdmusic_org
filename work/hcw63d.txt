Dedicated to J. G. Lumbard, Esq.
"Song of a Thousand Years" (1863)
Solo and Chorus.
Words and Music by Henry Clay Work.

1.
Lift up your eyes desponding freemen!
  Fling to the winds your needless fears!
He who unfurl'd your beauteous banner,
  Says it shall wave a thousand years!

CHORUS
"A thousand years!" my own Columbia!
  'Tis the glad day so long foretold!
'Tis the glad morn whose early twilight
  Washington saw in times of old.

2.
What if the clouds, one little moment,
  Hide the blue sky where morn appears --
When the bright sun, that tints them crimson,
  Rises to shine a thousand years?

(CHORUS)

3.
Tell the great world those bless-ed tidings!
  Yes, and be sure the bondman hears;
Tell the oppress'd of ev'ry nation,
  Jubilee lasts a thousand years!

(CHORUS)

4.
Fearless foes, beyond the ocean!
  Little we heed your threat'ning sneers;
Little will they -- our children's children --
  When you are gone a thousand years.

(CHORUS)

5.
Rebels at home! go hide your faces --
  Weep for your crimes with bitter tears;
_You_ could not bind the blessed daylight,
  Though you should strive a thousand years.

(CHORUS)

6.
Back to your dens, ye secret traitors!
  Down to your own degraded spheres!
Ere the first blaze of dazzling sunshine
  Shortens your lives a thousand years.

(CHORUS)

7.
Haste thee along, this glorious Noonday!
  Oh, for the eyes of ancient seers!
Oh, for the faith of Him who reckons
  Each of his days a thousand years.

(CHORUS)
