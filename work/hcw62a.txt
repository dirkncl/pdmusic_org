"God Save The Nation" (1862)
(A Battle Hymn)
Words by Theodore Tilton
Music by Henry Clay Work, No. 15

1.
Thou who ordainest, for the land's salvation,
Famine and fire, and sword, and lamentation,
Now unto Thee we lift our supplication
God save the Nation! God save the Nation!

2.
By the great sign, fortold, of Thine Appearing,
Coming in clouds, while mortal men stand fearing,
Show us, amid this smoke of battle, clearing,
Thy chariot nearing! Thy chariot nearing!

3.
By the brave blood, that floweth like a river,
Hurl! Thou a thunder bolt from out Thy quiver!
Break Thou the strong gates! ev'ry fetter shiver!
Smite and deliver! Smite and deliver!

4.
Slay Thou our foes or turn them to derision,
Till, through the bloodred Valley of Decision,
Peace on our fields shine, like a prophet's vision,
Green and elysian! Green and elysian!
