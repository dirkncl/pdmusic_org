"Traveling Homeward" (1872)
Words by Cadet Otis, U.S.M.A.
Music by Henry Clay Work
[NOTE: the music is the same as for
"Marching Through Georgia" (1875)]

1.
Let us raise our voices high our
Furlough now is here;
Soon we'll see the faces bright,
Of those we hold so dear;
Ever in our hearts we'll treasure
Memories of the year
That send us traveling homeward.

CHORUS
Hurrah! Hurrah! for we are Furloughmen,
Hurrah! Hurrah! once more we're free again,
Thus we'll sing the chorus,
That all may know us when
We go traveling homeward.

2.
Many are the loving hearts
In homes so far away,
Doubtless now are thinking of
Their boys in Cadet Grey;
And with eager, earnest longing,
Wait the joyful day,
That sends them traveling homeward.

(CHORUS)

3.
"Plebedom" state we have passed through,
And "reckless yearlings" been;
Third Class Camp with all its joys
Will ne'er return again;
But of all the joyous days,
The brightest will be when
We go traveling homeward.

(CHORUS)

4.
Far from "skins" and "extras" all,
How happy we shall be;
Never wakened early by
The sound of reveile;
Tatoo shall no longer find us
"Boning" steadily;
But swiftly traveling homeward.

(CHORUS)

5.
Drills and studies we have had
For two years withour rest;
Some have "Mused it coldly though"
And others "Frigid fessed;"
Few, indeed, were found deficient
By the Board's strict test;
And early traveled homeward.

(CHORUS)

6.
Free from binding pledge we'll quaff
The ruby, sparkling wine,
Pressed by pretty damsels' feet
Upon the banks of Rhine;
Till each forest seems a vinyard
Every tree a vine,
As we go traveling homeward.

(CHORUS)

7.
Soon, indeed, our four years course
At West Point will be through;
Scattered far and wide the
Furlough Class of '72.
Each one should remember,
Though he's changed the Grey for Blue,
He still is traveling homeward.

(CHORUS)
