"Watching for Pa" (1863)
Words adapted and Music composed
by Henry Clay Work [No. 18]

1.
Three little forms in the twilight gray,
Searching the shadows across the way;
Two pair of black eyes, and one of blue --
Brimful of love, and of mischief too;
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

CHORUS
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

2.
May, with her placid and thoughtful brow,
Beaming with kindness and love just now;
Willie the youngest, in anguish did lay,
Stealing sly kisses from sister May,
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

CHORUS
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

3.
Nellie, with ringlets of sunny hue,
Cosily nested between the two;
Pressing her cheeks to the window pane,
Wishing the absent one home again.
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

CHORUS
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

4.
Now there are shouts from the window seat;
There is a patter of childish feet;
Gaily they rush through the lighted hall --
"Coming at last" is the joyful call.
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Standing on the doorstep,
Watching for Pa!

CHORUS
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Standing on the doorstep,
Watching for Pa!
