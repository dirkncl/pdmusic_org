1.
Lift up your head, des-pond-ing Chris-tian,
Fling to the winds your need-less fears;
Zi-on's bright King, your Guide and Sav-ior,
Says you shall reign a thou-sand years.

CHORUS
A thou-sand years, my own be-lov-ed!
'Tis the bright day from heav'n un-roll'ed;
'Tis the glad morn, whose fade-less glo-ry,
Proh-ets and bards so long fore-told.

2.
What if the clouds, one lit-tle mom-ent,
Hide the sweet light where morn ap-pears?
Bright is the day, where Christ in glo-ry,
Says you shall reign a thou-sand years.

(CHORUS)

3.
Strong are the foes thy path sur-round-ing,
Scorn-ing a-like thy prayers and tears;
Sweet is the voice of Him whose prom-ise
Say you shall reign a thou-sand years.

(CHORUS)

4.
A thou-sand years! O day of glo-ry!
'Tis the bright star when morn ap-pears;
The her-ald dawn of bliss-ful ag-es,
And ev-ery day a thou-sand years.

(CHORUS)
