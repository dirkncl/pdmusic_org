[con espress.]
1.
For sixteen years, a merry, laughing maiden,
  I have warbl'd only songs of joy;
And in this heart, so very lightly laden,
  Happy thoughts have ever found employ.
But times will change! and now there comes a sorrow,
  Which bids me ev'ry joy resign:

[REFRAIN]
My Georgie sails for China seas tomorrow,
  And he knows not yet that he is mine--
My Georgie sails for China seas tomorrow,
  And he knows not yet that he is mine--

2.
How should he know? 'twas from a dream awaking,
  When they told me he and I must part;
For not until the tie was nearly breaking,
  Had I felt its tendrils on my heart.
These lips are seal'd--I cannot tell my sorrow,
  And hope must die without a sign:

{REFRAIN)

3.
Oh, who can tell the fearful scenes of danger,
  And the hardships Georgie dear must know!
On stormy seas, in foreign lands a stranger,
  Oh, I cannot, cannot let him go!
My heart will break! where shall I patience borrow,
  For months thro' which I can but pine?

(REFRAIN)

4.
The last farewell--that solemn word is spoken,
  And my spirit trembles with its thrill;
His manly tones, by deep emotion broken,
  In my inmost soul are ringing still.
But strange, wild joy is mingled with my sorrow,
  And smiles among my tear-drops shine:

REFRAIN
My Georgie sails for China seas to-morrow,
  But he knows--he knows that he is mine.
My Georgie sails for China seas to-morrow,
  But he knows--he knows that he is mine.
