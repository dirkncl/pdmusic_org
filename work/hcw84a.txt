Sung by J. M. Woods, of Barlow Wilson's Minstrels
"Drop the Pink Curtains" (1884)
Words and Music by Henry Clay Work

1.
Baby girl, my beauty! now hush while I sing.
Birdies in the treetops have folded each wing.
Pussy in the corner lies curl'd in a heap;
Bonnie and Bess in the barn are asleep,
Long ago sank the great sun in the west;
Pillow as calmy your head on my breast;
Stars are softly twinkling afar in the skies,
Drop the pink curtains down over your eyes!

Chorus
Baby girl, my beauty! now hush while I sing.
Birdies in the treetops have folded each wing.
Stars are softly twinkling afar in the skies,
Drop the pink curtains down over your eyes!


2.
Baby girl, my beauty! the Angels are near,
Watching my darling so precious and dear!
Birdies now are dreaming in each dawny nest,
Dream then, my birdie, on Mother's fond breast.
All the day long you have play'd with delight,
Roaming at will 'mid the roses so bright;
Stars are softly twinkling afar in the skies,
Drop the pink curtains down over your eyes!

(Chourus)

3.
Baby girl, my beauty! the dawn soon will shine,
Waking all the birdies, and so will wake mine!
Slowly will the curtains be lifted and then,
Sunny bright eyes they will greet me again!
Sleep till the roses and lillies unfold;
Sleep till the meadows are lighted with gold;
Stars are softly twinkling afar in the skies,
Drop the pink curtains down over your eyes!

(Chorus)
