"Lilly Willy Woken" (1855)
by Henry Clay Work

1.
Bill Vining had a sorrel colt
  Some two years old or more,
But the colt was wild as a mountain deer
  And a bridle never wore;
And so one day,
  Bill took his colt
named Lilly Willy Woken,
  And whipp'd him till his stubborn will
And the whiplash both were broken!

CHORUS
Broke! Broke! Broken!
Your stubborn will is broken
You will dance no more on the sable floor,
O Lilly Willy Woken!

2.
Bill Vining was a banker --
  He had a bag of gold;
And not only uncurrent coin,
  But customers he sold,
But while he went to break his colt
  Young Lilly Willy Woken
His teller told, with his bag of gold
  And thus the bank was broken.

CHORUS
Broke! Broke! Broken
Your master's bank is broken!
He will count no more his profits o'er
O Lilly Willy Woken!

3.
Bill Vining was a lover --
  He had a lady fair,
Who had said thro' life she'd be his wife
  And his bag of gold would share;
But when she saw that all was lost,
  Save Lilly Willy Woken,
She felt inclined to change her mind
  And so his heart was broken.

CHORUS
Broke! Broke! Broken
Your master's heart is broken!
He will sing no more at his lady's door,
O Lilly Willy Woken!

4.
Bill Vining was a mourner --
  He had a host of woes,
And grave despair was pictured where
  A smile did once repose.
And so he took the halter off
  From Lilly Willy Woken,
And from a shelf he hung himself
  And thus his neck was broken!

CHORUS
Broke! Broke! Broken
Your master's neck is broken!
And you see what came of a stubborn frame
O Lilly Willy Woken!
