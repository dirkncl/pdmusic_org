"Phantom Footsteps" (1876)
-------------------------
She stands for a moment on the rocky cliff,
gazing at the storm-driven billows. Now,
clasping her infant more closely to her
bosom, she plunges into the sea, hoping thus
to end her sorrows and hide her shame.
Fishermen, passing near, rescue her before
the vital spark is quenched; but alas! an
overwhelming surge tears the child from
her weakened embrace, and it is lost.

1.
Childish foosteps, just behind her,
Softly patter on the green.
Back she glances; tears may blind her,
But no little one is seen.
Blanched, as by an ill appalling,
Home in terror hastens she,
While a baby voice is calling,
"Mother! mother! wait for me."

CHORUS
Phantom footsteps! hear them
falling (falling, falling),
falling (falling, falling)
Now, wherever she may be!
(hear footsteps falling!)
While a baby voice is
call- (calling, calling,)
-ing, (calling, calling,)
"Mother! mother! wait for me."

2.
Sobbing still, but never lagging,
Soon she enters the gate,
And before her, on the flagging,
Sees the symbols of her fate:
Tiny shoeprints, plainly speaking
Of the salt and foamy sea.
Hark! was that the doorhinge creaking?
"Mother! mother! wait for me."

(CHORUS)

3.
Half her night is spent in weeping,
Ere she can forget her cares:
Is there not an infant creeping--
Creeping slowly up the stairs?
Venturing thither in her yearning,
Only shadows can she see;
But she hears the cry while turning,
"Mother! mother! wait for me."

(CHORUS)
