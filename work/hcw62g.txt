1.
Uncle Joe comes home a singing,
    Hail, Columby!
Glorious times de Lord is bringin' --
    Now let me die.
Fling the chains into the ribber --
    Lay de burden by;
Dar is one who will delibber --
    Now let me die.

CHORUS
Ring de Bells in eb'ry steeple!
    Raise the Flag on high!
De Lord has come to Sabe the people --
    Now let me die.

2.
Bressed days, I lib to see dem,
    Hail Columby!
I hab drawn a breff of freedom --
    Now let me die.
Ninety years I bore the burden,
    Den he heard me cry;
Standin' on de banks ob Jordan --
    Now let me die.

(CHORUS)

3.
Dis is what the war was brought for,
    Hail, Columby!
Dis is what our faders fought for --
    Now let me die.
Dar's an end to all dis sorrow,
    Comin' by and by;
Prayin' for dat bressed morrow --
    Now let me die.

(CHORUS)

4.
I hab seen de rebels beaten,
    Hail Columby!
I Hab seen dar boots retreatin', --
    Now let me die.
O! dis Union can't be broken,
    Dar's no use to try;
No sech thing the Lord has spoken --
    Now let me die.

(CHORUS)

5.
I'll go home a singing "Glory!"
    Hail Columby!
Since I heard dis bressed story --
    Now let me die.
'Tis de ransom ob de nation,
    Drawing' now so nigh;
'Tis de day ob full salbation, --
    Now let me die.

(CHORUS)
