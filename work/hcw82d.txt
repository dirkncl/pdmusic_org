"Where's My Billy Goat Gone To?" (1882)
Humorous Song and Chorus
Written and Composed by
Henry Clay Work, 1832-1882, No. 67

1.
'Twas a birthday gift Miss Posie had
  When she was nine, and twenty:
Not of gold -- Oh, no! -- nor gem, nor pearl,
  Tho' he who gave had plenty.
'Twas a gift she took so much to heart,
  Her neighbors thought her silly;
'Twas a B-A-B-Y (Baby) Goat,
  A snow-white Baby Billy!
Pretty little Billy, Billy -- Oh!
  Where's my Billy Goat gone to?

CHORUS
Take my home! Take my farm!
Yes, me too (if you want to);
But tell me! tell me!
Where's my Billy Goat gone to?
Pretty little Billy, Billy -- Oh!
Where's my Billy Goat gone to?

2.
When she tried to teach him how to read,
  Twas only "baa" he'd utter;
As she coaxed him then with cake and cream,
  He'd slyly turn to butt her.
Yet he taught himself a thousand tricks,
  And many a curious caper;
He would clamber to her chimney top,
  And dine there on brown paper.

(CHORUS)

3.
When the winter came she bought him shoes,
  And flannel red she ordered
For a Sunday suit, with trousers cut
  Four-legged and embroidered
On the steeple soon in tatters hung,
  They set the parson snarling;
And he called that goat Be-el-ze-bub --
  The one that she called Darling.
Pretty little Billy, Billy -- Oh!
  Where's my Billy Goat gone to?

(CHORUS)

4.
He was fond of roaming on the rocks,
  With workmen in the quarry;
And if there he found their luncheon pails,
  Not he but they were sorry.
For he raised aloft his iron brow,
  Despite the foreman's clamor;
And the pails, he crushed them one by one,
  As with a blacksmith's hammer.
Pretty little Billy, Billy -- Oh!
  Where's my Billy Goat gone to?

(CHORUS)

5.
Then for pails replaced and pails concealed
  Each morning he went searching,
Till at last he found a shining prize,
  Upon a boulder perching.
Had he read its label, "Dynamite!"
  He might have known his blunder;
But he gave it one tremendous blow,
  And then came peals of thunder!
Pretty little Billy, Billy -- Oh!
  Where's my Billy Goat gone to?

(CHORUS)
