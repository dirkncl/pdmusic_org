Dedicated to my Sister Lizzie
"Grandfather's Clock" (1876)
Words and Music by Henry Clay Work, No. 52[?]

1.
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,
So it stood ninety years on the floor;
It was taller by half than the old man himself,
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born,
And was always his treasure and pride;
But it stopp'd short-- never to go again--
When the old man died.

CHORUS
Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick),
His life seconds numbering (tick, tick, tick, tick),
It stopp'd short-- never to go again--
When the old man died.

2.
In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,
Many hours had he spent while a boy;
And its childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know
And to share both his grief and his joy.
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door,
With a blooming and beautiful bride;
But it stopp'd short-- never to go again--
When the old man died.

(CHORUS)

3.
My grandfather said that of those he could hire,
Not a servant so faithful he found;
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire--
At the close of each week to be wound.
And it kept in its place-- not a frown on its face,
And the hands never hung by its side;
But it stopp'd short-- never to go again--
When the old man died.

4.
It rang an alarm in the dead of the night--
An alarm that for years had been dumb;
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight--
That his hour of departure had come.
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime,
As we silently stood by his side;
But it stopp'd short-- never to go again--
When the old man died.

(CHORUS)
