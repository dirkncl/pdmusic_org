Words and Music
by Henry Clay Work (1832-1884), No. 54

1.
I'm de only one left ob de Colony niggers;
  How things do meander away!
When dey count my yeahs dey break down on de figgers,--
  Fer things will meander away.
I was heah when Columbus discubbered Ohio;
  I'm dyin' wid hunger today.
Lock me up in a pantry day's filled wid mince-pie--
  Oh! how things would meander away.

CHORUS
Brudder Gabriel, blow! I am ready to go;
  I am tired ob dis long delay.
You've de wicked to warn; better look for yer horn,--
  Fer things will meander away.

2.
I's as poor as de turkey dat Job was its owner;
  How things do meander away!
I'm as sick as de whale when he landed up Jonar,--
  Fer things will meander away.
I'm in debt for my day before yesterday's dinner,
  An' can't find de cash fer to pay:
In dat Savin's Band game some one else was de winner,--
  Fer things will meander away.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'm a gnarly ole tree, wid a hurricane fightin';
  How things do meander away!
All de limbs are torn off, an' de leabes gone akittin',--
  Fer things will meander away.
Send me home for repairs when de hurricane ceases;
  Remember de words dat I say!
Tie me up in a bag, an' don't stop for de pieces,--
  Fer things will meander away.

(CHORUS)

4.
Had my right eye knocked out by a word dat I hollered;
  How things do meander away!
Called a white man a fool, an' an axerdent follered,--
  Fer things will meander away.
Den a railroad collusion run ober some cattle,
  An' one ob my limbs went astray;
An' anudder I left on de cornfield ob battle,--
  Fer things will meander away.

(CHORUS)

5.
Nitro-glycerum cans are not safe to unsodder;
  How things do meander away!
An' wid circular saws 'tisn't wise fer to bodder,--
  Fer things will meander away.
Dis ere top-lock was lifted by red Injun debils;
  'Twas den de black wool become gray;
An' my last wooder leg was shot off by de rebels,--
  For things will meander away.

(CHORUS)

6.
Nicodemus, my son-in-law, long ago started;
  How things do meander away!
An' dey say, from de gum-tree his bones hab departed,--
  Fer things will meander away.
He will nebber come back, let me tell ye--no, nebber!
  To pick up his burden of clay:
Gib a mud-turtle wings an' a free pass forebber,--
  Ob course he'll meander away.

(CHORUS)
