1. The gloomiest day hath gleams of light, 
The darkest wave hath bright foam near it, 
And twinkles through the cloudiest night, 
Some solitary star to cheer it.

2. The gloomiest soul is not all gloom, 
The sadest heart is not all sadness; 
And sweetly oe’r the darkest doom, 
There stands some ling’ring beam of gladness.

3. Despair is never quite despair, 
Nor life, nor death the future closes; 
And round the shadowy brow of care, 
Will hope and fancy twine their roses.
