1. Mother! oh! sing me to rest,
As in my bright days departed,
Sing to thy child, the sick hearted:
Songs for a spirit oppressed.
Lay this tired head on thy breast!
Flowers from the night dew are closing,
Pilgrims and mourners reposing.
Mother! oh! sing me to rest!
Take back thy bird to its nest!
Weary is young life when blighted,
Heavy this love unrequited!
Mother, oh! sing me to rest!

CHORUS [ad lib, sung after each VERSE]
Weary is young life when blighted,
Heavy this love unrequited:
Mother, oh! sing me to rest!
Mother, oh! sing me to rest!

2. Whispers from heaven I hear,
Angels in chorus are chanting;
Soon will be ended this panting,
Rest for my heart is now near.
Closer and closer they come,
Open their arms to receive me:
Mother, farewell I must leave thee;
Mother, I’ll go to me home.
Death with his sickle stands nigh,
Life’s curtain soon will be falling:
Listen! the angels are calling;
Mother, dear Mother, good bye.
