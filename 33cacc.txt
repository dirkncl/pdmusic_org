While our dorters fair, play on de piano,

No more our dorters weep, kase dey all call em black_e,
Mo more dey wan to be, no more wash and cook_e.

Der waltz an hab de jig, cast off an down de middle,
Den in gran saloon, we take the blushin damsel,
Where eyes shine like de moon, an ebery mood de cram full,

Dar dance at nite de jig, what what man call cotillion
In hall so mity big it hole haff a million;
Den take our partners out, den forward two mallock_e
De cross an turn about, an den go home in hack_e.

Dar too we are sure to make our dorters de fine lad_e,
And wen de husbans take, dey love de common grad_e
An den perhaps our son, he rise in glorious splender,
An be like Washington, be contry's defender.
