1.
Flag of the free heart’s only home,
  By Angel hands to valor giv’n!
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
  And all thy hues were born in heav’n.

[Refrain sung after each VERSE]
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
And all thy dome,
And all thy bues were born in heav’n.

2. Forever float that standdard sheet!
  Where breathes the foe, but falls before us,
With freedom’s sail beneath our feet,
  And freedom’s banner waving o’er us!
