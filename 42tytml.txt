1. When young my heart was bent, sir,
  Upon a nice young beau,
So to my ma I went, sir,
  And she reprov’d me so.
“Indeed my dear, you’re joking,
  You’re still too young you know;
So take your time Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!
So take your time Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!

2. But not content with that, sir,
  To father I did go;
But he my head did pat, sir,
  And plumply answer’d, "No!
There’s time enough for lovers,
  So don’t impatient grow.
Just take your time Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!
Just take your time Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!”

3. And now I’m sent to you, sir,
  I thought I had a beau—
Like them you snub me too, sir,
  And tell me “’tis no go;”
The burthen will be ever,
  ’Till I an old maid grow.
“Oh! take your time, Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!
Oh! take your time Miss Lucy,
  Miss Lucy, Lucy, oh!
