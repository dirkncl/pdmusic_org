1. I love to tell the story of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and his glory, of Jesus and His love;
I love to tell the story because I know ’tis true,
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
I love to tell the story!
’Twill be my theme in glory—
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

2. I love to tell the story— ’tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet;
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God’s own holy Word.

3. I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;
And when in scenes of glory I sing the new, new song,
’Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.
