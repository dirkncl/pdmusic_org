"Aylesbury" (1718)
Words by Isaac Watts, Psalm 23, S. M.
Music: anon. English

1.
The Lord my shepherd is,
I shall be well supplied
Since He is mine and am his,
What can I want beside?

2.
He leads me to the place
Where heav'nly pasture grows,
Where living waters gently pass,
And full salvation flows.

3.
If e'er I go astray,
He doth my soul reclaim,
And guides me in his own right way,
For his most holy name.

4.
While he affords his aid,
I cannot yield to fear;
Though I should walk through death's dark shade,
My shepherd's with me there.

5.
In spite of all my foes
Thou dost my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
And joy exalts my head.

6.
The bounties of thy love
Shall crown my foll'wing days;
Nor from thy house will I remove,
Nor cease to speak thy praise.
