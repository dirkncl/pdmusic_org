1.
Fairest Lord Jesus!
Ruler of all nature!
O Thou of God and man the Son!
Thee will I cherish,
Thee will I honor,
Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown!

2.
Fair are the meadows,
Fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer,
Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

3.
Fair in the sunshine,
Fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host;
Jesus shines brighter,
Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heav'n can boast.

[4.
Beautiful Savior!
Lord of the nations!
Son of the God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor,
Praise, adoration
Now and forevermore be Thine!*]
