"Little Marlborough" (1763)
Words by Isaac Watts
Music: anon. English composer

1.
Welcome, sweet day of rest,
That saw the Lord arise;
Welcome to this reviving breast,
And these rejoicing eyes.

2.
The King himself comes near
And feasts his saints today;
Here we may sit, and see him here,
And love, and praise, and pray.

3.
One day amidst the place
Where my dear God has been,
Is sweeter than ten thousand days
Of pleasurable sin.

4.
My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this;
And sit, and sing herself away
To everlasting bliss.
