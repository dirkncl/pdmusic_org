1. Eternal Father, stong to save, 
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave, 
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep, 
Its own appointed limits keep;
O hear us when we cry to Thee 
For those in peril on the sea.

2. O Christ, whose voice the waters heard, 
And hushed their raging at Thy word, 
Who walkedst on the foaming deep, 
And calm amid the storm didst sleep;
O hear us when we cry to Thee 
For those in peril on the sea.

3. O Holy Spirit, who didst brood 
Upon the waters dark and rude, 
And bid their angry tumult cease, 
And give, for wild confusion, pease;
O hear us when we cry to Thee 
For those in peril on the sea.

4. O Trinity of love and power, 
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe, 
Protect them wheresoe’er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee 
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.

AMEN.
