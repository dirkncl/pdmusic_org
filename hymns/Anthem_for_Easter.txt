The Lord is ris'n indeed,
Hallelujah,
The Lord is ris'n indeed,
Hallelujah,
Now is Christ risen from the dead
and become the first fruits of them that slept.

(And did he rise)
(And did he rise)
(And did he rise)
(And did he rise)
Did he rise,
Hear, o ye nations,
Hear it o ye dead.
He rose He rose,
He rose He rose,
He burst the bars of death,
He burst the bars of death,
He burst the bars of death
and triumph'd o'er the grave. :||

[optional additional section]
Shout, shout, earth and heav'n, the sum of good to man!
Whose nature then took wing,
Whose nature then took wing,
Whose nature then took wing,
and mounted with him from the tomb,
and mounted with him from the tomb.

[resume original]
Then, then,
Then I rose,
Then I rose,
Then I rose,
Then I rose,
Then first humanity triumphant
past the chrstal ports of light
||: and seiz'd eternal youth. :||
Man all immortal hail,
Heaven all lavish of strange gifts to man,
Thine all the glory, man's the boundless bliss,
||: Thine all the glory, man's the boundless bliss. :||
