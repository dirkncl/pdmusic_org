1. Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh;
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

2. Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tend'rest blessing
May mine eyelids close.

3. Thru the long nightwatches
May Thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
Watching round my bed.

4. When the morning wakens,
Then may I arise
Pure and fresh and sinless
In Thy holy eyes.
