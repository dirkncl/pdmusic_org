"I Need Thee Every Hour" (1872)
Words to the Verses by Annie Sherwood Hawks, 1835-1918
Words, to the Chorus, and Music
by Reverend Robert Lowry, 1826-1899

1.
I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

CHORUS
I need Thee, O I need Thee,
Ev'ry hour I need Thee!
O bless my now, my Saviour--
I come to Thee!

2.
I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their pow'r
When Thou art nigh.

3.
I need Thee ev'ry hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

4.
I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most Holy One;
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
