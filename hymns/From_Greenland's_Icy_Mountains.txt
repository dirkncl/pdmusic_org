1.
From Greenland's icy moun-tains,
From India's coral strand;
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand;
From many_an ancient river,
From many_a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

2.
Can men, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high,
Can they to men benighted
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! O salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till earth's remotest nation
Has learned Messiah's Name.

3.
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story;
And you, ye wa-ters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glo-ry,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o'er our ransomed nature
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign.

Amen.
