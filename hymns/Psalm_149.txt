"Psalm 149" (1708)
Words of Psalm 149 from
"A Supplement to the New Version
of Psalms" by Dr. Brady and Mr. Tate (1708)
Music: anon. English

1.
O praise ye the Lord,
Prepare your glad voice,
His praise in the great
Assembly to sing:
In our great Creator
Let Isr'el rejoice,
And children of Sion
Be glad in their King.

2.
Let them his great Name
Extol in the dance;
With timbrel and harp
His praises express;
Who always takes pleasure
His saints to advance,
And with his salvation
The humble to bless.

3.
With glory adorn'd,
His people shall sing
To God, who their beds
With safety does shield;
Their mouths fill'd with praises
Of him, their great King;
Whilst a two-edged sword
Their right-hand shall wield;

4.
Just vengeance to take
For injuries past;
To punish those lands
For ruin design'd;
With chains, as their captives,
To tie their kings fast,
With fetters of iron
Their nobles to bind.

5.
Thus shall they make good,
When them they destroy,
The dreadful decree
Which God does proclaim;
Such honour and triumph
His saints shall enjoy;
O therefore for ever
Exalt his great Name.
