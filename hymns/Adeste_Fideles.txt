"Adeste Fideles" (1782)
[aka "Portuguese Hymn", "Lisbon", "Oporto, "Portugal New"]
Words by Isaac Watts from Psalm 92
Music: J. F. Wade

1.
Lord, 'tis a pleasant thing to stand
In gardens planted by thine hand;
Let me within thy courts be seen,
Like a young cedar, like a young cedar,
Like a young cedar, fresh and green.

2.
There grown thy saints with faith and love
Blest with thy infl'ence from above;
Not Lebanon, with all its trees,
Yields such a comely sight as these.

3.
The plants of grace shall ever live:
(Nature decays, but grace must thrive)
Time, which doth all things else impair,
Still makes them flourish strong and fair.

4.
Laden with fruits of age, they show
The Lord is holy, just and true:
None who attend his gates shall find
A God unfaithful or unkind.
