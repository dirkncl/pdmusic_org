"Windsor" (ca. 1591)
Text from Isaac Watts, Hymn II, no. 107
Music: anonymous (English)

1.
That awful day surely will surely come,
Th'appointed hour makes haste,
When I must stand before my Judge,
And pass the solemn test.

2.
Thou lovely Chief of all my joys,
Thou Sov'reign of my heart,
How could I bear to hear thy voice
Pronouce the sound--_depart_?

3.
The thunder of that dismal word
Would so torment my ear,
'Twould tear my soul asunder, Lord,
With most tormenting fear.

4.
What to be bansh'd from my life,
And yet forbid to die!
To linger in eternal pain,
Yet death forever fly!

5.
Oh! wretched state of deep despair.
To see my God remove,
And fix my doleful station where
I must not taste his love!

6.
Jesus, I throw my arms around,
And hang upon thy breast:
Without a gracious smile from Thee,
My spirit cannot rest.

7.
Oh! tell me that my worthless name
Is graven on thy hands;
Show me some promise, in thy book,
Where my salvation stands.

8.
Give me one kind, assuring word
To sink my fears again;
And cheerfully my soul shall wait
Her three-score years and ten.
