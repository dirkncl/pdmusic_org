"Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee"
Words by Henry Van Dyke, 1852-1933
Music (1824) by Ludwig Van Beethoven, 1770-1827
from his Ninth Symphony (Chorale "Hymn to Joy")

1.
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of Love;
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
Hail Thee as the sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness,
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day!

2.
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around Thee,
Center of unbroken praise.
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice with Thee.

3.
Thou art giving and forgiving,
Ever blessing, ever blest,
Wellspring of the joy of living,
Ocean depth of happy rest!
Thou the Father, Christ out Brother--
All who live in love are Thine;
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the joy divine.

4.
Mortals, join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began;
Father love is reigning o'er us,
Brotherlove binds man to man.
Ever singing, march we onward,
Victors in the midst of strife;
Joyful music lifts us sunward
In the triumph song of life.
