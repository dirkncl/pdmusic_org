"Mear" (ca. 1720)
Words by Isaac Watts, Psalm 96, C. M.
Music: anon. English

1.
Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,
Ye tribes of ev'ry tongue,
His new discover'd grace demands,
A new and nobler song.

2.
Say to the nations, Jesus reigns,
God's own almighty Son;
His pow'r the sinking world sustains,
And grace surrounds his throne.

3.
Let heav'n proclaim the joyful day,
Joy thro' the earth be seen;
Let cities shine in bright array,
And fields in cheerful green.

4.
Let an unusual joy surprise
The islands of the sea;
Ye mountains sink, ye vallies rise,
Prepare the Lord his way.

5.
Behold! he comes, he comes to bless
The nations as their God:
To show the world his right'ousness,
And send his truth abroad.

6.
But, when his voice shall raise the dead,
And bid the world draw near,
How will the guilty nations dread
To see their Judge appear?
