"My Faith Looks Up to Thee" (1832)
Words by Ray Palmer, 1808-1887
Music by Lowell Mason, 1792-1872
Tune: Olivet

1.
My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine;
Now hear me when I pray,
Take all my sin away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

2.
May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm and changeless be--
A living fire!

3.
While life's dark maze I tread
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

4.
When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll,
Blest Savior, then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove--
O bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.
