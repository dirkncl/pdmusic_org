1.
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

2.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

3.
Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath bro't me safe this far,
And grace will lead me home.

4.
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secure;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

Amen.

[optional verses]

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear.
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

Mus Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me.
