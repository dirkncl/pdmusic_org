"Blest Be the Tie That Binds" (1845)
Words by John Fawcett, 1740-1817
Music by Johann (Hans) Georg Naegeli, 1773-1836;
  arr. Lowell Mason, 1792-1872

1.
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love!
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

2.
Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

3.
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

4.
When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
