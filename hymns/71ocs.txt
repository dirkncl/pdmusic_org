1. Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle
See His banner go!

REFRAIN [sung after each VERSE]
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus,
Going on before!

2. At the sign of triumph
Satan's host doth flee;
Oh, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's fondations guiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise!

3. Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we--
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.

4. Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song.
Glory, laud and honor
Unto Christ the King--
This thru countless ages
Men and angels sing.
