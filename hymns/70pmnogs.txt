1. Pass me not, O gentle Savior—
Hear my humble cry!
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry!
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

2. Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition—
Help my unbelief.

3. Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heel my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

4. Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me!
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav’n but Thee?
