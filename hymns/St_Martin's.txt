"St. Martin's" (1735)
Words by Isaac Watts
Music by William Tans'ur

1.
Behold the glories of the Lamb
Amidst his Father's throne;
Prepare new honours for his name,
And songs before unknown.

2.
Let elders worship at his feet,
The church adore around,
With vials full of odours sweet,
And harps of sweetest sound.

3.
Those are the prayers of the saints,
And these the hymns they raise:
Jesus is kind to our complaints,
He loves to hear our praise.

4.
Eternal Father, who shall look
Into thy secret will?
Who but the Son will take that book.
And open ev'ry seal?

5.
He shall fulfill thy great decrees;
The Son deserves it well:
Lo, in his hand the sov'reign keys
Of heav'n, and death, and hell!

6.
Now to the Lamb that once was slain,
Be endless blessings paid;
Salvation, glory, joy, remain
Forever on thy head.

7.
Thou hast redeem'd our souls with blood;
Hast set the pris'ners free;
Hast made us kings and priests to God,
And we shall reign with thee.

8.
The worlds of nature and of grace
Are put beneath thy pow'r;
Then shorten these delaying days,
And bring the promis'd hour.
