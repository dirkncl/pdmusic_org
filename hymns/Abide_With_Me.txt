1.
Abide with me---fast falls the eventide!
The darness deepens--Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fall and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2.
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day,
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see---
O Thou who changest not, abide with me!

3.
I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour---
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Thru cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

4.
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless,
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me!

5.
Hold Thou Thy Word before my closing eyes,
Shine thru the gloom and point me to the skies;
Heav'n's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee---
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
