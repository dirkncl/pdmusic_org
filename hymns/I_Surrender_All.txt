"I Surrender All" (1896)
Words by Judson W. Van de Venter, 1855-1939
Music by Winfield Scott Weeden, 1847-1908

1.
All to Jesus, I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

CHORUS
I surrender all, (I surrender all,)
I surrender all, (I surrender all,)
All to Thee, my bless-ed Savior,
I surrender all.

2.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

(CHORUS)

3.
All to Jesus, I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,--
Truly know that Thou art mine.

(CHORUS)

4.
All to Jesus, I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

(CHORUS)
