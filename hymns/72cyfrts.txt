1. Come, ye faithful, raise the strain 
Of triumphant gladness: 
God hath brought His people forth 
Into joy from sadness.
Now rejoice, Jerusalem, 
And with true affection 
Welcome in  unwearied strains 
Jesus’ resurrection.

2. ’Tis the spring of souls today: 
Christ hath burst His prison, 
From the frost and gloom of death 
Light and life have risen.
All the winter of our sins, 
Long and dark, is flying 
From His light, to whom we give 
Thanks and praise undying.

3. “Allleluia!” now we cry 
To our King Immortal, 
Who, triumphant, burst the bars 
Of the tomb’s dark portal;
“Alleluia!” with the Son, 
God the Father praising;
“Alleluia!” yet again 
To the Spirit raising.

AMEN.
