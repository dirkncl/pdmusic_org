"We Three Kings of Orient Are" (Dec. 1863)
Words and Music by John H. Hopkins, Jr., 1820-1891
composed in 1857

1.
We three kings of Orient are:
Bearing gifts we traverse afar--
Field and fountain, moor and mountain--
Following yonder star,

REFRAIN
O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

2.
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain;
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

3.
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.

4.
Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom--
Sorr'wing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.

5.
Glorious now behold Him arise:
King and God and Sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies.
