1. The spacious firmament on high,
With all he blue ethereal sky,
And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame,
Their great Original proclaim:
Th' unwearied sun, from day to day,
Does his Creator's power display,
And publishes to every land
The work of an almighty hand.

2. Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
And nightly, to the listening earth,
Repeats the story of her birth;
While all the stars that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole.

3. What tho' in solemn silence all
Move round the dark terrestial ball?
What tho' no real voice nor sound
Amid the radiant orbs be found?
In reason's ear they all rejoice,
And utter forth a glorious voice;
For ever singing, as they shine,
"The hand that made us is divine."

PSALMS XIX:1-6

1. The heavens declare the glory of God;
and the firmament sheweth his handiwork.

2. Day unto day uttereth speech,
and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

3. There is no speech nor language,
where their voice is not heard.

4. Their line is not gone out through all the earth,
and their words to the end of the world.
In them hath he sent a tabernacle for the sun.

5. Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

6. His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
and his circuit unto the ends of it:
and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
