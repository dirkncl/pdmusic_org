"The Old Rugged Cross" (1913)
Words and Music by George Bennard, 1873-1958

1.
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinnners was slain.

CHORUS
So I'll cherish the old (cross) rug-ged (the) cross, (old rugged cross,)
Till me trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old (cross,) rug-ged (the) cross, (old rugged cross,)
And exchange it some day for a crown.

2.
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it dark Calvary.

(CHORUS)

3.
In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sactify me.

(CHORUS)

4.
To the old rugged I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly I bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

(CHORUS)
