"In the Garden" (1912)
Words and Music by C. Austin Miles, 1868-1946

1.
I come to the garden alone,
While the dew is still on the roses;
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known.

2.
He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;
And the melody that Hie gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

3.
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Tho the night around me be falling;
But he bids me go-- thru the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.
