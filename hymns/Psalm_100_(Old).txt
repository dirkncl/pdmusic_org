"Psalm 100 (Old)" (1551)
Words and Music: anonymous

1.
Be thou, O God, exalted high,
And as thy glory fills the sky,
So let it be on earth display'd,
'Till thou art here as there obey'd.

2.
To take me they their net prepar'd,
And had almost my soul ensnar'd;
But fell themselves, by just decree,
Into the pit they made for me.

3.
O God, my heart is fix'd, 'tis bent,
Its thankful trubute to present;
And, with my heart, my voice I'll raise,
To thee, my God, in songs of praise:

4.
Awake, my glory; harp and lute,
No longer let your strings be mute;
And I, my tuneful part to take,
Will with the early dawn awake.

5.
Thy praises, Lord, I will resound
To all the list'ning nations round;
Thy mercy highest Heav'n transcends;
Thy truth beyond the clouds extends.

6.
Be thou, O God, exalted high;
And, as thy glory fill the sky,
So let it be on earth display'd,
Till thou are here, as there, obey'd.
