1. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, 
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head. 
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay, 
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

2. The cattle are lowing, the poor Baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.
I love You, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Your tender care,
And take us to heaven to live with You there.
