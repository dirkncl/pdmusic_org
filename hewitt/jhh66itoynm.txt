1.
I'm thinking of thee now Mary, 
Lone in my darken'd tent. 
The wintry winds without, Mary, 
With storms of heaven sent. 
But the storm within my breast, Mary, 
Is as the storm at sea 
When the good ship's hope is gone, Mary, 
For you are lost to me! 
  When the good ship's hope is gone, Mary, 
  For you are lost to me!

2.
I madly vision joys, Ma-ry, 
When peace shall follow strife, 
When smoothly we shall glide, Mary, 
Thro' a new and brighter life. 
But a cloud has come between, Mary, 
My heart from hope is free. 
Grief's shadow's o'er my soul, Mary, 
Oh! you are lost to me! 
  Grief's shadow's o'er my soul, Mary, 
  Oh! you are lost to me!

3.
Dost ever think of me, Mary, 
When joy and mirth abound, 
When music swells the heart, Mary, 
With soul inspiring sound, 
Oh! calm this storm within, Mary, 
My evry hope's in thee, 
My life will be too dark, Mary, 
If thou art lost to me! 
  My life will be too dark, Mary, 
  If thou aret lost to me!
