1.
We're out upon the moonlit wave,
  There's none but you and I, my love;
And who would not its dangers brave
  For one look in thine eye, my love?
The stars are winking in the sky,
  The wavelets drink their way;
Then gaze and smile and sigh, my love,
  'Till night has turn'd to day.

2.
If you will sing, then I will row,
  And time it with my oar, my love;
While gaily o'er the waves we go,
  Along the darksome shore, my love,
Oh! who'd not spend an hour like this,
  With smiling heavens above;
Bright waves that dance and kiss, my love,
  And smiles for those we love?
