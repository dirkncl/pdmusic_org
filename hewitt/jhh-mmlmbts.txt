1.
'Twas a calm and moonlight evening, 
  When we met down on the shore; 
And the gentle surf kept whisp'ring 
  The name of Minnie Moore. 
The zephyrs kiss'd her tresses, 
  And fann'd her glowing cheek, 
While we walk'd the land together, 
  Each trying hard to speak. 
Oh, whisper something Minnie, 
  Say that you think of me; 
And that you will remember 
  Our stroll beside the sea.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
The beautiful calm sea­­
The deep, the waveless sea!

2.
Then I pointed to the wavelets, 
  As they crept along the shore, 
Still whisper-ing so softly, 
  The name of Minnie Moore. 
I said­­they love each other, 
  And tenderly embrace 
Yes, she replied, they're sisters, 
  Which makes it a clear case. 
Oh, cunning, cautious Minnie, 
  I would a billow be, 
And hug my loving sister, 
  Just leaping from the sea.

3.
The moon look'd in her mirror, 
  The ocean's glassy breast; 
The stars they twinkled brightly 
  The night winds sunk to rest. 
All nature seem'd so loving 
  That I could not do less 
Than ask her if she'd have me? 
  She, blushing, answer'd "yes!" 
My charm-ing little Minnie! 
  We surely now agree­­ 
And we will long remember 
  Our stroll beside the sea.
