1.
We have heard thy syren lay,
  Lowland Fanny, ever smiling.
We have mark'd thine eyes' bright ray,
  Life's cares beguiling.
Where the proud magnolia grows,
  Is thy dwelling hidden treasure?
Blooming with the forest rose,
  All joy and pleasure.

Refrain.
Oh, Lowland Fanny is the star
  That leads us on to duty;
She little knows how many are
  The captives of her heauty.

CHORUS
Oh, Lowland Fanny is the star
  That leads us on to duty;
She little knows how many are
  The captives of her heauty.

2.
Love has never touch'd thy heart,
  Lowland Fanny! with his arrow;
Thou hast never learnt his art,
  Or felt his sorrow.
Like a gem that steels no light,
  Claiming nature's beauty only;
Thou art in seclusion bright--
  Joyous -- though lonely!

(Refrain.)
(CHORUS)
