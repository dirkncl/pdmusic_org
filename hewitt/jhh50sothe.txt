1.
My father-land! dear father-land!,
  I'm thinking of thee now;
The holy light of other days
  Is bright'ning on my brow.
I'm roaming thro' thy forests old,
  Where monarch eagles scream,
And now my barque goes bounding o'er
  The Danube's troubled stream.
But, ah! 'tis all a dreamy spell,
  From which I wake to weep,
And find myself an orphan child,
  Far o'er the chainless deep!
    My father-land! my father-land!
      The joys life are o'er,
    My father-land! my father-land!
      I see thy hills no more!

2.
My father-land! the tyrant's chain
  Hath bound thy bleeding form;
Thy fearless sons are swept away
  Amid the battle's storm.
There's blood upon thy sunny plains,
  There's wailing in the air;
And dark foes lie in wait for thee
  As tiger in his lair.
Yet, father-land! one struggle more,
  One more-- my father-land!
A God of justice reigns above
  And cheers thy struggling band.
    My father-land! my father-land!
      The day will come for thee;
    My father-land! my father-land!
      Thy sons shall yet be free!
