1. 
My love she was a bonnie lassie,
I loo’d her frae her moither’s knee
Oh! she was e’en sae gude an’ kind,
I thought that she loo’d me.
We twa children were together,
An’ our hearts sae fu’ o’ glee;
But now mine  wi’ sorrow sickens,
My love’s nae true to me.
But now mine  wi’ sorrow sickens,
My love’s nae true to me.

2. 
Oh! once her e’ fu’ fondly beaming
An’ her young lily bosom swell,
Did whisper gladness to my soul,
Far more than words could tell.
But she’s changed like clouds o’ simmes
Like a roe fled from my side;
My poor heart is almost broken­­
My love’s another’s bride!
My poor heart is almost broken­­
My love’s another’s bride!
