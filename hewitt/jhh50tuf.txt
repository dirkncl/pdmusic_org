1.
Proud land of the freed where the exile seeks rest,
And blesses the flag that waves o'er him;
Where plenty is stewn o'er the earth's verdant breast,
And man sees no danger before him,
The cry of disunion has sail'd on the air,
And traitors thy strong bonds would sever;
The demon of discord has crawl'd from his lair,
While patriots cry "Union forever!"

CHORUS
Then up with our Flag! give its Stripes to the wind,
Its Stars shall be prostrated never!
We'll leave our lov'd homes and their treasures bedind
And fight for the Union forever!

2.
There are hearts at the North that are true to the cause,
The South hath its Patriots undaunted;
The East and the West have their friends of the laws,
Who will always be ready when wanted.
Then, who is there fears for a Union so strong,
That the Federal Compact shall perish?
It shall last, while the sun in its pride rolls along,
And Washington's mem'ry we cherish.

(CHORUS)
