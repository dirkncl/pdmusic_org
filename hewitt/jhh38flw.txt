1.
[Soprano[or Tenor?] 1]
Fair lady! wake, the moon is shining,
Calmly o'er the ripling sea.
[Soprano[or Tenor?] 2]
Here gently on our oars reclining
Lady bright, lady bright,
we sing to thee.

[DUET]
Fair lady, hear our whispering numbers,
Swelling on the midnight air
Like magic stealing o'er thy slumbers,
Prithee wake, prithee wake,
Oh! lady fair,
Prithee wake, prithee wake, oh! lady fair.

[Soprano 1]
The storm bird seeks its rocky home,
Murm'ring billows kiss the shore,
The wave hath lost its crested foam,
E'en the zephyr's sigh no more.

[DUET]
Hark! Hark! hark! hark! it is the merry bell,
[Soprano 1]
Sweetly peeling on the ear,
Sweetly peeling on the ear,
[Soprano 2]
Oh gentle one we bid farewell,
Morning's early blush is near
Morning's early blush is near
Morning's early blush is near.

2.
[Soprano 2]
Sleep, sleep until the golden sun,
Wakes thee from thy visions bright
And dream of us when we are gone,
Lady fair, lady fair,
Good night, Good night.

[Overlappaing voices]
[Soprano 1]
Sleep sleep until the golden sun
Wakes thee from thy visions bright
And dream of us when we are gone,
[Soprano 2]
Good night, Good night, Good night,
Good night, Good night, Good night,

[DUET]
Lady fair, good night, good night,
Good night!
Good night! good night, goon night!
