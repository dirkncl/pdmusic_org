1.
Look from thy lattice gentle lady
  While we touch the soft guitar.
Our barque is on the waters ready
  To be guided by loves star.
Love seeks the moonlight and the billows, 
  When the winds are hushd to sleep.
He loves to breathe on downy pillows,
  Smiling when the dreamers weep.

2.
Oh, do not chide us, gentle maiden,
  If we fill the air with song;
Midnight's breath is sweet when laden
  With the notes that float along.
Then, ere we leave thee, wake and listen,
  Let our simple music tell
How bright the eyes with tear-drops glisten,
  When the lips breath "fare thee well!"
