1. 
Oh! I have a lover, a diffient man, 
He starts at the sight of a bon-net or curl; 
And stammers as badly as any one can, 
When he tries to converse with a gi-gi-gi-girl. 
He once took a seat near a rod from my side, 
And, while twirling his cane and biting his glove, 
He stammer’d out something that sounded like “bride,” 
And, fell into fits when he sigh’d l-l-love.

2. 
His pride and his courage at length came to aid, 
And his mode of attack was decisively plan’d; 
“I've been thinking, sweet wife,” almost fainting he said, 
“If I dared to take hold of your ha-ha-ha-hand!” 
I gave him my hand, and he squeezed it outright, 
Such boldness I never beheld in my life; 
He was soon at my feet, and I laughed at his sight 
When, half frantic he call’d me his wi-wi-­wi wife!
