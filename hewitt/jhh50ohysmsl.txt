1.
O have you seen my spanish lady,
The dark eyed and blushing?
Her lips are ever gently smiling,
And sweets from them gushing.
She strikes the trembling mandolina,
And sings the song I love to hear;
And when she dances the Getina,
Oh, ev'ry step to me is dear.
  Yes, yes, yes.

2.
O I dearly love my Spanish Lady,
I know she loves me too;
She cannot ask a single favor,
That I won't agree to.
She says I am too young to marry,
And think I'll make a pretty page;
If I my father's shield can carry,
She need not think about my age.
  No, no, no.
