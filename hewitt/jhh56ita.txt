1.
I'm thine alone, though other hearts may claim
  My wand'ring thoughts, this heart will turn to thee;
At early morn, or evening's quiet time,
  Its secret beatings thine alone shall be.
When pleasures twine bright visions round my way,
  And Joy illumes my soul's most secret shrine,
When mirth's rich voice may round my footsteps play,
  Still I am thine, beloved only thine.

2.
Or when afflictions heavy wing o'ershades
  The light that dwells within that heart of thine;
When from the rosy cheek the young light fades,
  I'll own thee still, and whisper, thou art mine.
Then, when thou wanderest in a far off land,
  Let me but know thy thought doth turn to me;
That the communings of thy heart will blend,
  At morn, at evening, with my soul's to thee.
