1. 
Far, far o’er deserts wild and dreary, love, 
Where rugged nature bars our way; 
Where savage foemen crouch in darkness, love, 
And shun the open light of day; 
There, with a bold and feerless trooper band, 
I'll think of those I’ve left behind, 
And wing a faithful lover’s kiss to thee, 
My darling Jane­­ the true and kind. 

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
The sword of vengence will flash in the fight, 
And Custer’s name shall be the cry. 
Breathe thou, my love, an angel’s prayer for me, 
And shed a tear if I should die.

2. 
A soldier’s life is full of anger, love, 
And I may never hear again 
The loving words oft whisper’d in my ear, 
The sad farewell that gave me pain. 
But thou shalt be the spirit of my dreams, 
My guardian angel in the fight. 
True to the last, my heart shall cling to thee, 
My darling Jane­­ a sweet good night.
