1.
Mary, now the seas divide us,
Dost thou think of me?
Who that e'ver ador'd could chide us
Or my love for thee?
False to all the vows spoken
False to thine own heart
E'er the chords which thou hast broken
Still their joys impart.

2.
When with pensive ray the moonlight
Sleeps upon the Sea,
Mellow'd by the sad'ning twilight,
Comes thy form to me.
Then I think of our first meeting,--
Twas a happy day.
Then I dream of moments fleeting,--
Moments pass'd away.

3.
Now alas! I weep in sorrow
All my joys are gone
Not one beam illum's the morrow
Those fond hopes are flown!
In the halls of beauty shining,
There thou walk'st the Queen;
I in solitude reclining
grieve o'er all that's been.

4.
Dost thou ere recall our parting
On this lonely shore,
When the pearly tears were starting,
Tears unknown before?
Ah! the vow there then did'st waken
Perish'd with thy sigh,
Here I'm left to mourn forsaken,--
Would that I might die!
