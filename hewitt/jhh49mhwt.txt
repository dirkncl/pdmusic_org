1. 
My heart’s with thee, my heart’s with thee; 
Where  e’er my wand’ring foot steps go, 
My heart’s with thee, my heart’s with thee, 
O’er many fields or treach’rous sea; 
When waves dash high and wild winds blow, 
Still must its deepest pulses glow, 
My heart’s with thee, my heart’s with thee!

2. 
My heart’s with thee! my heart’ with thee!
It ne’er has changed thro’ good or ill,
My heart’s with thee! my heart’ with thee!
Tho’ foes assail thee bitterly--
Wounding the flow’r they cannot kill;
Mine is the joy to love thee still--
My heart’s with thee, my hear’ with thee.

3. 
My heart’s with thee! my heart’ with thee!
There’s nought on earth it loves so well,
My heart’s with thee! my heart’s with thee! 
Its only joy is thine to be--
The lyre impassion’d cannot tell,
How wild for thee its pulses swell--
My heart’s for thee, my heart’s for thee.
