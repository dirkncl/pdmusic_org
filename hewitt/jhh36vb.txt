1.
Have you seen the pretty Ellen?
She was call’d the village belle;
Eyes a thou-sand secrets telling,
Though her lips had none to tell.
Zephyr’s woo’d her silken tresses,
Stole the honey from her lips
As the bee each flow’r caresses,
While in sparkling dew it dips,
  As the bee each flow’r caresses,
  While in sparkling dew it dips.

2. When she spoke, ’twas music trembling
On the wind-harp’s mystic string;
Eve-’ry word a note resembling,
Bourne upon a cherub’s wing,
In the dance’s airy measure,
Who so light­­ so proud as she?
Eyes that beam with youthful pleasure,
Swimming with the melody,
  Eyes that beam with youthful pleasure,
  Swimming with the melody,

3.
Many lov’d the pretty Ellen,
Smiles she had for every one;
But her heart still freely swelling,
Own’d an ardent pulse for none.
All was joy and sunshine round her,
Like a thing of light she mov’d;
Every coming morning found her,
Still unloving, though belov’d,
  Every coming morning found her,
  Still unloving, though belov’d.
