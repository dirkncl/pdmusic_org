1.
Down in yonder silent vale,
Where softly breathes the summer gale,
And cooing ring doves tell their tale,
  A cottage may be seen;
The tinkling of the cattle's bells,
Its quiet and its comfort tells;
But there's a pretty fairy dwells,
  Her name is Lizzie Gree.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Sweet Lizzie Green, my charming Lizzie Green--
But there a pretty fairy dwells,
Her name is Lizzie Green.

2.
Let cities boast their splendid belles,
One in that humble cottage dwells,
Whose eye a warmer story tells
  Than any courtly queen's;
Oh! would you see an eye whose ray
Will light you on a heav'n-ward way;
And turn grief's midnight into day?
  That eye is Lizzie Green's.

3.
I've lov'd her since I was a child;
My boyish passion grew more wild
The more she gazed-- the more she smiled;
  And now she's just sixteen;
I would not have her older grow,
But always let her be just so,
'Till I became a proper beau
  For my sweet Lizzie Green.
