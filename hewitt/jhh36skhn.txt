1.
She knew him not-- or seem'd to shun
  His fix'd and srdent gaze;
Her heart and soul seem'd bent upon
  The dance's giddy maze.
Her soul was melting in her eye,
  While music fill'd the air;
She seem'd to have no memory,
  of blissful days that were.

2.
She knew him not-- long years of grief,
  Had circled round his brow;
Their hour of love was sweet as brief,
  But dear to memory now.
'Twas but a transient tast of bliss,
  A dream on beds of flowers;
A short farewell-- a hurried kiss,
  One gleam of sunny hours.

3.
She knoew him not-- her lips wore smiles,
  That seem'd a burning wreath;
Yet, like the ice-drop in the sun,
  They glow'd, tho' cold beneath.
I thought I saw in every glance,
  The liquid sorrow start;
And, though she sought the brilliant dance,
  'Twas with a broken heart.
