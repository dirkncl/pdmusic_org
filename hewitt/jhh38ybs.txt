Ye burning stars! bright jewels of the night!
Send forth your streams of pure and silv’ry light
Glare proud-ly through the depths of mellow blue
And yield new lustre to the crystal dew.
Stars that are dancing lightly,
Sing in your orbits nightly,
Ne’er could ye beam more brightly,
More beautiful than now
Stars that are dancing lightly,
Sing in your orbits nightly,
Ne’er could ye beam more bright-ly,
More beautiful than now.
Oh! how purely gleams
Thy radiance round the crown of night,
As if the realm of dreams
Were made of moons and planets bright.
Stars that are dancing lightly,
Sing in your orbits nightly,
Ne’er can ye beam more brightly,
More beautiful than now.
Pearly stars illume night’s brow
illume night’s brow illume night’s brow
illume night’s brow illume night’s brow.
Illume night’s brow illume night’s brow.
