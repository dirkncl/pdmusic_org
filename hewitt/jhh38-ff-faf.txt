1. 
[SOLO, Flora (Soprano)]
Cheerily thy bugle sounds, 
When home returning o’er the lake; 
Merrily my bosom bounds, 
As each clear swell bids echo wake. 

[Solo, Forester (Alto [Tenor?]]
Joyously I wind the note, 
To tell thee that thy hunt er’s near; 
Merrily I speed my boat 
T’ wards the place by thee made dear. 

[ACCOMPANIMENT CHORUS with overlapping voices 
for both SOLOS with each Verse]
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, al, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, 
La, la, la. 

[Forester and CHORUS, sung after each ACCOMPANIMENT CHORUS]
Flora for thee, thee only, 
These mountain wilds are sweet to me; 
Each crag and valley lonely, 
Is blest because ’tis loved by thee; 
Sound, sound, sound, 
sound the merry, merry mountain horn 
At evening’s close, 
At morning’s early dawn.

2. 
[SOLO, Flora]
Fearlessly thy footsteps roam, 
When snow hangs on the dizzy steep; 
Driving from its rocky home, 
The echo of the hollow deep. 

[SOLO, Forester]
Merrily the wild stag bounds, 
Until he feels the hunter’s spear; 
Cheerily the glen resounds 
With chorus and the hunter’s cheer.
