1.
Over the sea, the bright sunny sea, 
Charley my lover is coming to me; 
Blow gentle gails, fill out his sails; 
Charley, my sailor boy’s out on the sea. 
Then the storm raves over the wave, 
And the wild seagull shrieks loud in the foam; 
Over the deep I gaze while I weep, 
And pray that my lover may safely come home.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Over the sea, the bright sunny sea, 
Charley my lover, is coming to me; 
Blow, gentle gales, fill out his sails; 
Charley, my sailor boy’s coming to me.

2. 
Happy I’ll be, when safe o’er the sea, 
With a glad heart, he come faithfull to me; 
Sweet birds will sing­­ glad bells will ring, 
Welcome to Charley, safe over the sea. 
No more to roam far from his home, 
No more to toss on the wild rolling sea. 
Happy the hours will pass amid flowers, 
For Charley, my darling, will share them with me.
