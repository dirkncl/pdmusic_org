1. 
My bark has plow’d the stormy sea,
And borne me far away;
My soul was dark, I thought of thee,
My own­­ my dearest May.
In foreign lands I heard the song
Of birds and rippling rills;
They only made my spirit long
For my home among the hills,
My home among the hills.

2. 
I’ve mingled with the joyous train
In hills that blaz’d with light;
But smiles and music were in vain,
My thoughts to thee took flight.
No smile so sweet as thine, my May,
With joy my soul it fills;
The silent night I sigh away
For my home among the hills,
My home among the hills.

3. 
No songs are like the songs of home.
They charm the eager ear,
And seem to say­­ “Lone wand’rer come,
We’ll make you happy here!”
Oh, give me back my own sweet May,
My vales with murm’ring rills;
My life with her shall glide away
In my home among the hills,
My home among the hills.
