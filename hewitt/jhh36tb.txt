1.
The last -- the last faint sound I hear,
  Of groom and bride departing,
With lady bright and cavalier,
  And helms in sunlight darting.
Along I sit and think of one,
  The nobliest knight of all,
Who left his faithful love alone
  To bow to honor's call.
    He said he'd come at even tide,
    And claim his lady for his bride.

2.
They're gone -- they're gone now down the vale
  Their plumes are faintly streaming,
Their banners flap the evening gale,
  No sunlight on them gleaming.
The night bird now begins to sing,
  And star by star appears --
Each silent planet wondering
  Why I should be in tears!
    Why comes he not at eventide,
    To claim his lady as his bride.

3.
Be still -- be still, my throbbing brest,
  I hear a bugle sounding;
I see a warrior's snowy crest --
  A war steed proudly bounding.
He comes -- I know his gallant mien,
  His helmet, sword and spear;
I know him by his doublet green,
  My own brave cavalier!
    True to his word at eventide,
    He's come to claim me as his bride.
