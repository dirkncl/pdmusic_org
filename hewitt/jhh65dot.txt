New Ballad
"Dreaming of Thee" (1865)
Words by J. Dickson Bruns, M.D.
Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1808-1890

1.
The twilight hath died on the shore.
  The winds are asleep on the lea;
And the lavish night shakes from her prodigal store,
  A shower of gold o're the sea;
Whose deep bosom moves to the moon that she loves.
  And I, love, am dreaming of thee;
Whose deep bosom moves to the moon that she loves.
  And I, love, am dreaming of thee;
    Dreaming, Dreaming, dreaming of thee,
    Dreaming, dreamer, dreaming of thee.

2.
There's a cloud in the glooming West,
  That will crimson to blood with the day,
And red-handed Mars shales his fiery crest,
  While Orion goes down to the fray.
And his [falchion?] and shield gleam bright o'er the field
  Where I, love, am dreaming of thee--
    Dreaming, Dreaming, dreaming of thee,
    Dreaming, dreamer, dreaming of thee.

3.
Ah! Heaven! for one hour of rest--
  One sweet, short hour to be
Where my love lies couched in her mountain nest,
  'Neath you star that is trembling with glee--
Lies hushed in her nest, my babe on her brest,
  And perchance is dreaming of me--
    Dreaming, Dreaming, dreaming of thee,
    Dreaming, dreamer, dreaming of thee.
