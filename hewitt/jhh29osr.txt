1.
Oh! soon return, my hours are lonely,
When thou’t gone from me,
My bosom beats fro thee, thee only,
Fond and fervently.
Can’t I e’er forget, love;
How in you we met love;
When moonbeams bright illumed the night,
And sparkled on the sea.

2.
Oh! soon return, no star can glisten
Half so purely bright,
As when I fondly turn to listen
To thy voice at night.
When the moonbeams shine, love,
Hearts like thine and mine, love,
Should fly to meet in bondage sweet,
And mingle in delight.
