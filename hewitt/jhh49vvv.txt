1.
I am the very pink of beaux,
  _Au fait_ in form and feature;
The ladies cry "ah! there he goes,
  The dear, delicious creature."
At balls and fetes I'm quite the thing,
  No lady's glance is icy,
My motto always has been this,"
  "Veni-- vidi-- vici,"
My motto always has been this,"
  "Veni-- vidi-- vici,"

2.
I curl my moustache with such grace,
  And pout my lip so sweetly,
That love seems beaming from my face,
  And girls are _done_ completely.
They say my smile is killing, quite,
  My wit is rare and spicy--
It matters not where I may be--
  "Veni-vidi-- vici."
It matters not where I may be--
  "Veni-vidi-- vici."

3.
The proudest beauties of the town
  Have own'd my facination;
My winning ways have "done them brown,"
  I've conqur'd all creation!
Then, ladies, -- you must all give up,
  There's no chance for you-- I see; 
Surrender at discretion, girls,
  "Veni-- vidi-- vici."
Surrender at discretion, girls,
  "Veni-- vidi-- vici."
