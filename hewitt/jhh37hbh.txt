1.
Hark! brothers, hark! the evening gun,
  (Pull away steadily all pull cheerily,)
Booms from the land at set of sun,
  (Pull away steadily all pull cheerily,)
Bend to your oars, for the night breeze will soon
ripple the waves in the silvery moon,
      So happy are we,
      And feerless and free,
Pulling our Boat o'er the moonlit sea.

CHORUS
So happy are we,
And fearless and free,
Pulling our Boat o'er the moonlit sea.

2.
Pull away, boys with main and might,
  (all pull readily -- pull, mates cheerily)
Looks that we had are here to night,
  (Pull, brothers, steadily -- all pull merrily)
One boat, like a sea-bird, skies swiftly along,
To the dip of our oars and the chime of our song,
      So hearty we be,
      And jovial and free,
Pulling away o'er the dark blue sea.

CHORUS
So hearty we be,
And jovial and free,
Pulling away o'er the dark blue sea.

3.
Ladies at best held landsmen cheap,
  (Pull, lads, readily -- all pull merrily)
Beauty's smiles are for sons of the deep;
  (Pull, boys, steadily -- all pull cheerily)
And beautiful eyes -- let them say what they will,
Beam ever brightest on blue-jackets still;
      So happy and free,
      And gleesome are we,
Pulling our best o'er the tranquil sea.

CHORUS
So happy and free,
And gleesome are we,
Pulling our best o'er the tranquil sea.

4.
Merrily, when we reach the shore,
  (Pull away readily -- all pull cheerily)
A can will drain to the lads of the oar;
  (Pull, boys, steadily -- all pull merrily)
And frolic and fun shall be ours, till we
Are bounding again o'er the dark blue sea;
      So happy are we,
      So fearless and free,
Pulling our best o'er the moonless sea.

CHORUS
So happy are we,
So fearless and free,
Pulling our best o'er the moonless sea.
