1.
The bugle sounds upon the plain,
  Our men are gath'ring fast;
You would not have your friend remain,
  And be among the last.
Cheer up, cheer up, my Southern flow'r,
  There's joy for you and me--
While Right is strong and God has pow'r,
  The South shall rise up free!
    While Right is strong and God has pow'r,
      The South shall rise up free!

2.
When by the campfire's fitful light,
  Beneath the starlit sky,
I picture scenes of young delight,
  Your form shall hover nigh.
Your smile will cheer the lonely hour,
  Your eye my loadstar be,
For well I know while God has pow'r,
  The South shall rise up free!
    For well I know while God has pow'r,
      The South shall rise up free!

3.
When to the field of fight I rush,
  And raise my battle shout,
A soldier's pride each doubt will hush,
  Though bullets fly about.
I'll boldly face the leaden shower,
  And trust to Destiny;
For Right is strong and God has power--
  The South shall rise up Free!
    For Right is strong and God has power--
      The South shall rise up Free!

4.
Our Stary Cross flaunts in the air,
  And guides each soldier on;
Where'er it shines our braves are there,
  Unflinching, every one.
Then cheer up, cheer up!--Southern flower,
  There's joy for you and me;
For Right is strong and God has power--
  The South shall rise up Free!
    For Right is strong and God has power--
      The South shall rise up Free!
