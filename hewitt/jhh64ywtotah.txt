1.
Yes, we think of thee at home,
  Oh, we often think of thee,
In the fullness of our grief,
  In the moments of our glee,
The same pulse beats as when,
  Thy steps were turned to roam;
The same lips breathe thy name,
  As we think of thee at home.

The same lips breathe thy name,
  As we think of thee at home.

2.
Yes, we think of thee, when night
  Spreads its shadow o'er the earth,
When thy song fell on our hearts,
  And thy merry laugh of mirth;
Oh! how can we forget,
  Though sears between us foam,
The look that seemed to say--
  "Dear ones! think of me at home."

The look that seemed to say--
  "Dear ones! think of me at home."

3.
Yes, we think of how thy love,
  In early days was told,
And thy farewell vows to us
  Were more precious far than gold;
Once more be by our side,
  And never, never roam,
For bless'd will be the day,
  That shall see thee safe at home.

For bless'd will be the day,
  That shall see thee safe at home.
