1.
Oh give me the mountains
Where in childhood I rov'd;
The streamlet and fountains,
That my young fancy lov'd,
The cottage where daily,
Joy's smile might be seen,
The throng that danced gaily
To the sweet mandolin.

2.
I've rode the wild billow,
When the tempest was high;
I've mourn'd o'er the pillow,
Where my buried friends lie.
One memory still flourish'd
Above all the rest
My home fondly cherish'd
And the friends I love best.
