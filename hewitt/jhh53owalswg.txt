"Oh! While Adown Life’s Stream We Glide" (24 May 1853)
    To my Wife, whose similar smiles have ever
    cheered me in hours of gloom and sadness,
    This little token of love, these words of the
    heart are affectionately inscribed.
By J. Fred. Simmons

1.
Oh! while adown life's stream we glide,
  In sunshine’s smiles or wintry weather;
Still, let us journey side by side,
  And sweetly live and love together.
Lock’s in each others fond embrace,
  Though dark and dismal clouds hang o'er us,
With hearts united we may face
  Each threat'ning storm that looms before us.

2.
This bosom is a kingdom fair,
  And it will be the home of pleasure,
Whil’st thou shall be sole empress there,
  And sway thy sceptre without measure.
Then as we journey down life's stream,
  Devoted fondly to each other;
Oh! ours shall be a blissful dream,
  For, still we'll live and love together.
