1.
My southern home, where skies are bright, 
And balmy winds are blowing, 
Though exiled, still my heart is thine, 
And tears for thee are flowing. 
A friendly refugee alone, 
Thro’ stranger lands I wander, 
And sadly beats my patriot heart 
When o’er thy fate I ponder.

REFRAIN
My southern home, my sunny home,
When shall I rest with thee?
Not till thy galing chains are cleft,
And thou standst proud and free.

2.
My southern home where warm heart beat,
And maids are fair and truthful;
Where mothers’ rear up hardy sons,
And valor crowns the youthful.
The refugee will pray for thee
Until his life-scene closes;
He ne’er may see thy shore again,
Thy hills and vales of roses.
