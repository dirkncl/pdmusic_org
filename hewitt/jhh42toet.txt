1.
Under the shade of this old elm tree,
We’ll laugh and play right merrily;
In days of yore beneath its shade,
Our sires their infant gambols play’d.

Under the shade of this old elm tree,
We’ll laugh and play right merrily,
In days of yore beneath its shade
Our sires their infant gambols play’d,

They laugh’d and sung, and so do we,
Under the shade of this old elm tree,

They laugh’d and sung and so do we,
Under the shade of this old elm tree.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ho! ho, ho, ho,
Ha! ha, ha,
Under the shade of this old elm tree.
Ho! ho, ho, ho,
Ha! ha, ha,
Under the shade of this old elm tree.


2.
Under the shade of this old elm tree
We’ll sing our native melody;
Beneath its giant arms once stood
Our land’s first Chief­­ the brave and good,

Under the shade of this old elm tree
We’ll sing our native melody;
Beneath its giant arms once stood
Our land’s first Chief­­ the brave and good,

He spoke of victory to the free,
Under the shade of this old elm tree.

He spoke of victory to the free,
Under the shade of this old elm tree.

3.
Under the shade of this old elm tree
Our sons shall wrestle manfully;
And our daughters dance, and sing, and play,
For, who so gay, so proud as they?

Under the shade of this old elm tree
Our sons shall wrestle manfully;
And our daughters dance, and sing, and play,
For, who so gay, so proud as they?

They are the children of the free,
And honor the shade of the old elm tree.

They are the children of the free,
And honor the shade of the old elm tree.
