1.
The moon beams are kissing the waves of the sea,
  And the morning's light trembles afar.
Then look from thy lattice fair lady on me.
  And list to my gentle guitar;
I'll tell the how fondly I love the mild ray
  Of thy blue eye when turn'd upon me.
I'll tell thee of charms that I worship by day,
  Of nights that I dream [tured?] thee.

2.
They [sneer?] at romance but a moonlight like this,
  Attunes the young bosom to love;
The heart that is warm is as eager for bliss
  As the plannets to wander above --
Thru shone the bright stars with the light of thine eye,
  And smile the glad wavelets to sleep;
The still breeze will pause as it catches thy sigh,
  Then bear the rich shore o'er the deep.
