1.
Father, look up and see that flag,
  How gracefully it flies;
Its pretty stripes they seem to be
  A rainbow in the skies.
"It is your country's flag, my son,
  And proudly drinks the light,
O'er ocean's wave in foreign climes,
  A symbol of our might."

2.
Father what fearful noise is that
  Like thundering in the clouds?
Why do the people wave their hats
  And rush along in the crowds?
"It is the boom of cannonry,
  The glad shouts of the free;
This is the day to memory dear;
  'Tis Freedom's Jubilee."

3.
I wish that I was now a man,
  I'd fire my cannon too,
And cheer as loudly as the rest
  But, father why don't you?
"I'm getting old and weak, but still
  My heart is big with joy;
I've witnessed many a day like this--
  Shout ye aloud, my boy."

4.
Hurrah! for Freedom's Jubilee,
  God bless our native land;
And may I live to hold the sword
  Of Freedom in my hand!
"Well done, my boy, grow up and love
  The land that gave your birth;
A home where Freedom loves to dwell
  Is paridise on earth!"
