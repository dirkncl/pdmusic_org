1.
The Cavalier rode on his coal black steed,
Nor forests, nor [siredoms?] could his course impede;
Three long years had pass'd since the blissful hour,
He kiss'd a fair hand in yon lordly bow'r.
The war-din was o'er the trumpet was mute,
And no sound could he hear but the notes of a lute.
He rein'd up his steed, and soon was the fall
Of his heavy foot heard in the Castle hall.
  Fairest and fondest! thy soft voice I hear,
  'Tis bliss to the heart of thy young Cavalier.

"Oh, haste ye away!" cried the lady in fear,
"My bridal feast's o'er and my lord is near;
"They said that you fell on the field of the slain,
"That I never, oh! never should see you again?
"Thou false one! tis done," the cavalier cried,
"Fame's laurels, I've won -- there's honor for me.
"But my harvest of glory is never for thee.
  "Fairest and falsest! the moment is near,
  "When vengeance shall come from the true Cavalier!"

3.
He sought the proud lord where revelry rung,
Where nobles pledged high and gray minstels sung,
And straight on the floor his gauntlet he threw,
'Mid the scornful laugh and the loud halloo.
The gauntlet was seized, and the bridegroom proud
Found his nuptial garments his funeral shroud--
The bright morning dawn'd -- the Knight was away,
And his steed prick'd his ears when he chanted his lay--
  "Fairest and falsest! thou'st nothing to fear,
  "The Camp is the home of the true Cavalier!"
