1.
Days of childhood! Days of childhood!
  Where are your pleasures gone?
Yon babbling echo answers - where?
  And I am left alone.
My young companions, where are they?
  They sleep among the dead,
Or else are scatter'd o'er the world,
  To mourn the joy that's fled.

2.
Days of childhood! Days of childhood!
  I can but think of ye -
The many pranks I used to play
  In youthful buoyancy.
The cottage where my parents dwelt,
  The valleys which I ranged;
The budding lips I used to kiss,
  Ah! now how scar'd and chang'd.

3.
Days of childhood! Days of childhood!
  Old age has little joy;
I've now a care for every bliss
  I had when but a boy.
The wor;d looks cold and drear to me,
  I used to think it bright;
I must regret the morn, until
  I bid the world good night.
