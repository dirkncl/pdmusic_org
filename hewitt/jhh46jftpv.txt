[BASS SOLO]
Joy flies the peaceful valley, 
Glad voices ring no more; 
Death claims its tender victim, 
Where’s our triumph now? 
Best be, lov’d of   Juda’s daughter’s; 
Go, mourne among the mountains; 
Tell the flow’rs of thy sorrows, 
Weep in the valley stream.

[SOPRANO SOLO] 
With thee go a virgin band, 
Those who love thee best; 
Companions of thy youthful hours— 
When thy sky was bright. 
Echo will answer our wail, 
And the stars will silently list to our song of woe, 
Angels bright will hear our pray’rs, 
And wipe the tear away, 
And wipe the tear away.

[DUETT]
Maid of Judah!
Thine is an early doom;
Maid of Judah!
Thine is an early doom;
But give thy heart to God,
But give thy heart to God,
O give thy heart, thy heart, to God,
Thy heart to God,
Thy heart to God,
But give thy heart, thy heart to God.
Seek the hills bewailing,
Where the flow’rs are sleeping;
Let thy sighs be heard in heav’n,
Thy pray’rs recorded there,
Oh mourning child of heav’n,
Oh mourning child of heav’n, mourning child,
Oh! child of heav’n.
