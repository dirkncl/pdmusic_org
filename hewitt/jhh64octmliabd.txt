1.
Oh, come to me love, in a beautiful dream,
When fairies are kissing the waves of the stream,
And laughing 'mid moonbeams that gladden the night.
They sport round a dew drop so sparkling and bright.
The harp of the winds shall awaken its strain.
The hollow shell answers its mystic refrain
While the stars shall peep out from their chambers of blue
And wink at each other when looking at you.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then come to me love, in a beautiful dream,
When fairies are kissing the waves of the stream,
And laughing 'mid moonbeams that gladden the night.
They sport round a dew drop and drink in its light.

2.
The roses that pout with their lips of soft red,
Shall hang in rich coronets over your head;
The lilies that send out their odor so sweet
Shall bow their pale heads at your fairy-like feet.
And when I have whisper'd my love o'er and o'er
And knelt at the feet of the maid I adore
I'll look in your mild eyes to see if they speak
The truth that is told by the blush on your cheek.
