1.
I'll twine a laurel wreath,
Around the soldier's brow,
Who carv'd his name upon the field
Where silence hovers now,
And he shall sleep on flow'rs
And dream the dream of joy,
All honor to the brave and true,
The gallant soldier boy,

[CHORUS]
Then twine a laurel wreath,
Around the soldier's brow,
Who carv'd his name upon the field
Where silence hovers now.

2.
No more the trumpet sounds,
No more the cannons roar;
The smile of peace beams o'er the land,
Dispelling clouds of war;
Then rest thee, soldier, rest,
The sweets of home enjoy,
There's not a lady in the land;
But loves the soldier boy.

(CHORUS)
