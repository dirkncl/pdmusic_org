1.
'Twas a calm, still night, 
And the moon's pale light, 
Shone soft o'er hill and vale, 
When friends mute with grief, 
Stood around the death bed, 
Of my poor lost Lilly Dale. 

CHORUS 1
Oh, Lilly, Sweet Lilly, dear Lilly Dale, 
Now the wild rose blos-soms o'er her litltle green grave, 
'Neath the trees in the flow'ry vale.

2.
I've been to the East, 
I've been to the West, 
I've been to old Virginia 
Of all the negers I like the best 
It is my lovely Enny. 

CHORUS 2
On, Enny, oh, Enny oh my lovely Enny. 
Of all the negers I like the best 
It is my lovely (It is my lovely) Enny.
