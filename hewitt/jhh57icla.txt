1.
I cannot love another,
  For, when in youth we met,
The flame I tried to smother,
  Lives in my bosom yet.
Tho' other hands caress thee,
  And other hearts are thine;
No other lips can bless thee,
  With warmer prayers than mine.

2.
My last fond hope has perished,
  Another is thy bride;
Her every smile is cherished,
  And she is by thy side.
Her jealous eye turns on me,
  A look of haughty scorn;
And thou art wont to shun me,
  While I am living on.

3.
Farewell, farewell, forever!
  But sometimes think of me;
The links I cannot sever
  That bind my heart to thee.
Be happy with thy treasure,
  The idol proudly won;
Be life a scene of pleasure,
  'Neath Joy's unsetting sun.
