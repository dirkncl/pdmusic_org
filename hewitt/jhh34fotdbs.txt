"Far O'er the Deep Blue Sea" (1834)
Words by R. H. Pratt Esq.
Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
The moon is beaming brightly love,
  Upon the deep blue sea--
A trusty crew is waiting near,
  For thee, dear girl, for thee!
Then leave thy downy couch, my love,
  And with thy sailor flee;
His gallant bark shall bear thee safe,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea.

2.
The storm-bird sleeps upon the rock--
  No angry surges roar--
No sound disturbs the slumb'ring deep--
  Not e'en the dipping oar;
No watchful eye is on thee now,
  Then, dearest, be with me,
And share a daring sailor's love,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea.

3.
She comes! she comes: with trembling step--
  Oh! happy shall we be--
When safely moor'd, on other shores,
  From ev'ry danger free!
Now, speed thee on my trusty bark,
  Our hopes are all on thee--
Bear, bear, us to our peaceful home--
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea,
  Far o'er the deep blue sea.
