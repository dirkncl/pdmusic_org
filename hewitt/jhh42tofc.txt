1. 
Our home has more charms than the courts of the great,
’Tis a palace to us tho’ lowly our state;
It is bless’d with a smile of contentment so Sweet,
And the merry laugh rings when happy friends meet.
Around the gay hearth there are clustering joys,
Our rosy cheek’d girls and our golden hair’d boys
But the old oaken clock, as it stands ’gainst the wall,
with its hourly peals gives a warning to all.
With its click! click! click click, it seems, it seems to say
That every thing Cherish’d is passing away
Passing Passing Passing away.

2. 
For years has it stood, where it now lonely stands,
Proclaiming the hour with its chime and its hands;
The old and the young hear it pealing away
The burden of Time decay all decay
Our ancesters reck’d not its tones clear and deep
For the grave was not form’d where their reliques now sleep
Now the young hear its chime and the dull cadence mock
They heed not the voice of the old oaken clock
with its click! click! click! click! it seems it seems to say,
That That every thing cherish’d is passing away
Passing Passing Passing away.
