1.
I leave your sun-bright isle,
  To bound a-cross the sea,
And dream of eve-ry smile
  That fond-ly beam'd on me.
I care not where I go,
  O'er snow or burn-ing soil;
Still, still my heart shall glow,
  For yon-der sun-bright isle. 

CHORUS [after each Verse]
The sun-bright isle! 
The sun-bright isle,
For yon-der our bright isle,
For yon-der sun-bright isle.

2.
Your qui-et vales and hills,
  Ah! can they be for-got?
The woods and gush-ing rills,
  The pil-grim's rest-ing spot.
Bright eyes may greet me home,
  And man-y a ma-gic smile;
Yet, yet, wher-e'er I roam,
  I'll bless your sun-bright isle.

3.
My course is o'er the sea,
  Our sails are spread a-new;
The wind's soft mel-o-dy,
  Is still your sad "a-dieu;"
A-dieu! my lips re-ply,
  My heart beats sad the while;
Hush'd by your eve-ry sigh,
  Peace to your sun-bright isle!
