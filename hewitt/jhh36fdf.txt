1.
Father land! dear father land!
Home of ev'ry pleasure;
Can I cease to cherish thee
Mem'ry's dearest treasure!
Far away from all I love,
wand'ring like the restless dove,
Stranger smiles are all I see,
Coldly beam such smiles on me.
Our native songs to mem'ry dear,
No more the cheering strains I hear,
  Ai ye o.

2.
Father land; dear father land!
Vales and craggy mountains,
Where the gallant hunter boy,
Greets the chrystal fountains.
Here are vales and mountains too,
Flow'rs that drink the limped dew;
Hearts that swell for liberty,--
Still, they have no charms for me
Our native songs to mem'ry dear,
I cannot sing them freely here,
  Ai ye o.
