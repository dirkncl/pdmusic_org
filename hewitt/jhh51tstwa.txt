1. 
They said thou wer’t another's,
That on thy finger shone
The ring that erst he gave thee,
To claim thee as his own.
Oh, is it so? I ask thee
To utter with thy lips
The doom of him who loves thee,
Be't sunshine or eclipse.
The doom of him who loves thee,
Be't sunshine or eclipse.

2. 
I saw thee 'midst the gay ones,
The brightest of them all;
And when I took thy fair hand,
To lead thee thro' the ball,
Oh! then the words of passion
Came burning from my tongue;
The joy of my existance
Upon thy answer hung.
The joy of my existance
Upon thy answer hung.

3. 
But if thou art another's,
Why trifle with a heart
Whose pulse is thine, thine only,
Whose fount of joy thou art?
O tell me-- tell me truly
If thou art doom'd to be
The treasure of another,
The star that's less to me?
The treasure of another,
The star that's less to me?
