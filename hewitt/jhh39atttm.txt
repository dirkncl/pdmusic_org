1.
Away then to the mountains,
While the morning sun is shining;
The mist has left the fountain,
And the herds in shade are reclining.

Up the rocks we'll climb To the top sublime,
And we'll watch the light deer bounding;
While the Sun wades through the Sea of blue,
And the Alpine horn is sounding,

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Away then to the mountains,
While the mourning sun is shining;
The mist has left the fountains,
And the herds in shade are reclining.

2.
The hunter dreads no danger,
While along the steep locks wending;
From youth a mountain ranger,
With the wind and snow contending.

From the peak he looks On the valley brooks,
While his heart for home is bounding;
And he marks the maid On the valley glade,
Who lists to this wild horn sounding,
