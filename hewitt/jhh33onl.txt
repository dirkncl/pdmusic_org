1.
Our native land! Our native land!
  For thee, thou lustre of the world!
Still firm united shall we stand,
  With sabre drawn and flag unfurl'd
The legacy our fathers left,
  By Freedom sanction'd, still is ours
Nor shall our noble tree be reft,
  While ev'ry branch is dress'd in flowers!

REFRAIN and CHORUS
Huzza! Huzza! sons of the free!
  Strike, strike, strike the bolt from Treason's hand,
For God, for Fame and Liberty,
  For Union and our Native Land!

2.
Our Country dear ... Our Country dear!
  Shall Faction spurn thy holy laws?
Shall Freedom's sword and Freedom's spear
  Be wielded in disunion's cause?
Thy fairy fields, shall they be stress'd
  With brothers slain by brother's hand?
Shall fathers raise their arms of blood
  Against the ensign of our land?

(REFRAIN and CHORUS)

3.
Our starry flag! Our starry flag!
  Whose eagle sits enthroned in light,
Shalt thou not wave o'er hill and crag,
  Triumphant in the hour of fight?
Let him who swells Rebellion's cry,
  In civil strife, once turn to thee,
A Patriot's tear will fill his eye,
  His bright sword strike for Liberty!

(REFRAIN and CHORUS)
