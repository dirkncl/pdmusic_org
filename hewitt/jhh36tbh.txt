1.
What wild sound is filling the narrow glen,
  And stealing o'er the lawn?
'Tis the shout of Saluda's merry men,
  With their cheering bugle horn.
    The bugle horn! The bugle horn!
  The anxious and keen-scented hound,
  Now wildly responds to the sound,
  The moss cover'd rocks in reply
  Send back the elfin melody.

2.
Now swift the woodlands the proud stag bounds,
  And greets the dewy morn;
But as swift the tracks of the eager hounds,
  While shrill sounds the bugle horn.
    The bugle horn! the bugle horn!
  The glen with wild melody rings,
  Each man to his proud charger clings;
  And ere the bright sun blazes high,
  The panting stag must surely die.
