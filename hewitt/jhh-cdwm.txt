1.
Come dwell with me, my sweet Jannet, 
Down by the spring where first we met; 
Close by there stands­­ deep in the grove, 
A cottage made for hearts that love. 
There have I lived since boy-hood's days; 
By moth-er's loved­­ by father praised; 
They both will smile on you, my pet, 
My mountain maid­­ my sweet Jan-net. 
They both will smile on you, my pet, 
My mountain maid­­ my sweet Jan-net.

2.
Though rough and rant the hunter's fare, 
Yet sweet content is smi-ling there. 
The monarch sun will rise and set 
On once full hearts; my blithe Jannet. 
Joy shall be ours the whole day long; 
The woods and rocks shall learn our song. 
Then, dwell with me, my darling pet, 
And be my bride,­­ my dear Jannet. 
Then dwell with me, my darling pet, 
And by me bride­­ me sweet Jannet.
