[Recit.]
My father, if thou hast
opened they mouth unto the Lord,
do to me according to that which hath proceeded
from thy mouth;
for as much as the Lord hath taken
vengence for thee
of thine enemies
even of the children of Ammon
Let this thing be done for me;
Let me alone two months
that I may go up and down
up on the mountains,
And bewail my fate
I and my fellows.

[Aria]
Cease, troubled bosom, cease,
Sad heart be lull'd in peace;
Life's but a gleam of light,
And death a calm and tranquil night,
a calm, a calm, and tranquil night.

Lo! how the flower fadeth,
when eve its beauty shadeth.

Cease, troubled bosom, cease,
Sad heart be lull'd in peace;
Life's but a gleam of light,
And death a calm and tranquil night,
a calm, a calm, and tranquil night.

Scenes I've lov'd so long,
Ye birds with tuneful song;
Cool fount and shady dell,
Companions, fare ye well!

Cease, troubled bosom, cease;
Sad heart be lull'd in peace;
Life's but a gleam of light,
And death a calm and tranquil night,
A calm, a calm, and tranquil night;
Then, fare ye well, we meet no more,
The joyous light of life is o'er,
Then, fare ye well, we meet no more,
The joyous light of life is o'er.
