"Annabel Lee" (1887)
Words by Edgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849
Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
It was many a year ago,
In the kingdom by the sea,
That a maided lived, which you knew
By the name of Annabel Lee.
And this maiden she lived with no other thought,
than to love and be loved by me--
Then to love, then to love,
then to love and be loved by me.

2. [CHORUS]
I was a child and she was a child,
In the kingdom by the sea;
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
And an my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphys of heaven
coveted her and me, her and me,
her and me, coveted her and me.

3.
And this was the reason that long ago
In the kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee,
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre dark,
In the kingdom by the sea.

4. [CHORUS]
The angels not so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me,
Yes, that was the reason, as all of you know,
In the kingdom by the sea,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
chilling and killing my Annabel Lee,
Annabel Lee, Annabel Lee,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

5.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever deliver my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
Of the beautiful, of the beautiful,
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

6. [CHORUS]
For the morn ever beams without bringing my dreams
Of beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of beautiful Annabel Lee.
And so all the lifetide, I lie by the side
Of her tomb by the sounding sea,
sounding sea, sounding sea,
Her tomb by the sounding sea.
