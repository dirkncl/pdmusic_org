1.
Where spicy winds kiss eastern shores,
And fervid sunbeams glare
Where mighty Ganges onward roars,
Our flag is there huzza! Our flag is there!
Where Hecla belches out its fires
Upon the trembling air,
And tinges ranks of icy spires,
Our flag is there, huzza! Our flag is there
  Our flag is there, huzza! Our flag is there!

2.
Lo! where the ocean’s surgy wave
Drinks in the lightning’s glare,
And mocks the thunder bolts that rave­­
Our flag is there, huzza! our flag is there.
Look north, and south, and east, and west,
Its stripes float in the air,
Reflected from the water’s breast,
Our flag is there, huz-za! our flag is there.
  Our flag is there, huzza! our flag is there.

3.
Where booming Cannon tell the world
What perils freemen dare,
What gallant sign is that unfurl’d?
Our flag is there, huzza! our flag is there,
Where states are bound in un-ion strong,
And glad songs fill the air,
The land by Freedom’s cherish’d long,
Our flag is there, huzza! our flag is there.
  Our flag is there, huzza! our flag is there.
