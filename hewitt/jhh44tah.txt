1.
Hear ye the Alpine horn,
  Sweetly it sounds
While breaks the rosy morn,
  And the roe bounds.
Gaily its music
  On the air thrills,
It speaks in the valley
  The voice of the hills.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Ai ye ho &c.

2.
Up to the mountain brow,
  Down in the vale,
O'er beds of trackless snow,
  Breasting the gale;
See the young hunter,
  Seeking his game;
No ice-cliff nor torrent
  His spirit can tame.
