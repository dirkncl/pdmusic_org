1.
Look up on that banner! oh, see it proudly fly;
The foemen are gath'ring the battle strife is nigh.
Hark! hark! I hear the bugle; again its warlike blast;
One kiss, boy embrace me, perchance 'twill be the last.
  One kiss, boy embrace me, perchance 'twill be the last.

REFRAIN
Justice is our motto out country always right;
Go shield her - sustain her, or perish in the fight,
Go shield her - sustain her, or perish in the fight,

2.
Look up on that banner, it is Columbia's pride --
'Tis glory to guard it __ 'neath it have hero's died:__
Those stars so brightly beaming__ no light can shine like them__
Those strips so proudly streaming, from Glory's diadem!
  Those strips so proudly streaming, from Glory's diadem!

(REFRAIN)

3.
Then on to the battle, where glory waits ye now__
Her garlands she's wearing to crown each soldier's brow;__
Again! the trumpet's sounding__ no longer boy delay__
With hearts with hopes rebounding, let every son obey!
  With hearts with hopes rebounding, let every son obey!

(REFRAIN)

4.
When homeward returning, all fresh from Glory's fight,
The country shall greet thee, and hail thee with delight__
But should the gallant soldier, in deadly conflict fall,
With laurel and cypress, we'll dedeck his funeral pall.
  With laurel and cypress, we'll dedeck his funeral pall.

(REFRAIN)
