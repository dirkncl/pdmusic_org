1. 
When the moonbeams glance upon the river, 
When the zephyrs press the dewy flow’rs; 
When the mocking bird is sadly singing 
In the foaming all around your bow’rs; 
Then I’ll row  my skiff across the waters, 
And beneath your window sing my lay. 
While the night winds pause awhile to listen, 
And the moon goes, smiling, on her way.

Refrain [sung after each verse]
Sweet Rosabel, how I have lov’d you. 
My lips have not the pow’r to tell; 
But, ask the stars, they oft have heard me 
Sigh, Rosabel, dear Rosabel!

2. 
When the golden sunbeams kiss the hilltops, 
And the birds sing love songs in the grove; 
I will wander near your rosy bower 
And repeat the tale of faithful love. 
There’s a beach tree just beyond the gateway, 
Where  we met and sighed a sad adieu; 
On its back I’ve carved the words “Forget not, 
And be ever to your lover true.”
