1.
March on, march on! death or victory, 
Is the only battle cry for him who would be free. 
March on, march on­­ death or victory, 
Is the everlasting song of human liberty! 
Halt not, fear not­­ Glory leads the way; 
Courage, courage t'ward a brighter day. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
March on, march on, death or victory, 
Is the only battle cry of him who would be free.

2.
Hope on, hope on, though the sky be dark, 
Yet the flood will cease to pour, the dove will leave the ark; 
Fight on, fight on! 'til your cause is won, 
And all foes of Liberty are crush'd beneath the sun. 
Down with all tyrants be they priest or king. 
Break ev'ry fetter, give the soul free wing.

3.
Brave hearts, brave hearts, great deeds have been done. 
Old Thermopylae­­ the plains of Marathon;  
Swiss Alps re-echo the name of William Tell, 
And Winkelried's great heart received the lances as he fell. 
Strike home, strike home, Bruce of Bannockburn, 
Strike as our Washington did Kingly pow'r spurn.
