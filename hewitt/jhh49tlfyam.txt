1.
There is dew for the flow'ret,
  And honey for the bee;
And bowers for the wild bird,
  And love for you and me!

There are tears for the many,
  And pleasure for the few;
But let the world pass on, dear,
  There's love for me and you!

2.
There is care that will not leave us,
  And pain that will not flee;
But on our hearth unaltered
  Sits love, 'tween you and me!

Our love, it ne'er was reckoned,
  Yet good it is and true;
It's half the world to me, dear,
  It's all the world to you!
