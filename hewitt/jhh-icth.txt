1.
I'll count the hours until we meet, 
  For, dearest one, with thee 
They hurried on like coursers fleet, 
  But now they laggards be. 
I'll count the hours of every day­­ 
  That holds us thus apart, 
And shun the light that sheds no ray 
  On my o'ershadow'd head.

2.
The hours of every night I'll count, 
  The heartthrobs of my breast 
Up to a fever pulse will mount 
  In counting my un-rest. 
But when we meet, that envious elf 
  Who does me thus ensnare, 
Old Time, may count the hours himself, 
  I'll never count nor care!
