To Miss Fanny Waldron, "Queen Sisters"
"You Are Going to the Wars, Willie Boy!" (1863)
Ballad
by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
You are going to the wars, Willie boy, Willie boy,
You are going to the wars far away,
To protect our rights and laws, Willie boy, Willie boy,
And the banner in the son's golden ray;
With your uniform all new,
And your shining buttons too,
You'll with the hearts of pretty girls,
But none like me so true.
Oh! won't you think of me, Willie boy, Willie boy,
Oh! won't you think of me when far away?
I'll often think of ye, Willie boy, Willie boy,
And ever for your life and glory pray.

2.
You'll be fighting for the right, Willie boy, Willie boy,
You'll be fighting for the right and your home;
And you'll strike the blow with might, Willie boy, Willie boy,
'Mid the thundering of cannon and drum;
With an arm as true as steel,
You'll make the foemen feel,
The vengence of a Southener,
Too proud to cringe or kneel.
Oh! should you fall in strife, Willie boy, Willie boy,
Oh! should you fall in strife on the plain,
I'll pine away my life, Willie boy, Willie boy,
And never, never wear a smile again.
