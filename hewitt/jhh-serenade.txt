1.
Star of the evening, beautiful star!
Shining so brightly in realms afar!
Watch o'er the cherish'd one while she sleeps;
Gently, gently weep in her dreams.
Kiss of the teardrops when she weeps,
Star of the evening! Kiss with thy beams.

CHORUS [after 1st and 2nd Verses]
Lady sleep, lady sleep, sleep while we sing;
Dream of love, dream of love,
Night's on the wing.
Morning's ray, morning's ray
Soon will appear,
Think of us, sweet lady, think of us, sweet lady,
Think of us when far away.

2.
Sweet smiling sound [S[T? or L?] ounal?], queen of the night,
Silent and pallid, sinks out of sight;
Morning comes peeping up in the west,
Softly, softly spreading her light.
Star after star, love, goes to rest;
Star of the evening! Tell us "goodnight."

3.
Over the water gently we glide
With our gay gondola, cleaning [leaving?] the tide,
In the dim light of the morning moon,
Softly, gently, o'er the lagoon
List! dearest lady, while we sing,
Morning is nearing-- Night's on the wing.

CHORUS [Refrain] [for 3rd Verse only]
Lady fair, lady fair, list while we sing.
Smile on us, smile on us--
Night's on the wing.
Morning's ray, morning's ray
Soon will appear,
Think of us, sweet lady, think of us, sweet lady,
Think of us when far away.
