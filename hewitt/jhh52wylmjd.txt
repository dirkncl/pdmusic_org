1.
Will you love me, Jennie dear?
Whisper gently in my ear;
Tell me will you love me true,
Just as I love you.
Tell me with a beaming eye,
Tell me with a half drawn sigh;
Swear it by yon orb above,
Jennie will you love?
Jennie, will you love me?
Jennie, will you love?

2.
I have lov’d you, Jennie dear,
When the forest leaves were sear;
I have lov’d you when the flow’rs
Bloom’d around you bow’rs;
Fortune’s smiles were nought to me,
Your’s alone I hop’d to be;
From your presence ne’er to rove
Jennie, will you love?
Jennie, will you love me?
Jennie, will you love?

3.
Then be mine, my Jennie dear,
When the flow’rs of spring appear,
When the groves are gay with song,
And the laughing throng.
Do not turn your head away,
Whis-per soft the happy day
Evry fearful doubt remove
Jennie, do you love?
Jennie, do you love me?
Jennie, will you love?
