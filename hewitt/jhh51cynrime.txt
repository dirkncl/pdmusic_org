1.
Can you not read in my eyes, as we turn,
The thoughts which just now in my bosom burn?
Or fear you to look-- lest there you should see
The dear little angel so cherish'd by me?
Dearest, look up and turn not away
The glance of that eye which is brighter than day.

Still let the music so sweetly swell on,
There's a spell that seems mingling two hearts into me;
Still but the music so sweetly swell on,
There's a spell that seems mingling two hearts into one.

2.
Now, while I hold your light form in my arms,
I feel your hand tremble-- what mean these alarms?
I've not told my love, but I certainly will
If the waltz does not stop and the music be still.

Lady! don't sigh, when smiles so abound,
And love seems to feed on the sweet viol's sound,
Still let the music so sweetly sweel on,
There's a spell that seems mingling two hearts into one!
