The idea of the first strain is taken from a French melody. J.H.H.

1.
Blow warder blow thy brazen horn,
The champion of the cross is near;
His gallant charger tramps the lawn,
And brightly shines his massy spear.

He safe returns from Palestine
His sword is red, bruis’d is his shield;
No more shall he in shackles pine,
No more traverse the gory field,
Then merrily the harp shall sound,
The halls with costly feats shall shine;
Then warder send the signal round,
Thy knight returns from Palestine.

2.
The warder blew a quiv’ring note,
It echoed o’er the waving brake
And swiftly sped the champion’s boat
Thro’ the bright waters of the lake.

The lady rush’d to greet her lord,
And fondly in his arms she fell;
He kiss’d her neck of snowy white,
For then he knew she lov’d him well,
Now merrily the bells do ring,
And brightly cross and banner shine;
The minstrels strike their harps and sing,
The noble knight from Palestine.
