No. 1 [some lyrics were illegible]
I’m Captain Jack of the Modec tribe, 
The thieving band; 
I’m somewhere Yankee dogs are 
And am sure to hold the scalp their heads in the lava beds, 
And make them feel quite qualmy; 
It’s go on the for I am chief of this army. 
So whoop! hunter! for the Mocking bird 
Its bursting shrieks can't harm me. 
I'll whipfull double my weight and size; 
With my red skin Modec army. 

[There was no No. 2]

No. 3
Ya, ya, ya bring the knife and tomahawk. 
Ya, ya, ya let us go get white 
Ya, ya, ya bear to scalp and hair and heads, 
Ya, ya, ya fight  ing in the beds 

No. 4
I'll sing you a song of a general bold, 
Viva la compani, 
His merits in poetry cannot be told, 
Viva la compani 
Viva la, viva la, vival'a mour 
Vivala, viva la, viva l'a mour 
Viva l'amour 
Viva l’a mour 
Viva la compani.

[No. 6] [most lyrics were illegible]
And don't boiling pot. 
Down, down below down below. 
All de time it's 
Dat's de place ... for you. 

No. 7
Down, down below the fire is blazing, 
Make up, O sinner, and repent, 
Or else you'll find the heat amazing, 
And for your soul I would nt give a cent. 
Down, down below the fire is burning. 
Make up, O sinner and repent. 

No. 8
We've all gone out apoaching, 
The enem's ap proaching, 
Upon our line's encroaching, 
To let us halt a bit. 
We're rather in a plight. 
Whether to run or fight. 
Oh what a situation 
for an army of the nation, 
All bother and vexation 
and I can't better it.    

No. 9
I'm not dead, it was a hum, 
Nor am I my ducky 
One more glass of gin or rum 
I’m in time, that’s lucky, 
Here I am upon my pegs, 
Ready for a stumblin’, 
I’ll discard my wooden legs, 
And take another bruizing. 
Yankee doodle, rule the west, 
Don’t mind indian yelping; 
This army is the nation’s best, 
And not afraid of scalping.
