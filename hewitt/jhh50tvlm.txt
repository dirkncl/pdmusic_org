1.
There was a little maid
Who wore a little bonnet,
And she had a little finger
With a little ring upon it;
She screw'd her little waist
To such a little size
That it made her little blood
Rush to her little eyes.

[Refrain] [sung after each verse]
Oh! This charming little, winning little, very little maid;
This very, very, very little maid.

2.
This pretty little maid
Had a pretty little beau;
Who wore a little hat
And gloves as white as snow.
He said his little heart
Was in a little flutter;
That he lov'd the little maid,
And no one else but her.

3.
She smiled a little smile,
When he breathed his little vows;
And he kiss'd her little hand,
With many little bows.
By little and by little
Her little heart did yield;
'Till little tears and sighs
Her little fears reveal'd.
