1.
[BOTH VOICES]
Hark­­ hark! hark!­
­Tis the Alpine horn. 
Thro’ yonder dark val-ley it swells, 
Thro’ yonder dark val-ley it swells. 
On­­ on­­ on­
To the mountains on! 
Thro’ forest and rocky dells, 
Thro’ forest and rocky dells. 

[VOICE 1]
Hi-li-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. 
[VOICE 2]
And bright eyes burn, 
When we safe return 
To the home where our lov’d ones sigh. 

[VOICE 1]
We fearless roam by the torrents foam 
And climb to the sum-mit high. 
[VOICE 2]
Hi-li-hi-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

[BOTH VOICES]
Hark­­ hark! hark­­ 
Tis the echo sprite 
From mountain to mountain it flies. 
From moun-tain to mountain it flies. 
On­ on­ on­ While the morning’s light, 
Is gilding the eastern skies, 
Is gild-ing the eastern skies. 

[VOICE 1]
Hi-li-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. 
[VOICE 2]
The prize lies low, 
And the shout below,  

[VOICE 1]
Now welcomes the hunter  back. 
The tramp we hear of the mountain dear, 
As it flies o’r its rocky track.
[VOICE 2]
Hi-li-hi-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
