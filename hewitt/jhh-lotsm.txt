They've left the mountain, left the vale
Where once they dwelt in peace;
Their last farewell swells on the gale,
And now its accents cease.
Oh! Alpine home! thou't silent now,
Thy notes are heard no more
The echo sleeps on mountain brow,
Thy song of you is o'er
Now in a foreigh land they dwell,
Far from their fatherland.
They sigh to mountain joys farewell
before the ocean strand.
Where Freedom glads the soul of men,
The Switzer makes his home,
Then can he sing his Alpine song
And never wish to roam,
Then can he sing his Alpine song
And never wish to roam.
