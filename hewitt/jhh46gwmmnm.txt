1. 
Go-- we must meet no more, 
Fate has ordain’d it so; 
One look and all is o’er, 
One last farewell-- then go. 
But when amidst the gay, 
Warm smiles are greeting thee; 
Still hear me trembling say 
"Wilt thou remember me?" 
Still hear me trembling say 
"Wilt thou remember me?" 

2. 
Go-- thou hast never lov'd 
Falsehood is in thy smiles; 
Vain have the efforts prov'd 
That led me to thy toils. 
Oft when the twilight gray 
Steals o'er the waveless sea; 
Let mem'ry turn this way, 
Think-- and remember me. 
Let mem'ry turn this way, 
Think-- and remember me.

3. 
Go-- there are brighter eyes
Beaming in foreign lands;
Lips stored with luxuries,
Light forms and tender hands.
When other lips shall tell
Tales of their love for thee;
Think of our last farewell--
Think-- and remember me.
