1. 
Oh! sweet Kitty Neal, rise up from your wheel;
  Your neat little foot will be weary with spinning;
Come, trip down with me to the Sycamore tree,
  Half the parish is there, and the dance is beginning.
The sun is gone down, but the full harvest moon,
  Shines sweetly and cool on the dew whiten'd valley,
While all the air rings with the soft loving things,
  Each little bird sings to the green shaded alley.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Och! home! Sweet Kitty Neal!
Och! home! Sweet Kitty Neal.

2. 
With a blush and a smile, Kitty rose up the while
  Her eye in the glass, as she bound her hair, glancing;
'Tis hard to refuse when a young lover sues,
  So she could'nt but choose to go off to the dancing,
And now on the green the glad groups are seen,
  Each gay hearted lad with the lass of his choosing,
And Pat without fail leads on sweet Kitty Neal,
  Somehow when he asked she ne'er thought of refusing.

3. 
Sweet Kate! who could view your bright eyes of deep blue
  Beaming humidly through their dark lashes so mildly;
Your fair turned arm, heaving breast, rounded form,
  Nor feel his heart warm and his pulses throb wildly?
Poor Pat feels his heart, as he gazes, depart,
  Subdued by the smart of such painful, yet sweet love;
The sight leaves his eye as he cries with a sigh,
  "Dance light, for my heart it lies under your feet, love!"
