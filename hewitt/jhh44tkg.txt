1.
They're sung of English gentlemen,
Who liv'd in olden times,
When titles [losed?] and made of arms,
Had multitudes of crimes,
My theme shall be a gentleman,
The father of the West ...
A man of intellect and soul,
With a kind heart in his breast.

REFRAIN
The fine Kentucky gentleman,
Whose heart is in his hand;
The rare Kentucky gentleman,
The noblest in the land.

2.
The minstrels of long bygone days,
Whene'er they [tamed?] their lyres,
Were sure to sing of warlike deeds,
Young heroes and their sires:
I sing in praise of him who stood
Erect in Senate hall
Amid the proudest of the land,
The proudest of them all!
