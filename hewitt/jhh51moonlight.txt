1. 
Twilight sheds its glimering ray,
On mountain peak afar;
In the mist of dying day,
Behold the verper star.
Silent up the eastern sky,
Asray'd in beams of silvery  white;

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Oh! gentle moon, we welcome thee,
Fair princess of the night.

2. 
Woods and dells are glooming fast,
And birds have hush'd their song;
Far the mountain shadow's cast;
So gloomy and so long.
'Tis the hour when fairies play,
They love thy pale and mellow light;
