"Darling, Tell Me Yes"
(circa 1825-1890)
Words by John G. Lasce
Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
One little moment more, Maud;
  One little whisper more;
I have a word to speak, Maud,
  I never breathed before.

What can it be but love, Maud?
  One word of nightly guess,
'Tis pleasant to your eyes, Maud?
  O, darling, tell me yes.

CHORUS
O, darling, tell me yes,
  Tell me, tell me yes;
O, darling, tell me yes.
  Tell me, tell me, yes.

2.
The burden of my heart, Maud,
  There's little need to tell,
There's little need to say, Maud,
  I've lov'd you long and well.

There's lanquage in a sigh, Maud,
  One meaning to express;
And your's was it for me, Maud?
  O, darling, tell me yes.

(CHORUS)

3.
My eyes have told you my love, Maud,
  And in my burning cheek
You've read the tender thought, Maud,
  My lips refused to speak.

I gave you all my heart, Maud,
  'Tis needless to confess;
And, did you give me yours, Maud?
  O, darling, tell me yes.

(CHORUS)

4.
'Tis sad to starve a love maud,
  So nourished and so true;
I know a little cot, Maud,
  Quite large enough for two;

And you will be my wife, Maud?
  So you may ever bless,
Through all you sunny life, Maud,
  The day you answer'd yes!

(CHORUS)
