To Miss Fanny Fowler, of Baltimore
"The Dying Girl" (1852)
Written & Composed by
John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

----=*=----
  These simple lines were suggested by the death of Miss Helen
Helmond of Washington City, on the 3rd of May, 1848, and were
the fulfillment of a promise which she exacted from the author
while living, that he would remember her in poetry when dead.
She was lovely and amiable; just blossoming into life and fall
of happy anticipations. The May festivities were looked forward
to with youthful joys for, had not death seal'd her lips, she
would have sung with the youthful choir so innocently celebrate
the reign of Flora and the advent of the season of flowers.

1.
They say I'm falling fast, mother, indeed I feel it [as?];
For all seems overcast, mother,
And my cheeks have press'd to glow;
Just place your hand near to my heart,
How wild it pulses beat!
They'll soon be still, I know they will,
And thru my sleep how sweet.

2.
Oh! raise me in your arm mother,
That I may catch the breeze;
And feel its breath of life, mother,
Fresh from the leafy trees,
The flow'rs are full of life and joy;
How rich the lilacs bloom;
And see my rose - how sweet it blows,
You'll bear it to my tomb.

3.
'Tis merry May for some, mother,
Their joyous laugh I hear,
With happy songs they come, mother,
Those songs to me how dear!
Oh, let them sing them by my bed,
I'm sure 'twill seethe my pain;
'Twill hover round me when I'm dead,
They wild yet pleasant strain.

4.
The light becomes more dim, mother,
I cannot see your face!
My brain begins to swim, mother,
My limbs grow cold apace;
An angel's bending from the skies,
He says that I must come,
Oh! mother dry your tearful eyes;
I'm going to my home.
