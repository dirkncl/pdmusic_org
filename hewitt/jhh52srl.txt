1. 
Sweet Rosa’s lips are red.
Her nose is crimson too,
And when she goes to bed,
But head to foot she’s blue.
Her hands are lily white,
Her cheek’s like snow I ween.
Her eyes are black and bright.
From head to foot she’s green;
Yes, from head to foot she’s green,
From head to foot she’s green.
She’s green. She’s green,
She’s green. She’s green.

2. 
Miss Rosa has a beau!
The dandy of the town,
His hair is silver gray,
Although his name is Brown.
He loves her for her cash,
For she the gold can clink;
All brown, a brown, a brown, a brown. 
Although he is her Brown
He’s still a perfect pink.
Yes he is perfect pink.
He is a perfect pink!
A pink, a pink! a pink! a pink!
