1.
When Freedom from her dazzling home,
Look'd down upon the breathing world,
She saw amid the misty gloom,
The banner of man's rights unfurl'd.
A light flash'd thro' the sombre cloud,
The despot's stunning voice was dumb;
While sovreign man spoke out aloud
And rattled Freedom's Muster Drum.

CHORUS
The drum! the spirit stirring drum!
They burst their chains -- they rise ... they come!
It speaks aloud stern Freedom's ban,
And gives the world the rights of man.

2.
Then Freedom spoke in cheering strain,
"The air, the earth, the sea are thine;
Dash to the dust the galling chain
That binds a soul God made divine.
Give to the breeze thy warlike cry,
And rive the helm of hireling scum;
Than live a slave, 'twere best to die
While rattling Freedom's Muster Drum.

(CHORUS)
