1.
Linger not long! home's sad without theem
  Its dearest tokens make me mourn.
Let mem'ry be a chain about thee,
  Gently to hasten thy return.
Linger not long, tho' woo'd to staying,
  Oh! can the mirth of friends, tho' dear,
Pay for the grief thy long delaying
  Costs the fond heart that woos thee here!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Linger no long! Linger not long!

2.
Linger not long! I'll watch thy coming
  As evening spreads o'er moor and dell
When the wild bee has ceased her humming,
  And silence weaves her gloomy spell.
I'll watch for thee when fear grows stronger,
  As night creeps darker o'er the hill;'
I'll weep, when I can watch no longer,
  And art thou absent, dearest, still?

3.
I should not grieve-- tho' eyes that seeth me
  Look on thro' tears that make light dull;
For, oh! I fear, when thou art with me
  That pleasure's cup is all too full.
Oh! haste thee to thy mountain dwelling,
  As birds fly to their peaceful nest;
Haste as the skiff-- when storms are swelling,
  Flies to its quiet cove of rest.
