1.
Good night my love, when you reprove, 
'Tis surely time to go; 
But, time's swift flight, with love at night, 
We lovers never know. 
You say­­ depart, while my poor heart 
Keeps urging my to stay, 
'Till, 'twixt the two, what I must do 
I find it hard to say. 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Good night, sweetheart,­­ one little kiss; 
The stars are not too bright; 
They will not see­­ so one­two­three! 
Good night, sweetheart, good night.

2.
The sighing breeze through leafy trees, 
Says­­ linger yet awhile; 
The stars shine bright through ebon night, 
And seem on us to smile. 
The nightingale down in the vale, 
Is warbling­­ do not go, 
While every flow'r that loves your bow'r, 
Seems chiding you with "no."

3.
Oh, I could say "good night" 'till day 
Peeps up the east-ern sky; 
And hail the sun that beams upon 
My lingering goodbye. 
And, oh, the bliss of each new kiss 
That fills one with delight. 
Frown if you will­­ I'll linger still 
To sigh­­ sweetheart, good night.
