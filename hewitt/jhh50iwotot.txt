1.
I will often thing of thee,
And pleasant visions raise
Of the spells that came o'er me
In other happier days,
When the hearts were pass'd as if each one
Were but a mirror in the sun,
Turning back the dazzling light
It sheds upon the surface bright.

2.
I will often think of thee,
When stars are in the skies;
And the billows of the sea
Sing spirit melodies,
When the glen is still, and not a note
Comes from the forest songster's throat,
To dispel the mystery
That hangs around sweet thoughts of thee.

3.
I will often think of thee,
When in the dazzling halls;
When 'mid laugh and melody
Time's footstep heedless falls,
When amid the throng moves not the one
Who first my young affection won,
I will turn away to be
Alone alone in thought with thee.
