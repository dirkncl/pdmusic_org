1.
This world is coming to an end,
  Few day's, few day's!
I'll [crack?] my [shins?], my Jacket [wind?]
  I'm g'wine home.
I'm gwine to run clear out o' sight,
  Few day's - few day's!
And leave these naughty diggins quite;
  I'm gw'ine home!

CHORUS
For I've got a home out yonder,
Few day's - few day's!
I've a home out yonder, in old Tennessee,
And I can't stay in these diggins,
Few day's - few day's!
Can't stay in these diggins,
I'm gw'ine home.

2.
They tell about Maine Liquor Law,
  Few day's - few day's;
It makes the folks get drunk the hours;
  I'm gwine home.
Nebraska's gwine to be a State;
  Few day's, few day's;
Cuba, too, will come in late,
  I'm gwine home.

(CHORUS)

3.
Every thing is [done?] by storm,
  Few day's - few day's;
Leather taffy -- chalk Ice Cream,
  I'm gwine home.
Deys wear beards and Women too,
  Few day's - few day's;
Though all things change, there's nothing new;
  I'm gwine home.

(CHORUS)

4.
The Shanghei fowls so tall they grow,
  Few day's - few day's;
That people cannot bear them crow,
  I'm gwine home.
When guano's put on gudgeon's tails,
  Few day's - few day's;
They grew to be as big as whales
  I'm gwine home.

(CHORUS)

5.
There's sin and folly every where,
  Few day's - few day's;
Enough to make old [pain stare?],
  I'm gwine home.
I'll sing my parting song once more,
  Few day's - few day's'
And then I'll pass o'er Jordan's shore,
  I'm gwine home.

(CHORUS)
