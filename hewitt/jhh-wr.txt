1.
[SHE] 
I'm off to the club Mister Muggins tonight. 
You see, if you please if ev’rythings right.  
[HE]
Oh, yes, me dear love be assured I’ll attend 
To our dear little babe their stockings I’ll mend. 
[SHE]
And mind you have ready a cup of strong tea. 
[HE]
By all means my love, depend upon me. 


DUETT [repeated after each verse]
[SHE]
You’re a nice little man, and when I come home, 
I’ll bring a boil’d lobster, and you shall have some. 
You’re a nice little man, and when I come home, 
I’ll bring a boil’d lobster and you shall have some. 
[HE]
You’ll a nice little wife, and when you  come home 
You’ll bring a boil’d lobster and I shall have some. 
You’re a nice little wife and when you come home, 
You’ll bring a boil’d lobster and I will have some.

2. 
[SHE]
Tomorrow I’ll sit on the jury to try, 
A case of divorce of Bly versus Bly. 
[HE]
How proud I will be Misses Muggins to see 
My amiable spouse seated  with the jury! 
[SHE]
Perhaps we’ll be hung, and can never agree. 
[HE]
I hope ’twill be so that I may be free. 

3. 
[SHE]
I’ve got my speech ready­­ ’tis strong for our rights, 
Upholding the blacks and degrading the whites. 
[HE]
I’d like much to  hear it­­ But, then there’s the rub, 
The clothes must be washed that are now in the tub. 
[SHE]
That’s right, my dear Muggins, your duty you know. 
[HE]
To smile when I’m peck’d by the old mother crow.
