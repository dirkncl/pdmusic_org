"Dreaming Forever of Thee" (1875)
Words and Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming forever of thee,
Morning, eve-ning, whether on land or on sea.
Whatever land I may roam, love.
Still my heart beats for my home, love.
Thee, love, thee, love, still I am dreaming of thee.

2.
Starlight, starlight, brings thy dear image to me,
Sunlight, sunlight, finds me still thinking of thee.
E'en in the hall of the gay, love,
Let pleasure smile as it may, love,
Thee, love, thee, love, still I am longing for thee.
