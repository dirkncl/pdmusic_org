Written, Composed & Dedicated to

1.
A lady sat mute in her bow'r,
While her page from the turret on high,
Look'd out at the lone midnight hour,
To see if her lover was nigh.
"Ho! ho!" said the page, as he toss'd
His scarf 'mid the moon's mellow light,
"A horseman the meadow has cross'd,
And his corslet and helmet are bright.

[REFRAIN]
Lady fair! Lady fair! banish thy gloom
For here is the Knight of the raven black plume.
Lady fair! Lady fair! banish thy gloom
For here is the Knight of the raven black plume.

2.
The lady arose from her seat,
And through the light lattice she spied
A horseman careering full fleet
Along the dark rivulet's side,
And soon 'neath the Battements high,
The notes of a shrill bugle rang;
And she wept, but she could not tell why,
While thus her young troubadour sang.

"I come from the field of the slain,
The meed of the tournament's mine;
Yet, never a smile could I gain,
So dear to my bosom as thine!"
The Warder then open'd the gate,
And the halls with high revelry rang;
For long did the fond lovers prate,
While the minstrels in joyous notes sang --
