1.
'Tis long ago, when hope was high, 
And health and wealth were mine;  
Then happiness seem'd in my grasp,
So young I felt, and fine,
A little maid possess'd the heart
Which I could not retain;
The world entire was centred in
My own dear Ellen Vane,
The world entire was centred in
My own dear Ellen Vane.

CHORUS 1
My own dear Ellen Vane,
My own dear Ellen Vane;
The world entire was centred in
My own dear Ellen Vane.

2.
Her form was of as fair a mould!
As Nature ever knew;
A face so full of happiness,
No painter ever drew;
Love nestled in the soft blue eye
Of her without a stain,
It came in words from ruby lips
Of my sweet Ellen Vane,
It came in words from ruby lips
Of my sweet Ellen Vane.

CHORUS 2
Of my sweet Ellen Vane,
Of my sweet Ellen Vane;
It came in words from ruby lips
Of my sweet Ellen Vane.

3.
At last upon her gen-tle brow
The angel plac'd his hand;
Death snatch'd with unrelenting haste
The fairest of the land;
They laid beneath the willow tree
With many a mournful strain
Her, whom no more on earth I'll see;
My dearest Ellen Vane.
Her, whom no more on earth I'll see;
My dearest Ellen Vane.

CHORUS 3
My dearest Ellen Vane,
My dearest Ellen Vane,
Her, whom no more on earth I'll see,
My dearest Ellen Vane.

4.
I wander all the livelong day,
Around my Ellen's grave;
It breaks my heart to see the grass
Above her bosom wave;
And, when I leave this world of woe,
Of sorrow and of pain,
I'll pray that they may lay me low
Beside sweet Ellen Vane.
I'll pray that they may lay me low
Beside sweet Ellen Vane.

CHORUS 4
Beside sweet Ellen Vane,
Beside sweet Ellen Vane,
I'll pray that they may lay me low
Beside sweet Ellen Vane.
