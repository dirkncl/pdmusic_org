"The Bard's Last Song"
(circa 1825-1890)
by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

Harp of my youthful days!
  Forever we part,
Long have I swept thy strings --
  The cords of my heart;
Old age now chills me veins, 
  And snow caps my brow,
Gone is the fire of youth,
  My hand trembles now.
Vainly I try to sing
  The songs of the past;
Tears fill my feeble eyes,
  The strain is the last,
is the last, is the last.

Love was my ardent theme,
  It came from the soul;
Hope cheer'd me as I plead,
  'Neath passion's control.

Love for my native land
  Inspired me song;
Was raged over all the land,
  And struck down the strong;
Firmly by our stormy flag,
  I gather'd the brave.
Singing a requiem over their grave.

Harp of my youthful days!
  Forever we part;
Long have I swept thy strings,
  The cords of my heart.
Old age now chills my veins,
  And snow caps my brow;
Gone is the fire of youth,
  My hands tremble now.

CODA
Brave old harp! fare thee well --
Brave old harp! fare thee well.
Brave old harp! fare thee well --
fare well fare well.
