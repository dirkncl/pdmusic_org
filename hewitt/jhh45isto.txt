1.
I'm still thine own, I'm still thine own, 
  Tho' thou hast wrong'd my trusting heart; 
I see thy coldness every day, 
  And yet confess how dear thou art. 
The flow'r will court the rising sun, 
  Although he steals its dew away; 
So I to thee with fondness look, 
  And wither in thy dazzling ray.

2.
I'm still thine own, I'm still thine own, 
  Tho' thou dost smile on all but me; 
The voice that makes so many proud, 
  To me is rich with melody. 
In courtly halls thou art the star 
  That dims the light of  all the rest; 
And tho' I smile, yet none can tell 
  The grief that struggles in my breast.
