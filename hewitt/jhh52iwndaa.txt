"I Would Not Die at All" (1852)
(Parody on "I Would Not Die in Springtime"
[by Stephen Collins Foster])
by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
I would not die in sprintime
When river shed abound;
And herring cleave the waters,
While flow'rets deck the ground,
When 'sparagus sprouting,
And radishes are red;
When winter, bluster'ring winter,
Hides his diminished head.
I would not die in springtime
When river shed abound,
And herring cleave the waters,
While flow'rets deck the ground.

2.
I would not die in summer,
The sun is far too hot,
And trout and perch are swimming
While crabs are good, I met!
The new mown hay smells sweetly,
And strawberries are nice
When mixed with cream and sugar,
And frosted o'er with ice.
I would not die in summer,
The sun is far too hot,
And trout and perch are swimming
While crabs are good, I met!
 

3.
I would not die in autumn,
When game is on the wing,
And kindly fruits are blushing,
If they could do that thing.
When trees begin to murmur,
And change the garb of green;
There's something sad -- yet pleasant
In each a quiet scene.
I would not die in autumn,
When game is on the wing,
And kindly fruits are blushing,
If they could do that thing.

4.
I would not die in winter,
When sleigh bells jingle round;
And merry girls are laughing,
While lis'ning to their sound.
There's pleasure in the music,
That fills the lighted hall;
I fact, I have concluded,
I would not die at all.
There's pleasure in the music,
That fills the lighted hall;
I fact, I have concluded,
I would not die at all.
