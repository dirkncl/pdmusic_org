1.
We speak of her as on long gone,
A bright star lost from Heav'n;
A faded flow'r-- the pride of morn,
The blasted hope of even.
We used to listen to her song,
And own its magic spell;
But quickly pass'd the spell along--
Lost Rosabel!
But quickly pass'd the spell along--
Lost Rosabel!

2.
How many weary years have pass'd
Since, like a fairy thing
A spell of joy round her cast,
And sounded pleasure's string,
The light that shone upon her brow,
We all remember well--
But where-- oh! where's its brightness now?
Lost Rosabel!
But where-- oh! where's its brightness now?
Lost Rosabel!
