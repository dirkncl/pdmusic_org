1.
Come take the gentle harp of sorrow,
I'll lean it on my beating breast;
Perhaps my lips may smile tomorrow,
And all my fears be lull'd to rest.
Where yonder palm its leaft uncloses,
And spreads it to the dewy shower,
I'll strew for him a bed of roses,
Of jessamine I'll make his bower.

2.
Come then, my harp still wrapt in sadness!
Death long hath clung around thy strings,
Oh! breathe thy wonted notes of gladness,
And give my song celestial wings.
The warlike theme with hurried numbers,
When rolling thunders shake the speres;
The love that lulls to gentle slumbers,
The heart with all its doubts and fears.
