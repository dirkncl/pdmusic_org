1.
The weight of years is on thy crest, 
  Kennesaw, old Kenne-saw, 
While glow the sunbeams in the west­­
  Kennesaw, old, Kennesaw. 
The eagle soars high up in air, 
The panther howls in his dark lair, 
And slyly crawls the serpent there. 
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw.

2.
When War's wild charriot sped along, 
  Kennesaw, olf Kennesaw, 
And brazen war-dogs raised their song­­
  Kennesaw, old, Kennesaw.
Thy gaze was on the battle plain, 
Where 'midst the smoke and leaden rain, 
Contending enemies stove to gain 
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw.

3.
Near by thy base on woody land,
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw!
Our Johnston fix'd his Spartan band, 
  Kennesaw, old, Kennesaw. 
With shout and taunt, and heav-y blow 
Came pouring down the haughty foe,
But, soon their stoutest were laid low, 
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw.

4.
Their graves are in you solitude, 
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw! 
Beneath the sod's stain'd with their blood 
  Kennesaw, old, Kennesaw. 
Near by our gallant soldier's slain, 
O'er them true hearts their vigils keep, 
The while the eyes of Beauty weep 
  Kennesaw, old Kennesaw.
