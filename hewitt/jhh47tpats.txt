CHORUS
Dark wind'd warbler, that's piercing the sky
And hailing the bright rising sun,
Oh, would thro' the ether like thee, I could fly,
And the gloom of this dark prison shun,

1.
Gentle songster, I once was as merry as thou,
But my poor heart with sorrow is sinking now,
well-a-day, well-a-day, ah, well-a-day!

[CHORUS]

2.
'Tis in vain that I plead, they but laugh at my tears,
And my chains are are rust with the weepings of years;
I shall never be free, merry songster like thee,
I shall never be free, merry songster like thee.
