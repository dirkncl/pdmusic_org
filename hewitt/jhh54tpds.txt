1.
Oh! come to my mountain home,
  Maid of the mild blue eye;
Come where the wild deer loves to roam,
  And eagle nests hang on high.
The lillies of thy lovely cheeks
  Will blush when kiss'd by mountain air;
And when thy foot the gray cliff strikes
  Sweet flow'rs will blossom there!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then oome to my mountain home,
Maid of the mild blue eye;
Come where the wild deer loves to roam,
And eagles hang on high.

2.
Far, far from the city's din,
  Vines round a cottage creep.
Peace and contentment dwell within,
  And smiles welcome those that weep.
This quiet home I've built for thee,
  No rude intruder wanders there;
The woods are cheer'd with melody,
  And fragrance fills the air.
