1. 
Oh once I knew a gentle maid,
And took her for my wife;
She came from where the orange grows,
I loved her as my life.
We happy lived no care was ours,
She never caus'd me pain
But on one dark and dreary night,
I lost poor Mary Blane.

[REFRAIN] [repeat after each verse]
Oh! farewell, farewell poor Mary Blane,
One faithful heart still beats for you;
Farewell, farewell, poor Mary Blane,
The fair, the fond and true.

2. 
While through the forest broad I sped
The wild deer's track to gain;
An Indian band our hut assail'd
And bore off Mary Blane.
Long, long I grieved-- and search'd the wilds,
My efforts were in vain;
No one could tell me where to find
My muchloved Mary Blane.   

3. 
I ask'd the eagle as he soar'd
Above the lofty peak,
If he could see my stolen bride,
His answer was a shriek.
I follow'd him when down he plunged
Toward a rocky plain--
And there I saw the whit'ning bones
Of my poor Mary Blane.
