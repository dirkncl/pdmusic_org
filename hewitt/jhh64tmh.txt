1.
Tale me home to the place where I first saw the light,
To the sweet sunny South take me home,
Where the mocking bird sung me to rest ev'ry night,
Ah! why was I tempted to roam.
I think with regret of the dear ones I left,
Of the warm hearts that shelter'd me then,
Of the wife and the dear ones of whom I'm bereft,
And I sigh for the old place again.

CHORUS
Take me home tot he place where my little ones sleep,
Poor massa lies buried close by;
O'er the grave of the lov'd ones I long to weep,
And among them to rest when I die.

2.
Take me home to the place where the orange trees grow,
To my cot in the evergreen shade,
Where the flowers on the rivers green margin may blow,
Their sweets on the bank where we play'd.
The path to our cottage that say has grown green,
And the place is quite lonely around;
And I know that the smiles and the forms I have seen,
Now is deep in the dark mossy ground.

(CHORUS)

3.
Take me home, let me see what is left that I know--
Can it be that the old house is gone?
The dear friends of my childhood indeed must be few,
And I must lament all alone.
But yet I'll return to the place of my birth,
Where my children have play'd all the door;
Where they pull'd the white blossoms that garnish'd the earth,
Which will echo their footsteps no more.

(CHORUS)
