1. 
See the golden star above us.
Printed on the scarlet fold,
Wrought by those who always love us,
Flag of Cuba! fring'd with gold
Come to battle, Southern legions!
Come for Freedom's mane, O come!
Till your tread shall shake the regions,
Where we offer you a home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Flag of Cuba! dipp'd in scarlet
Southern beauties proudly smile
On thy bright and golden starlit,
Floating o'er our sunny isle.

2. 
Monarchs fall and thrones are crumbling,
While we battle to be free,
Freedom's thunders far are rumbling
O'er the land and o'er the sea.
Blood hath reek'd on broad savanna,
Shall that blood flow unredress'd?
Give the breeze our beauteous banner
And the struggle will be bless'd.
