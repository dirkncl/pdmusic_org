"Girls Beware" (1832)
A Ballad.
Written and Composed
by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
|: Girls, beware---shun sly Cupid,
     In his smiles his arrows lie;
   Can you be so dull and stupid,
     As to listen to his sigh? :|
Should you press him to your bosom,
  He will sting you for your pains;
So beware---Hope's young blossom,
  Oft the thorn of Love retains.

2.
|: Men are false, fickle, roving,
     Sighs they have for every one;
   Always, pleading---never loving,
     Tho' they swear their hearts are gone. :|
Sooner would I trust the billow,
  Wand'ring o'er the sunlit sea;
So beware---wreath no willow,
  O'er thy brow's serenity.
