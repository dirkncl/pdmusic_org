1.
Oh I covet not palaces, castles or towers,
Nor the wealth, nor the pomp of the lands o’er the sea;
Give me only a cot deck’d with clustering flowers,
And the bright smiling eyes of my Mary Mary’e.

On a green sloping hill, with a stream by it flowing,
And a porch ’neath the shade of a wide spreading tree;
And the low windows wreath’d with the vines by them growing,
Oh, grant me but these and my Marry Mary’e.

2.
And here in contentment, while time glides away,
Would I mark the sun sink over life’s troubled sea;
With a tear for the wretched­­ a smile for the gay,
And a heart full of love for my Mary Mary’e.

Then come dwell with me in the valley of roses,
There’s a couch for my love ’neath the Magnolia tree,
No harm shall approach, while each beauty reposes,
But Joy’s spirit hover o’er Mary Mary’e.
