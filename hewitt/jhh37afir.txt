1.
Ah! fondly I remember
  Days past and pleasures gone
When longing for life's summer,
  I let her joyous spring pass on
Hope beam'd with smiles before me,
  Joy shed its brightest ray
Heav'n's calmest smile was o'er me
  'Twas childhood's merry day.

2.
Ah! fondly I remember
  How proud my bosom swell'd,
When, dress'd in bloom of beauty,
  My only loved I first beheld.
Truth from her dark eye beaming--
  Love on each accent hung;
I seem'd of heaven dreaming,
  Whene'er she sweetly sung.

3.
Ah! fondly I remember
  Where our white cottage stood,
All dress'd in vines and roses,
  Close by the stream and shady wood.
Farewell to vale and mountain,
  Far from their joys I roam;
No more I'll see the fountain
  That bathes my childhood's home.
