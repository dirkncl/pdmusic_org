1.
'Tis my last parting song-- my boat's on the shore,
I may not behold thy bright eyes any more;
Sweet Elodie, list! while I pour forth my lay,
And remember its strain when thy bard's far away.
My heart will be thine, love, thro' weal and thro' woe,
My loadstar art thou, love, wherever I go.

2.
'Tis my last serenade-- but wherever I rove,
The theme of my song shall be Elodie-- love;
Sweet Elodie, pride of the green, sunny isle,
The light of my life is the beam of thy smile.
Farewell, then, to thee, love-- my barque's on the sea,
May good angels guard thee, my own Elodie.
