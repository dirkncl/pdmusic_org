1.
The Baron had a daughter fair
  But sixteen summers has she seen.
Her heart was light, no grief was there,
  And lov'd by all was she I ween;
But Love hath wiles for Beauty's smiles,
  As Alpine hunter young and bold,
Oft sought her bow'r at evening hour,
  And many a tale of rapture told.

[CHORUS]
"Fly to the mountain" whisper'd he --
Euli ha
Euli oh
Euli ho --
"Fly to the mountain love with me"
Eure la ha
Eure la ha
la la la --

2.
But she, the young betrothed, was claim'd
  By Olrieh's lord, the proud and old;
The day was fix'd, the dower named
  And counted out in shining gold.
The halls were bright that nuptial night,
  And gladness through the castle rung;
But there was one, who stood alone,
  And softly to the maiden sung --
"Fly to the mountain -- fly with me,
  Maidend of love! I wait for thee!"

(CHORUS)

A steed stood at the castle gate,
  And dark and lowering was the night;
Soon on his back the lovers sat;
  And swift and silent was their flight;
Now, joy betide the hunter's bride,
  Who gave a heart no gold could buy;
Long may she roam her mountain home,
  And sing the alpine melody.
"Life to the mountain wilds for me;
  Life in the valley, love with thee."

(CHORUS)
