Him, the Almighty power.
Him, the Almighty power,
Hurl’d headlong, flaming from the ethereal sky,
With hideous ruin
And combustion down
To bottemless perdition;
there to dwell
In adamantive chains,
In adamantive chains it penalize,
Who durst defy the omnipotent
to arms, to arms, to arms
Thy omnipotent to arms.
