1.
Jannet, Jannet, my meek-eyed pet, 
The birds are on the wing, 
The flow'rs spread out their perfumed leaves 
Upon the lap of Spring. 
And all around from vale to hill, 
Is deck'd in garments gay; 
For every breeze that comes and goes, 
Sings happy songs of May. 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Then seek the fields, my laughing pet, 
And gather flow'rs so gay; 
There's not a bird but sings­­ 
Jannet, come, come to the fields and play.

2.
Jannet, Jannet, on mountain top 
The golden sunbeams play; 
They drink up every drop of dew 
And drive the mist away. 
So ever may it be with you 
When sorrow's cloud appears, 
The sun of life and joy will shine 
And dry up all your tears.
