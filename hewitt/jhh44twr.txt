CHORUS [also sung after each verse]
Rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs,
See our gallant banners streaming,
Rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs;
See the eyes of beauty beaming,
Rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- rally, whigs--
Come from the east-- come from the west--
From north and south with glowing breast,
Rally, whigs-- rally, whigs-- ho!

1.
[SOLO]
See the fox's tail bristling,
  Frosted by the Tyler crew!
All the locos practise whistling,
  But their music will not do.

2.
Tyler shouts for annexation,
  What will Polk and Dallas do?
Oh! such clashing-- such vexation,
  How to mend the broken screw.

3.
What's food to us is loco _pizen_,
  But the fiat has gone forth;
Shout for CLAY and FRELINGHUYSEN,
   West and east and south and north.

4.
Let them gather all their forces,
  We are ready for the race;
Clumsy riders-- jaded horses,
  Make their prospects "quite a case!"

5.
While the Tariff flag is floating,
  Let these words our motto be--
"Each man _must_ do his own voting
  If he wants the County free!"
