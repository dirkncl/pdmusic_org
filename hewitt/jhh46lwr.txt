1.
Let Washington rest on Potomac's wild shore,
Where the winds murmur soft and proud eagles soar;
The noise of the world is unheeded by him,
His spirit rests sweetly where grey woods look dim.

CHORUS
His love lies beside him in quiet repose,
Let him rest undisturb'd 'neath the wild mountain rose.
The tears of his country he never can see,
Nor hear the glad song of the great and the free!

2.
Let Washington rest on the spot where he died,
Where the stars love to weep o'er the billowy tide;
In ages to come the pilgrim will weep
O'er the sod where the warrior lies calmly in sleep.

CHORUS
O peace to the hero who fought the good fight,
And maintain'd with his sword what his mind proclaim'd right.
Let him rest, let him rest while our standard shall wave,
O'er the birth place of freedom, and Washington's grave.
