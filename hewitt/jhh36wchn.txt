1.
Why, why, why comes he not?
Mildly over the waveless sea,
The pale moon sheds her gentle light,
Oh! why comes he not to me?
I told him to meet me here alone,
Under the willow tree,
Here he could breathe love’s vow again
Oh! why comes he not to me?

2.
Sad, sad, sad is my heart,
Should he leave me and faithless be;
I’ll sit alone and sigh for him,
Oh! why comes he not to me?
The night winds are sighing, he’s not here!
Sad moans the swelling sea;
Has he forgot his vow last night?
Oh! why comes he not to me?

3.
Yes, yes, yes, he will come,
Smiling fondly and cheerfully;
The stars seem whispering­­ he will come,
Oh! yes he will come to me!
Still, still not a sound disturbs the night,
Silence reigns o’er the sea;
Ah! could he count the tears I shed!
Oh! why comes he not for me?
