1.
You remember when we parted!
Far off stood the barge’s crew;
Doubting trembling, broken hearted,
I dar’d to breathe my soul’s adieu.
Gazing on the heaving billow,
With your snowy hand in mine;
And my bosom for your pillow
You gently whisper’d “I am thine!”

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
You remember when we parted!
Far off stood the barge’s crew;
Doubting trembling, broken hearted,
I dar’d to breathe my soul’s adieu.

2.
Years have pass’d­­ and still unchanging,
I have roam’d o’er land and sea;
Naught my trusting heart estranging,
From her who ruled its destiny.
But alas! the link is broken,
False the vow that I believed;
All is lost!­­ not one sad token
Is left for me­­ I was deceived!
