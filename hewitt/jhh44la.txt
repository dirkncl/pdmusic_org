1.
Lady, awaken— the moonlight is glowing
Beamy and bright from the deep azure sky.
Lady, awaken— the night breeze is blowing
Fitful and fresh from its chambers on high.

(Refrain) [repeat after each verse]
Lady, awaken— that moonlight may see
Its beauty and softness reflected from thee.

2.
Lady awaken— the night dew is steeping
Softly and sweetly the meadows afar;
Lady, awaken— the night wave is sleeping
Oh! wake thee, and list to thy lover’s guitar.

3.
Lady, awaken— the night bird is chaunting
Fondly and wildly his sweet serenade;
Lady, awaken— thy presence is wanting
To bless this enchantment before it shall fade.
