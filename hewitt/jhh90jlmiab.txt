1.
Jesus, lead me, I am blind. 
Lead me to the throne. 
I have left all sin behind. 
Trust on Thee alone. 
Ere the vital spark has fled, 
Ere the soul has flown. 
I would by Thy hand be led 
To my Master’s throne.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Jesus, lead me, I am blind. 
God I know is just and kind.

2.
Jesus, lead me­­ I am blind
To the unknown shore;
Where the pilgrim spirits find,
Blessings everywhere.
Then I’ll meet the loved ones gone
Near the throne of God;
With their spotless garments on
Freed from earthly sod.

3.
Jesus, lead me­­ I am blind,
Here I cannot stay;
Leaving earthly things behind,
While I grope my way.
Lord!­­ have mercy­­ take me home
To eternal day;
Here is naught but sin and gloom;
Take me, Lord­­ I pray.
