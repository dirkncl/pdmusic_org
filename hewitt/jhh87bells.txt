1. 
Hark! the merry chiming bells, 
  Ding, dong, ding, ding-ding, ding dong; 
On the air their cadence swells­
 ­ Ding, dong, ding, ding-dong! 
Solemn now they call to prayer. 
  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! 
When the wedding chime is there 
  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding.

2.
When the milkman’s bell you hear, 
  Ding, dong, ding, ding-ding, ding dong; 
Ere the streaks of day appear, 
 ­ Ding, dong, ding, ding-dong! 
Throw a book-jack at his head! 
  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! 
Then sneak softly back to bed,
  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding.

3. 
Where’s the tiny chestnut bell? 
  Ding, dong, ding, ding-ding, ding dong; 
What a stale old joke it tells! 
 ­ Ding, dong, ding, ding-dong! 
Peals of laughter will provoke, 
  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! 
At the speaker, not the joke.
  Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding 
  ding ding ding ding ding.
