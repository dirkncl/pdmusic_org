1.
[First Voice]
Cheerily thy bugle sounds,
When home returning o’re the lake;
Mer-ri-ly my bosom bounds,
As each clear swell bids echo wake.
[Second Voice]
Joyously I wing the note,
To tell thee that thy hunter’s near;
Merrily I speed my boat
Towards the home by thee made dear.

CHORUS [DUET sung after each verse]
Dearest! for thee, thee only,
These mountain wilds are sweet to me;
Each crag and valley lonely,
Is blest because ’tis lov’d by thee
Sound, sound, sound,
sound the merry, merry, mountain horn,
At evening’s close and morning’s rosy dawn.

2.
[First Voice]
Fearlessly thy footsteps roam,
Where snows hang on the dizzy steep;
Driving from its rocky home
The echo of the hollow deep.
[Second Voice]
Merrily the wildstag bounds
Until he feels the hunter’s spear;
Cheerily the glen resounds,
With chorus and the hunter’s cheer.
