1.
Lightly we skim o’er the sparkling sea,
Lady, fair lady to sing of thee;
Homely the strain may be,
Yet ’tis of love!
Whispering soft comes the evening gale
Bringing sweet odors from hill and vale;
Gently swells out our sail—
Gaily we move!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Lightly we skim o’er the sparkling sea,
Lady, fair lady to sing to thee;
Homely the strain may be,
Yet 'tis of love!
Yet 'tis of love!
Yet 'tis of love!
Yet 'tis of love!
Yet 'tis of love!

2.
List to the notes of our soft guitar,
Rough and untaught as our voices are,
Listen— bright morning star!
We sing to thee,
None, maid, but thou should our love song hear
'Tis made alone for thy gentle ear,
Sweetly its numbers clear
Float o’er the sea.
