1.
I will meet thee at evening twilight,
When balmy zephyrs kiss each flow'r;
I will meet thee when the gray night-bird
Sings its wild strain withing thy bow'r.
When the young stars, in all their beauty,
Look down upon the waveless sea;
And the pale moon, in queenly splendor,
Pours silver beams upon the lea.

[REFRAIN]
I will meet thee at at evening twilight,
When balmy zephyrs kiss each flow'r;
I will meet thee when the gray night-bird,
Sings its wild strain within thy bow'r.

2.
Where glade music fills halls of pleasure,
And Folly's noisy bells are heard;
Where the cold smile the love-pulse freezes,
And friendship is but a word:
I'll not meet thee in noisy places,
Or where the brow is dark with care;
Where the night winds are gently sighing,
I'll meet thee there, I'll meet thee there.

(REFRAIN)
