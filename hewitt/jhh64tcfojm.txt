1.
The snow is in the cloud,
  And night is gath'ring o'er us,
The winds are piping loud,
  And fan the blaze before us.
Then join the jovial band,
  And tune the vocal organ;
And with a will, we'll all join in,
  Three cheers for our Jack Morgan.

CHORUS
Gather round the campfire,
  Our duty has been done;
Let's gather round the campfire,
  And have a little fun;
Let's gather round the campfire,
  Our duty has been done,
'Twas done upon the battle field.
  Three cheers for Jack Morgan.

2.
Jack Morgan is his name,
  The fearless and the lucky;
No dastard foe can tame
  The son of old Kentucky.
His heart is with his State,
  He fights for Southern freedom;
His men their General's word await,
  They'll go where he will lead 'em.

3.
He swore to free his home,
  To burst her chains asunder,
With sound of trump and drum,
  And loud Confederate thunder;
And in the darksome night,
  By light of homestead burning,
He'll put the skulking foe to fight,
  Their hearts to wailings turning.

(CHORUS)

4.
The dungeon dark and cold
  Could not his body prison,
Nor tame a spirit bold
  That o'er reverse had risen;
Then sing the song of joy,
  Our toast be lovely woman,
And Morgan he's the gallant boy
  To plague the hated foeman!

(CHORUS)
