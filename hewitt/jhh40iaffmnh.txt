1.
I am far from my native home,
On the wide and surgy see,
While our gallant ship battles the foam,
The wind screams its wild melody --
There's a glimmering light on our wake,
'Tis the beacon light on the shore,
Like the last flash of Hope,
its rays break on the soul they will gladden no more,
Like the last flash of Hope,
its rays break on the soul they will gladden no more.

[CHORUS]
Fare thee, well
Land of the free.
The heart of the wand'rer, turns to thee.

2.
I may tarry in foreign lands,
But, my friends, my heart's with you;
I'll remember the press of your hands,
And the day that I bid you Adieu.
Oh! it matters not where my path turns,
My beacon star shall be the light,
the light of thy freedom that beams,
O'er the land of the brave and the free,
the light of thy freedom that beams,
O'er the land of the brave and the free.

(CHORUS)

3.
They may tell of their Kingly Courts,
Of their maidens bright and fair,
But the first is a freeman's thoughts
In his home and those he left there.
Then let the wild winds whistle on,
And the land loom on our lee;
Tho' the form of the wand'rer has gone
His heart his heart happy land is with thee.
Tho' the form of the wand'rer has gone
His heart his heart happy land is with thee.

(CHORUS)
