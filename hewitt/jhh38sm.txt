1. 
Sweet Mariette, the silent stars are beaming,
  The placid moon is smiling on the sea;
While sadly I on thy fair form am dreaming,
  Oh dost thou, dearest, give one thought to me?
  Oh dost thou, dearest, give one thought to me?

2. 
Dear Mariette, the glittering hall is lonely,
  When thou’t not there to smile away its gloom;
Each flow’ret seems to weep for thee, thee only,
  And hide its head, as if ’twere loth to bloom.
  And hide its head, as if ’twere loth to bloom.

3. 
Sweet Mariette, our youthful dreams are over,
  We may not meet as we have met before;
I may not kneel, as I have knelt a lover
  Thy ruby lips must smile on me no more.
  Thy ruby lips must smile on me no more.
