1. 
The moon was shining brightly,
Upon the battle plain;
The gentle breeze fann'd lightly
The features of the slain;
The guns had hush'd their thunder,
The drum in silence lay;
When came the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey,
The guns had hush'd their thunder,
The drum in silence lay;
When came the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey,

2. 
She cast a look of anguish,
On dying and on dead;
Her lap she made the pillow
Of those who groan'd and bled.
And when the dying soldier
For one bright gleam did pray,
He bless'd the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.
And when the dying soldier
For one bright gleam did pray,
He bless'd the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.

3. 
She gave the thirsty, water,
And dress'd the bleeding wound;
And gentle prayers she uttered,
For those who sigh'd around.
And when the bugle sounded,
Just at the break of day;
We bless's the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.
And when the bugle sounded,
Just at the break of day;
We bless's the Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.

4. 
For, tho' she lov'd her nation,
And pray'd that it might live;
Yet-- for the dying foemen
She had a tear to give.
Then, here's to that bright beauty,
Who drove death's pang away,
The meekeyed Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.
Then, here's to that bright beauty,
Who drove death's pang away,
The meekeyed Senoretta,
The maid of Monterey.
