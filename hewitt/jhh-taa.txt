1. 
Nightly I’m dreaming, dreaming of thee; 
Softly the vision steals over me. 
Thou art another’s, why should I kneel 
Low to an idol that can not feel? 
Breathe love­ I dare not­ wide the abyss 
That yawns before one! ’twixt me and bliss. 
Be my harp toneless­ be my voice mute, 
Silent forever the strings of my lute. 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Nightly I’m dreaming, dreaming if thee; 
Softly the vision steals over me. 
Thou art another’s, why should I kneel 
Low to an idol that cannot feel?

2. 
Be thou still happy, smiling and gay, 
Spreading around Thee joy’s  sunny ray; 
I, the lone wand’rer, far, far will rove, 
No longer seeking someone to love. 
And when sweet music sounds in the hall, 
While loving voices echo thy call, 
Think of the lost one, on foreign shore 
Nursing sad mem’ries­­ ever more ever more.
