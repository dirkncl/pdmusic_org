1.
Hail symbol of the Sunny South!
  Bright Banner of the free!
Our Southern hearts swell high with joy,
  When glory points to thee.
Thy Stars are like the _Pleiades_;
  Undim'd by Tyrant's power;
They'll deck thy Heav'n-dyed field of blue
  Till freedom's latest hour.

CHORUS
Flag of the Sunny South still wave,
  Where first from gloomy stars arose
Thy dazzling lustre ne'er shall pale
  Where freedom's martyr'd sons repose.

2.
Thou Emblem of our Liberty;
 Thy hallowed home is where
Dwell virtue, honor, beauty, too,
  Land of the Proud and Fair.
The breeze of ev'ry foreign land
  Beneath the sunlit skies,
Shall gently fan thy gorg'ous folds,
  Each sea reveal thy dyes.

(CHORUS)

3.
Over Secession's dying sons,
  Thou'st droop's thy blood-stained crest;
Witness'd the soldier's trembling prayer,
  Before he sunk to rest.
Thou'st flap'd away the weeping dews
  Where Washington now lies;
And mix'd with them thy gory tears
  Beneath his native skies.

(CHORUS)

4.
Though dark'ning clouds are hast'ning past,
  And desolation reigns;
Though lonely homes in mourning stand,
  And innocence complains;
Yet Heav'n will heed our fervant prayers--
  Bid peace o'er land and sea--
Bid angels dry our lov'd ones tears,
  And freedom's sun light thee.

(CHORUS)
