1.
Oh, when I shall see again,
  The proud Juniata,
Where bright billows kiss the shore,
  Where dwells Sally Carter?
The Cot where her father liv'd,
  Deep, deep in the valley,
The roses and jasmine
  That were guarded by Sally.

REFRAIN [repeat after each verse]
Sweet home of my heart!
Dear Cot in the valley!
The dwelling of peace,
The birthplace of Sally.

2.
I've wander'd the wide world o'er,
  But, bright Juniata!
My heart always turn'd to thee
  And dear Sally Carter.
I sought for forgetfulness
  'Mid fashion and riot;
To learn that true happiness
  Lov'd to smile in thy quiet.
