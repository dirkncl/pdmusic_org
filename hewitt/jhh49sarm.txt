Oh, sing this song-- when thee gather
A faithful, chosen few;
When thoughs are mingling with each other,
And hearts are warm and true.
Oh sing it when the pale stars glisten
Bright o'er the waveless sea;
When Zephyrs seem to stop and listen
Sing and remember me.
Sing and remember me.

When sorrow o'er thy heart is stealing,
And tears bedew thine eyes;
When twilight brings the hour of feeling
And stars tell distinies;
Then with thy light and fairy finger,
Wake sweetest melody;
Bid thoughts of other moments linger--
Sing, and remember me.
Bid thoughts of other moments linger
Sing and remember me.
