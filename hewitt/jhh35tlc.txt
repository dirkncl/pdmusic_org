1.
I’ll come to thee when the moon is full,
And floats in ether bright;
I’'ll come to thee when the sportive fay
Is rev’ling in delight.
I’ll come to thee, ere the morning sun,
Has quaff’d the maiden dew;
I’ll come to thee o’er the silv’ry tide,
And in my light canoe,
And in my light canoe.

2.
I’ll come to thee though the lightnings glare,
And startling thunders roar;
I’ll come to thee though the foaming tide
Should lash the pebly shore;
I’ll come to thee with a throbbing heart,
Unerring, faithful, true;
I’ll come to thee, and all danger scorn,
Come in my light canoe,
Come in my light canoe.

3.
I’ll come to thee at the sacred hour,
That hour we love so well;
I’ll come to thee ’neath the shady grove,
Where last I bade farewell.
I’ll come to thee with hope beating high,
And heart that guilt ne’er know;
I’ll come to claim thy promis’d vow,
Come in my light canoe,
Come in my light canoe!
