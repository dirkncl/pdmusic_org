"Darling Jane"
(circa 1825-1890)
Adapted to a Mesica Melody
by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

When the morn is in her fullness and the river sparkles bright,
When the mocking bird sings sweetly to this star of the night,
By the magnolia trees I oft meet my dear maiden,
The face star of the valley, the flower of the grove.
Pretty Jane, dearest Jane, she's the queen of my heart,
Lovely Jane fairy Jane! we will never more part,
For I love only thee and will ne'er cease to pine,
Till the stormy knot is tied that awakes
'Tis mine ever mine.
