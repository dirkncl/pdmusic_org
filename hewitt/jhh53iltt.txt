1.
I'll love thee when the spring flow'rs bloom--
  For 'twas in spring we met;
The blissful scenes which round us shone,
  Are fresh in mem'ry yet.
I know that we were younger then,
  But hearts as true as ours,
Have scarcely felt the chill of time,
  Or noted passing hours.
And, on our day of happiness,
  Joy's sun has scarecely set,
Then, in the springtime I will love,
  For it was then we met.

2.
I'll love thee in the summer too,
  For, when the spring is past,
Thy summer smiles so beauteously
  Around my path were cast.
And tho' the hand of time has press'd
  Relentless on my brow--
And age is slowly creeping on,
  Still-- still I'll love thee now.
For, see-- our spring of love is o'er,
  Ripe fruits our branches fill--
Yet, be it spring or summer time,
  Thine shall my love be still!
