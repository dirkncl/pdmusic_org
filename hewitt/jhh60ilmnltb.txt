1.
America, my native land,
Star of the glorious west!
To thee I sing my boyhood's song;
I love my native land the best.
Tho' I have roam'd to distant climes,
Like a dove in search of rest,
To thee I turn and sing once more
I love my native land the best.

CHORUS
I love, I love my native land,
I love, I love my native land;
To thee I turn and sing once more,
I love my native land the best.

2.
Here freedom pure forever dwells,
The eagle is her crest;
Here grows the tree of liberty,
I love my native land the best.
And men renowned for nable deeds,
Who fought and stood the test,
Brave heroes of America;
I love my native land the best.

CHORUS
I love, I love my native land,
I love, I love my native land;
Brave heroes of America!
I love my native land the best.

3.
The holy Bible here is free
Our guide to make us blest;
Home of my birth! I cling to thee,
I love my native land the best.
Co-lum-bia, saw [sud-?] ev-er-more!
All ly-[rible?] we detest;
The glory of my song shall be;
I love my native land the best.

CHORUS
I love, I love my native land,
I love, I love my native land;
The glory of my song shall be;
I love my native land the best.
