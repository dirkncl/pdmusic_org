1.
You've told me many a time and oft,
  That I was fair and comely,
My eyes were bright -- my tresses soft,
  And other girls were homely.
"She's quite too young to know her will."
  The folks say to each other;
But if you truly love me still,
  Why __ go and ask my mother.

REFRAIN
Go, go, go, go.
  Go and ask my mother.

2.
I've seen you dance with city girls,
  And flirt with country cousins;
Praise Julia and her raven curls,
  And glances threw by dozens.
I thought it very strange, and vow'd
  I'd look out for another;
But, when you smiled, my anger bow'd,
  So __ go and ask my mother.

(REFRAIN)

3.
I'm told there's care in in married life,
  That all the joy's in courting;
When young men have secured a wife,
  They say their vows were sporting.
I won't believe what old maids say.
  If you won't choose another;
You've bother'd me so much today,
  Do __ and ask your mother.

(REFRAIN)
