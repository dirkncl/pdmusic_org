1.
The times have changed since Christopher
  Columbus touch'd this rocky shore;
What then was quite a wilderness,
  Is now the exiles lucky shore.
Our fathers noble battles fought,
  Without the hope of pensioning;
Now military pride is dress;
  Alas! it won't bear mentioning

REFRAIN
It wont it wont it wont bear mentioning.

2.
Our mother's used to spin and reel
  Now men do all the _reeling_, sirs;
And, for an honest, open trade,
  We now have _double_ dealing, sirs.
The girls they used to darn and knit,
  And look, and feel quite sin-shunning;
But now -- it is a sin to work
  Alas, it won't bear mentioning.

(REFRAIN)

3.
Instead of mails three an hour,
  Steam now gives such velocity,
That boys to manhood grow by steam,
  That wonderful precocity!
Our fathers lived in perfect health,
  All patent compounds then shunning;
We've now our _Ralph_ and _Brandneim's_ pills,
  Alas! it won't bear mentioning.

(REFRAIN)

4.
The music of the spinning wheel
  Was once the reigning fashing sirs
But now we have the Pi_an_o
  And tender "songs of passion" sirs.
Young men would meet a smart rebuff,
  Their chosen maidens when shunning;
But, now they sue for _damages_
  Alas! it won't bear mentioning.

(REFRAIN)

5.
The safest banks were _banks_ of earth,
  They'd honest profit warrent ye;
But now we've banks of Cob-webs built,
  And rotten paper currency.
The banks are now all shaving shops,
  For silver ten-per-cent shunning;
The rich are fattening on the poor,
  Alas it won't bear mentioning.

(REFRAIN)
