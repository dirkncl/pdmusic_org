1.
Where the mountain ash nods to the tempest's wild howling,
Where the echo shrinks mute in the vale dark and deep;
Where the gaunt vulture soars and the grim wolf's prowling,
The bones of dead heroes are taking their sleep.
No slab there appears, wet with sorrowing tears;
The hemlock and laurel hang over the spot;
And nobody knows where the reliques repose,
Of the soldier whose deeds and whose name are forgot.

[REFRAIN]
Let the requiem be sung; let the sad pray'r be said,
For the heroes forgotten -- the Unknown Dead.
For the heroes forgotten -- the Unknown Dead.

They have fought for their rights, for the land of their sires,
Their forms have stood up like a bulwark of might;
They have knelt at the altar where burn Freedom's fires,
And thrust back the foe in her glorious light.
No bright stars for them, pluck'd from Fame's diadem;
Unnoticed, unheeded, they acted their parts,
'Mid the clashing of arms, and the battle's alarms,
They fell with the love of home deep in their hearts.

3.
Then let him sleep on 'neath the sod of the valley,
Where night dews will have the long grass o'er their beds;
Above, on the great day of muster they'll rally,
And glory will twine a bright wreath round their heads.
No white marble stone shall rise o'er the Unknown;
But in our sad hearts a fresh record shall be;
Tho' nam'd never more, they will live in the core,
The bravest who fought and who died for the free.

(REFRAIN)
