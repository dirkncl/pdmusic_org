1. 
Let me sleep my last sleep in the land of my birth,
Near the spot where my Father lies under the earth;
Where the marble slabs tell of the friends that repose
'Neath the green grass that sighs when the wind gently blows.
The old chuch still looks on that beautiful spot,
And the sound of its bell can ne'er be forgot;
The parson was old-- and a good mas was he,
But where is he now? seek the tombstone and see.

2. 
Let me sleep near the cot where I first saw the light,
Where my boyhood was happy, my noon of life bright;
Let me sleep by my Mother, who said e'er she died,
That her dearest and only should ne'er leave her side.
Be near me the few of my friends who still live,
How sweet and how soothing the farewell they'd give!
It would soften the death-- pang were they by my side;
Let me draw my last breath where my dear Mother died.
