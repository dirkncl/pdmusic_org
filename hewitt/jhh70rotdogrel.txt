1. 
Rest, O rest in silent slumber
’Til the judgement trumpet peals;
Hearts are bleeding without number,
Ev’ry one deep sorrow feels, deep sorrow feels;
Ev’ry one deep sorrow feels,
deep sorrow feels, deep sorrow feels,
deep sorrow feels, deep sorrow feels.

2. 
Never more thy sword shall glisten,
On the battle’s crimson plain.
Ghostly host now crowd to listen
To thy loud command again, command again,
To thy loud command again, command again,
command again, command again,
command again.
