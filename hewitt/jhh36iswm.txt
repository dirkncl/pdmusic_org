1.
In smiles we met, in tears we parted,
Joy’s sunshine linger’d but a while,
Its cheering ray a moment darted,
Then came a tear for ev’ry smile.
But we will drink of grief together,
The cup hath lost its bitterness;
For tho’ the rose in frost may wither,
Its perfum’d off’ring is not less.

2.
The wings of time are onward sweeping,
They scatter snowdrops as they go;
Why, why should we seek chill age weeping,
While yet our hearts can feel a glow.
Oh! let us love, tho’ parted ever,
Warm hearts like ours should beat as one;
Rude hands the wind-harp’s strings may sever,
Yet, who can steal the sad harp’s tone?
