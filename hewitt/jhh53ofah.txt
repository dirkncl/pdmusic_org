1.
[1st Voice]
When wand'ring far away in cold and distant climes,
We hear the merry bells peal out their Christmas chimes;
How fondly turns the heart from the Country where we roam,
To find a blissful rest by our fireside at home.
[2nd Voice]
Their smiling lips and beaming eyes,
  Are gather'd round the sparkling hearth;
Tho' humble, tis a paradise,
  The dearest spot on earth.

DUETT [repeat after each verse]
Then, blessings on our happy home,
Our happy home and fireside;
We'll sigh for them where'er we roam
O'er land or ocean's tide.

2.
[1st Voice]
When care and sorrow press the heart they cannot break,
When scorn seems in each look and sunshine friends forsake;
Then, dove-like flies the heart o'er ocean's crest of foam
To nestle with the tried by our fireside at home.
[2nd Voice]
There sweet content is ever seen,
  And friendship wipes our tears away;
Joy's magic wreath is always green,
  And life's a sunny day.
