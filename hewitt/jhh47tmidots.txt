1.
The moon is dancing on the sea,
  The stars smile in her train;
They seem to sing in harmony
  An echo to our strain.
And gently o'er the meadows green,
  The midnight zephyrs sigh
A song of homage to our queen,
  While they are passing by.

REFRAIN
Oh, lovely maid, there's joy in ev'ry star,
Look out tonight, oh, shame its light
And hear our soft guitar.

CHORUS
Oh, lovely, maid, there's joy in ev'ry star,
Look out tonight, oh, shame its light
And hear our soft guitar.

2.
The waves that gently kiss the shore,
  And drink the silvery light,
Their joyous notes of homage pour
  And praise your charms so bright.
The night bird, too, has ceased her strain,
  To catch our native lay,
Then hear it o'er the shadowy plain,
  And give it to the day.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)

3.
Then, maiden fair, arise -- arise,
  True hearts your praises sing;
Love warmly glows 'neath starry skies,
  With balmy airs of spring.
Then, cheer us with one radiant gaze,
  One word responsive speak,
And we will praise your eyes bright rays.
  And blushes on your cheek.

(REFRAIN)
(CHORUS)
