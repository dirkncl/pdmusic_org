1. 
The sun was slowly setting 
Behind the woody hills; 
And murm'ring sounds were gushing 
From many joyous rills; 
When thro' the shadow'd valley 
An aged soldier came; 
His stern and hardy features 
Bore many a mark of fame.

2. 
He gaz'd upon the Village 
Where first the light he saw; 
Where was his father's cottage, 
By elm trees shaded o'er? 
The church was there-- the graveyard, 
And there the old oak tree; 
"Ah! happy days of childhood! 
But none remember me!"

3. 
He found his home in ruins, 
The graveyard told the rest; 
There slept his aged parents, 
Beneath earth's grassy breast. 
Although he'd breasted danger 
And bled on land and sea; 
He sigh'd, "I now surrender, 
For none remember me!"
