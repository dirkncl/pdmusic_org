While thus in glee together,
We sing our social lay
In spite of wind and weather
We pass our time away
Ha, ha, ha laugh while yet ye may,
A good laugh drives away dull care,
Ha, ha, ha- join our merry lay,
And make old moping sorrow stare.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
We'll join the merry lay.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
We'll join the merry lay.
We'll join the merry lay.
We'll join the merry lay.
