RECITAVIVO
My beauteous child! sweet mountain flow'r!
Bright sunbeam in a darksome hour,
Why first come forth to greet thy sire,
With tuneful song and youthful choir?
Know ye, I've made a holy vow
To God, if vict'ry crown'd my brow;
To slay the first that on my smiled
When home was reach'd -- 'tis thou, my child!

ARIA
Despair, despair has seiz'd my heart;
I cannot kiss thy dimpled cheek;
I cannot smoothe thy locks apart,
With out a pang too sharp to speak.
All, all, all thou art my life to me;
And I must live to weep alone.
Sleeping to dream, to dream my child of thee --
Waking to think, to think of thee, and moan.
Smile not, child -- it mocks my grief,
Bow to thy God, thine hours are brief.
