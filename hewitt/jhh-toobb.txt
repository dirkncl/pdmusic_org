1. 
Oh, don’t you know Herr Schneider?
Dat vas a happy man!
Unt he lived in de Rhine counteree
Unt his garten vos so fat,
Unt his frau she vos so shien,
Unt his bock he vos so handsome as never you did see.
His baskets dey were full up mit golt wit silver too,
Unt his krout it vos white unt so strong.
Unt his limberger cheese vos so lively unt nice,
Dot de maggots did walk it along.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, don’t you know Herr Schneider?
Dot vos a happy man?
Unt his frau she was so happy just as he.
His bock was strong unt fat, till he fell into de vat,
Unt vos drunk as a Billy-goat could be-be-be,
Unt vos drunk as a Billy-goat could be.

2.
His beer vos brewed in summer,
Dot summer past unt gone,
Unt of speckle had, much salted down.
But before all dem tings, vos one ting close to Schneider’s head,
Vos dos bock all speckled over, mit little spots of brown.
All speckled o’er mit brown dots, upon his hair so red,
Unt his voice vos so sweet in its tone.
Unt he swallow’d pumpernickle just so same as oder men,
Unt his head was so hard like a stone.
