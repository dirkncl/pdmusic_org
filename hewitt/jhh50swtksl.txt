1. 
She wept to know she lov’d, 
For he was lowly born, 
While she in wealth and splendour mov'd 
With Pride's tiara on. 
At morning dawn, at twilight dim, 
Her fervent prayers were breath'd for him, 
The lowly youth who nobly strove 
To win his lady's love. 

[Refrain] [sung after each verse]
She wept to know she lov'd, 
For he was lowly born. 
While She in wealth and splendour mov'd 
With Pride's tiara on.

2. 
The lord knelt at her feet, 
The baron sue'd in vain; 
To her no song was half so sweet 
As one remember'd strain; 
It was the song the peasant sung 
When twilight on the mountain hung; 
The wild, yet tender serenade 
Of youth to listening maid.

3. 
She wept to know she lov'd, 
And heavy years pass'd on; 
No prayer her withering sorrow moved, 
No smile a glad look won. 
The pride of birth-- the passion wild, 
The mute despair when oth ers smiled, 
Soon swept the drooping flow'r away, 
That smiled in its decay.
