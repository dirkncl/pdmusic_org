Clemie here­­ Clemie there,
Clemie wanted ev’rywhere.
In the kitchen, on the stair­­
Clemie’s floating in the air.
Of new shoes she has a pair
With her Sunday dress to wear,
How she limps, as if she were
An aged duck all filled with care
For twenty ducklings, almost bare.
Clemie, you’re a fixin’ rare,
Half a lamb and half a bear!
Of life’s pains you have your share,
Still you can laugh­ sometime, when prayer
Is uttered, Voila’ tout, ma chere.
Viola’ tout ma chere­­ Viola’ tout ma chere!

Clemie’s smart­­ Clemie’s bright,
Clemie loves to read and write;
In the morning, in the night,
Reading books is her delight.
With her taper fingers white,
Turning leave to left and right;
Oh, it is a charming sight
To behold her in a fright,
When she reads of ghost and sprite,
Then a touching tale will quite
Her sensibilities excite,
’Till a tear gleams in the light
Still the girl displays some spite,
And sometimes shows that she can fight.
Viola’ tout ma chere­­ Viola’ tout ma chere!
