1.
Say, Jennie, do you love me? 
Oh, tell one once again; 
Twill fall like angel music, 
A soft, delicious strain! 
Oh, tell me in a whisper, 
Or tell me in a song; 
You cannot say too often 
The words I've known so long. 

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Say, Jennie, that you love me, 
Say that your love is true; 
And, when the leaves are falling, 
That I may marry you.

2.
Close by the Hudson ri-ver, 
Where fields and woods are green, 
And birds are singing love-songs, 
A cottage may be seen. 
'Twas built for you, my darling, 
Amid the vines and flowers; 
There life will pass so blissful, 
A chain of sunny hours. 

3.
The dazzle of the city, 
May charm a little while; 
But heartless and deceitful 
Is Fashion's courtly smile. 
Then­­ Jennie, say you love me, 
And­­ as my charming bride, 
Will share my quiet cottage 
Down by the river side.
