1.
Farewell, farewell since we must part,
  But oft a tear I’ll shed for thee;
Thy name shall cling around my heart,
  To light the waste of memory,
  To light the waste of memory.

2.
Oh! when amidst the gay you rove,
  When pleading eyes around you shine;
Think of the one who dared to love,
  Whose every pulse was thine,
  Whose every pulse was thine.

3.
Adieu! Adieu! perhaps that tear,
  Which, trembling, plays upon thy cheek,
Proclaims my name to thee still dear,
  And speaks more truth than tongue could speak,
  And speaks more truth than tongue could speak.

4.
Oh! then if I am still thine own,
  Why should my heart anguish swell?
Alas! from thee fore’er I turn,
  We meet no more, farewell, farewell,
  We meet no more, farewell, farewell!
