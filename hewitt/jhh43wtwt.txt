1.
When thou wer't true, when thou wer't true,
My heart did thy impression take,
As do the depths, where skies are blue,
Of come wood-girt and quiet take
The image of the moon, that gives
The calmness in whose light she lives.
  The image of the moon, that gives
  The calmness in whose light she lives.

2.
But when doubts came, my troubled brest,
Was like that lake when rude winds blow;
Her image there though still impress'd,
Beams brokenly in ebb and flow,
Until the storm obsures her light,
And reigns the ebon visag'd might.
  Until the storm obsures her light,
  And reigns the ebon visag'd might.

3.
Again that changing moon shall shine,
When storms are o'er within the lake,
Which, like that wayward heart of thime,
Can any other image take;
Mine, graven like memorial stone,
Is now a memory alone;
  Mine, graven like memorial stone,
  Is now a memory alone.
