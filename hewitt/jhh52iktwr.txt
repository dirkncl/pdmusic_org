To Miss Rose Morris.
"I Knew Thou Would'st Return"* (1852)
[*On hearing that a lady whose love had
embarked in the Steamer Atlantic never
despaired of his return.]
Words by Frederick William Thomas, 1806-1866
Music by John Hill Hewitt, 1801-1890

1.
I knew thou would'st return, mine own wave toss'd;
  I know thou would'st return, again to me;
When others said that ev'ry soul was lost,
  I claim'd thee of the dark and dang'rous sea.
    I knew thou would'st return,
    I knew thou would'st return.

2.
I whisper'd to the winds, thou wert my love,
  And they were silent in their ocean waves;
I told it to the stars and bid them prove
  Our constancy and light thy path of waves.
    I knew thou would'st return,
    I knew thou would'st return.

3.
And when my friends all feign'd a trusting heart,
  I told them oft that mine was on the sea;
I knew not why, I could not take a part
  With their hush'd fears, but knelt and pray'd for thee.
    I knew thou would'st return,
    I knew thou would'st return.

4.
I knew thou would'st return, because my claim
  Was stronger than the storm, or winds or sea;
It was my trust in His all hallow'd name
  Who answers faith, who gave thee back to me.
    I knew thou would'st return,
    I knew thou would'st return.
