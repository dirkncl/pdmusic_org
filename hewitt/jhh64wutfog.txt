1.
When upon the field of glory,
  'Mid the battle cry,
And the smoke of cannon curling
  Round the mountain high;
Then sweet mem'ries will come o'er me,
  Painting home and thee ...
Nerving me to deeds of daring,
  Struggling to be free.

CHORUS
Weep no longer, dearest,
  Tears are now in vain.
When this cruel war is over,
  We may meet again.

2.
Oft I think of joys departed,
  Oft I think of thee;
When night's sisters throw around me
  Their star'd canopy.
Dreams so dear come o'er my pillow,
  Bringing up the past.
Oh! how sweet the soldier's visions!
  Oh! how short they last!

(CHORUS)

3.
When I stand, a lonely picket,
  Gazing on the moon,
As she walks her starry pathway
  In night's silent noon;
I will think that thou art looking
  On her placid face;
Then our thoughts will meet together
  In a heavenly place.

(CHORUS)

4.
When the bullet, swiftly flying
  Through the murky air,
Hits its mark--my, sorrow'd bosom--
  Leaving death's pang there;
Then my thoughts on thee will turn, love,
  When I prostate lie,
My pale lips shall breathe "God bless thee!--
  For our cause I die!"

CHORUS
Weep then for me, dearest,
  When I'm free from pain;
When this crue war is over,
  In Heaven we'll meet again.
