1.
As an old jackdaw and a young jackdaw,
  Were walking out together;
As birds will do, you very well knew,
  That are of the very same feather.
Says the young jackdaw to the old jackdaw,
  "I won't walk another stride,
For I see a cow in yonder meadow,
  So let us get up and ride."

2.
As the old jackdaw and the young jackdaw
  Were riding a top of the cow;
Says the young jackdaw to the old jackdaw,
  "I can ride as well as thou!"
Says the old jackdaw to the young jackdaw,
  "You can't ride half so good;"
Says the young jackday to the old jackdaw,
  "If I can't, confound my blood!"

3.
As the old jackday and the young jackdaw
  Were carrying on their dispute;
Says the old jackdaw to the young jackdaw,
  "I guess you had better be mute."
Says the young jackday to the old jackdaw,
  "You're trying to kick up a row!"
Says the old jackdaw to the young jackdaw,
  "I'll tumble you off the cow!"

4.
Says the young jackday to the old jackdaw,
  "Such vanity I do despise;"
Says the old jackdaw to the young jackdaw,
  "I'll peck out both of your eyes."
Says the young jackday to the old jackdaw,
  "Fie on you! you wicked old witch!"
So, the old jackdaw seized the young jackdaw,
  And tumbled him into the ditch!

5. Moral.
Now, all good folks a moral learn;
  Don't show too much of your pride;
And whenever you go a walking out
  Don't never get up and ride,
Like the young jackdaw you may repent,
  And come off with a bloody nose;
Or crawl from out of a dirty ditch,
  With the mud all over your clothes.
