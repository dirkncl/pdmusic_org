[Master, in broken English]
Come pretty miss, your lesson rehearse,
And mind that each note you read.
[Pupil]
My cold is so bad, I'm sure it gets worse,
I'll murder the music indeed, indeed,
I'll murder the music indeed!
[Master]
Your cold, oh dear! go on, go no;
You much affectation, I'm sure;
[Pupil]
Well then if you will I'll try to obey
An angel, you know can't do more.

Fa sol la fa sol la si sol
la si do la si do re si
do re me do re mi fa re
mi fa sol mi, fa! la!

[Master]
Vat you mean by such bad sound,
Just same like the noisey hound;
Try the ca va ti [- -],
And make no discord any how.

[Master]
One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four,
good! good!
mind the stress, miss
One, two, three, four,
Swell boldly
smoothly, smoothly
now;
Softly, gently,
mind the slurs and let your voice out,
one, two, three, four,
short!
One, two, three, four,
good!
presence presence take charge miss
good good
Boldly [- -]
mind the slur'd notes
Glide down smoothly
one, two, three, four,
swell, soft now
one, two, three, four;
mind charming
beautiful!

[Repeat DUET]

[Master]
Ah! turn away those wicked eyes,
The shine like stars up in the skies;
And when those pretty lips I see,
I think they ever, ever speak to me.

[Pupil]
Oh sir, you flatter
[Master]
Do I -- no matter,
[Pupil]
Can I believe you
[Master]
Would I deceive you?
[Master and Pupil]
No, no, no,

We'll live and love together
No sorrow shall be ours;
We'll bid young joy come hither,
And strew our path with flowers,
We'll live and love together
No sorrows shall be ours
We'll bid young joy come hither
And strew our path with flowers,
And strew our path with flowers,
our path with flowers,
with flowers, with flowers,
with flowers, with flowers.
