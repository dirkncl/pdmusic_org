1. 
In a lone quiet spot by the side of a hill, 
Where the sycamore grows, and the wild willow's weeping 
There's a requiem steals from a sweet little rill, 
And chants o’er the mound where my Julia is sleeping. 

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Then mourn for my Julia, my joys are all over, 
I never shall see my dear treasure again; 
She's gone, and I've lost her I ne’er shall recover, 
Oh! soon let me die to relieve me from pain.

2. 
The nightingale lingers and ceases to sing, 
As he slowly unfolds his dark wing o'er my treasure; 
The raven's loud croak makes the midnight air ring, 
As he pours forth his dirge in a sorrowful measure.

3. 
A heaven it was when I sat by her side, 
For she, like an angel, would cheer me to gladness; 
But, oh! when I hoped to have made her my bride, 
She died, and I'm left to but sorrow and sadness.
