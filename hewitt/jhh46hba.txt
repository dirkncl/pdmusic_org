1.
[DUET]
How beautiful appears,
The morning's saffron sky,
When sparkle dewy tears,
And light clouds hang on high;
Bright pictur'd on the deep,
The hues of Heaven rest;
There all its beauties sleep
Upon the sea's calm breast,
Upon the sea's calm breast.

[1st Soprano]
The clouds that float aloft,
With blushes on each fold,
As if a finger soft
Had edg'd them round with gold.

[2nd Soprano]
And then the deep blue sky,
That peers in depths between
The woods of varied dye,
The fields of pleasant green.

2.
[DUET]
There's music in the breeze,
That slowly creeps along,
The brake and loftly trees,
Are eloquent with song;
All nature seems at rest,
No voice breathes o'er the flood,
And all the earth seems blest
With thy pure spirit, God!
With thy pure spirit, God!
