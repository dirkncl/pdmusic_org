1.
[SOLO]
O, whar's dat ole grey nigger gone,
  Who used to work de hoe
In massa's fields, and hill de corn,
  A long time ago?

CHORUS
You ax us whar dat nigger's went,
  Dat fine old nigger Joe?
He's gone to see de Elephant,
  Down below, down below.
||: Poor ole Joe! he used to work de hoe,
And play de ole banjo,
A long time ago. :||

2.
[SOLO]
He had no teef-- and he was blind,
  His wool was white as snow;
But massa to ole Joe was kind
  A long time ago.

CHORUS
He used to fish for crabs and eels,
  Dat fine old nigger Joe;
Till grim Death sent him neck & heels
  Down below-- down below.
||: Poor ole Joe! he used to work de hoe,
And play de ole banjo,
A long time ago. :||

3.
[SOLO]
He used to chalk de winters down,
  And kept his age just so;
It was a hundred and forty one,
  A long time ago.

CHORUS
But Death has cotch ole Joe at last,
  Tho' he was lofe to go,
He's in de cornfield sleeping fast,
  Down below-- down below.
||: Poor ole Joe! he used to work de hoe,
And play de ole banjo,
A long time ago. :||
