Thus the bright and beautiful
Pass away at early dawn, 
Ere the kindly dews of heav’n, 
Drink the radiance of the sun; 
Yes, Thus the bright and beautiful, 
Pass away at early dawn, 
Ere the kindly dews of heav’n, 
Drink the radiance of the sun. 
Fairest flow’r by Judah lov’d, 
Thine has been an early doom; 
But there’s endless bliss above, 
A joy   beyond the tomb, 
Lo the martial tramp of troops is heard, 
And gath’ring crowds advance; 
Now, mark the flash of spear and sword, 
While banners in the light ning glance. 
Falter not, sweet maiden, 
Falter not, falternot, 
Tho’ with sorrow laden, 
Meet, meet thy lot, 
Falter not, falter not, 
Falter not, falter not, falter not; 
But meet thy lot, 
But meet thy lot, 
But meet thy lot, 
But meet thy lot, 
But meet thy lot, 
But meet thy lot, 
Yes, Thus the bright and beautiful, 
Pass away at early dawn, 
E’re  the kindly dews of heav’n, 
Drink the radience of the sun. 
Drink the radiance, radience of the sun. 
Drink the radience of the sun. 
The sun, the sun, the sun.
