1.
While the evening star was shining
  Brightly on the sparkling sea,
Sat a lovely maid reclining,
  Who so sad; so lone as she;
By her only love forsaken,
  Dimly did Hope's pale lamp burn;
And her heart she felt was breaking,
  Tho' she thought he would return.

2.
Long she gazed, her tears restraining,
  O'er the star-illumined deep;
When she heard the waves complaining,
  Sadly did that maiden weep.
Star by star went out from heaven,
  Morning's light began to burn;--
Yonder barque, by light winds driven,
  Might be his-- he may return.

3.
Noon's bright sun illumed the ocean,
  Still the barque came dancing on;
Slowly first, now swift its motion,
  Like a snow drift in the sun.
Hope again lit up her bosom,
  When will Hope's lamp cease to burn?
Lo! her lover-- did she lose him?
  Joy proclaimed his safe return.
