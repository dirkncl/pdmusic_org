1.
[She]
Oh! Mister Snibbs, you cruel man!
  Where have you been all day?
You know that I'm quite indisposed,
  Where have you been I pray?
[He]
My dearest love, now don't be cross.
  At Miss Smith's I tarried;
You know she's such a friend of ours,
  And three times has been married.

[DUET, with overlapping voices]
[She]
I've told you often Mister Snibbs,
  That Mrs. Smith I hate;
She loves to chat with married men,
  And makes her hours late.
[He]
Now Mrs. Snibbs, dear Mrs. Snibbs,
  You're angry, Mrs. Snibbs,
Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs,
  Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs.

2.
[She]
Tis your unkindness, Mr. Snibbs,
  That makes me pine away;
All night you're playing whist or loo,
  With Mrs. Smith all day.
[He]
My love -- you know your jealousy,
  Is known all o'er the City;
I cannot bow to widow Smith,
  But what you get quite gritty!

[DUET, with overlapping voices]
[She]
My jealousy! -- well I declare!
  Of such a thing as you!
Why, Mr. Snibbs -- you're scarcely worth,
  One thought -- and much less two.
[He]
Now Mrs. Snibbs, dear Mrs. Snibbs,
   You're angry, Mrs. Snibbs,
Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs,
  Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs.

3.
[She}
When I was single, Mr. Snibbs,
  You'd scorn to treat me so,
You sigh'd so humbly at my feet
  And wept when I said "no".
[He]
But when I took my hat to go,
  You'd call me back, I guess,
You didn't think it very wrong,
  Just then to answer "yes".

[DUET, with overlapping voices]
[She]
You're guite a brute, I do declare,
  You've torn my heart to bits.
You cruel -- ugly -- hateful thing --
  I'm going into fits!
[He]
Now, Mrs. Snibbs, dear Mrs. Snibbs,
  You're foolish, Mrs. Snibbs,
Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs,
  Mrs. Snibbs, Mrs. Snibbs.
