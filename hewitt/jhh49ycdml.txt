1. 
You cannot doubt my love for you, 
Nor can you once upbraid me; 
When in the grave my form you view, 
Where your unkindness laid me. 
Have I not smil’d when you were glad, 
And joy’d while pleasure lasted! 
Have I not wept when you were sad, 
And lov’d the grief you tasted! 
You cannot doubt my love for you, 
Nor can you once up  braid me; 
When in the grave my form you view, 
Where your unkindness laid me.

2. 
Then doubt me not, if burning tears, 
And shades I woo about me, 
Test not the love I own for you, 
Then for a moment doubt me. 
So wildly has my bosom beat, 
That, though its pulse was lonely, 
The very grief it nurs’d was sweet, 
It sprung from you, you only. 
Then doubt me not, if burning tears, 
And shades I woo about me, 
Test not the love I own for you, 
Then for a moment doubt me.
