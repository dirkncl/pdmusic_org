1. 
Sing a song of the days that have fled,
Shed a tear o’er the grave of the past;
Give a sigh for the friends that are dead,
Who were loving and true to the last.
Through life’s dreary pathway a rover,
By sorrows and crosses oppressed.
There’s no rest for the heart broken lover
No spot where his feet may find rest.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Oh, mem’ries that cling to the heart,
Oh pangs that will ne’er pass away,
Thou dear one, though perished thou art,
That rest may be with thee, I pray.

2. 
Long ago I was happy and gay,
For I loved and was loved in return;
She was fair as the lily of May,
And as pure as the dew of the morn.
The spoiler’s form shadowed her bower.
And many a soft tale he told.
His smile cast a blight on the flower,
It withered and died in the cold.
