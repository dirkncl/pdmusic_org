1.
They've dress'd her for the bridal,
  And wreath'd her snowy brow;
They little heed the sorrow
  That clouds her features now.
And there are smiles around her,
  And glad sounds fill the air,
The nuptial hall is lighted,
  But, O, her heart's not there,

[REFRAIN]
The nuptial hall is lighted,
  But, O, her hear's not there.

2.
He leads her to the altar,
  And breathes into her ear
The tender vow oft spoken
  And answer'd by a tear;
She thinks of one departed,
  And breathes a silent prayer;
And, tho' the pledge she utters--
  Still, still her heart's not there.

[REFRAIN]
And, tho' the pledge she utters--
  Still, still her heart's not there.

3.
She's left the home of childhood,
  And mingles with the gay,
But scenes of joy and pleasure
  Dare not her grief away;
Death lays his icy fingers
  Upon her brow of care,
The grave receives the mourner--
  A broken heart lies there!

[REFRAIN]
The grave receives the mourner--
  A broken heart lies there!
