1.
Have you ever seen the high blue mountain,
  In old Virginia state?
There 'mid dark rocks and chrystal fountains,
  Dwells my lovely Kate.
She's the darling of all those that know her,
  And proud will beat my heart
When the good old folks on me bestow her
  Never more to part.

CHORUS [repeat after each verse]
Oh, how sadly now my heart is beating
For my lovely mountain maid;
When will come the blissful day of meeting,
When will grief with joy be paid.

2.
Oh! how fondly does this heart remember
  The days now past and gone,
The joys of May and cold December,
  Happy night and morn.
I would gather the wild mountain flowers,
  And wreathe her snowy brow;
But they have vanish'd those love wing'd hours.
  Loneliness reigns now.
