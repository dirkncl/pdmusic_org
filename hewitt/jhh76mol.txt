1.
How oft in the distance, a lone star I see,
So pensively gazing upon the red morn;
Its fast-fading splendor then brings back to me,
Sad mem'ries of days that are faded and gone.

[REFRAIN]
Sad mem'ries of love! Sweet mem'ries of love,
That fall on the heart like the dews from above.

2.
Tho' it caries mu fancies beyond the dark stream,
Still its beauty my heart's live-long anguish reveals;
For gone is the charm of my childhood's bright dream,
And the heart beats too proudly to tell what it feels.

(REFRAIN)

3.
The beautiful star with its future so bright,
That lured such a tranquil repose from above,
Was shadow'd behind the dark mists of the night,
And with it the beautiful mem'ries of love.

(REFRAIN)
