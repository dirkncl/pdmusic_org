1.
I'm only sixteen, 'tis a nice little age,
  I would not be younger or older
Already I've round over Love's mystic page,
  And warm'd when I should have grown colder.
I would like to be married, but, wedlock, they say,
  Has troubles which I've never seen;
So, I'd rather not barter my freedom away,
  For I've only just enter'd sixteen.

2.
I've done with young fops they are playthings at best,
  And please while around you they flutter;
The schoolgirls are getting to be quite a pest,
  And I warmly detest bread and butter.
I can smile on a man if he's not quite too old,
  Has whiskers, is noble in mein;
And I would not object to the music of golk,
  For I've only just enter'd sixteen.

3.
I hate an old maid--- yet, I don't wish to wed
  Until I have jilted my dozens;
And the beaus who had been by my glances misled,
  I'd give to my young country cousins.
Make hay while the sun shines, so wisely they say.
  Mine's bright, and my pasture is green;
I'll think of November--- though blooming in May,
  For I've only just enter'd sixteen.
