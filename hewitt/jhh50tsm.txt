1.
The ladies say I'm a handsome man,
  Tho' I have pass'd my prime;
I talk soft nonsense, flirt and fan,
  And in the dance keep time.
Yet I am a very lonely wight,
  Life seems a weary span;
I sit and mope all day and night,
  For I am a single man;

REFRAIN
I sit and mope all day and night,
  For I am a single man.

2.
I met the club, but nobody seems
  To bid me welcome there;
The eyes of men have no love beams,
  And wine won't banish care.
I'm only at home when with the girls,
  I please them, when I can,
Admire their dresses, praise their curls,
  Enough for a single man.

REFRAIN
Admire their dresses, praise their curls,
  Enough for a single man.

3.
There's but one way to mend my case,
  And that is "double and quits;"
A pretty form and a smiling face,
  Would cure me of my fits.
Then ladies all - I'm up for sale,
  Do sweeten life's little span;
If you'll say "yes" I will not quail,
  I can't bear a single man!

REFRAIN
If you'll say "yes" I will not quail,
  I can't bear a single man!
