1. Teach me, O God, to know thy will,
With holy love my spirit fill;
I’d praise thee for the good of life,
And trust in thee thro’ foil and srife.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
And trust in thee thro’ toil and strife.
I’d praise thee for the good of life,
And trust in thee thro’ toil and strife.

2. Stay thou the tempest in my heart,
When fears arise and passions start;
When dire temptations crowd around,
May I in watch and pray’r be found.

3. And tho’ the world seems cold and chill,
I know thou art my Partner still,
That when the tempests ’round me roar,
Thou art my God, I ask no more.
