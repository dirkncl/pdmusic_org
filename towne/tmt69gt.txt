1. Dear Grannie is with us no longer!
  Her hair that was white as the snow,
Was parted one morning forever,
  On her head, lying, softly and low;
Her hands left the Bible wide open,
  To tell us the road she had trod
With waymarks like footsteps, to show us
  The way she had gone up to God.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Dear Grannie is with us no longer!
  Her hair that was white as the snow,
Was parted one morning forever,
  On her head, lying softly and low.

2. She had her own test, I remember,
  For people whoe’er they might be;
She spoke of the strangers about us,
  Who but lately come over the sea;—
Of “Laura” and “Lizzie” and “Jamie,”
  And stately old “Esselby Oakes.”
She listen’d and  whisper’d softly,
  “My dear, are those friends meetin’ folks?

3. When  Minnie came home from the city,
  And left heart and happiness  there,
I saw her close kneeling by Grannie,
  With the dear wrinkled hands on her hair;
Amid the low sobs of the maiden,
  Came softly the tremulous tone.
“He wasn’t like meetin’ folks, Minnie,
  Dear child you are better alone.”

4. And now from the corner we miss her,
  And hear that reminder no more;
But still forgotten, the echo—
  Comes to us from the far distant shore.
Till Sophistry slinks in the corner,
  Though, Charity, sweet, has her deep,
We feel if we wish to meet Grannie,
  ’Twere best to be meetin’ folks, too.
