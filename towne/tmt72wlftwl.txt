To Charles W. Dodge
"We Live for Those We Love" (1872)
Words by C. B. Harger
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
If from our hearts were stricken out
The name of those we hold most dear,
This world for us would lose its charm
And seem a desert waste and drear.
For us the birds would hush their trill,
And nature's face grow dark and chill.
For us the birds would hush their trill.

CHORUS
Ah--yes! there is within our hearts,
A germ of heav'ns own joy above;
Which binds to the angel throng:
We live for those whom most we love.
(whom most we love.)

2.
"We live for those whom we most love"
E'en though uncouscious be our aim,
Still, deep withing each bosom dwells
A dearly loved and cherished name
For which, as in life's work we plod,
We live and find our greatest good.
For which, as in life's work we plod,
We live and find our greatest good.

(CHORUS)

3.
Go watch the mother with her babe
Press'd closely to her loving breast!
Go mark how heav'nly joy appears
To bind her brow--a halo blest!
What need to ask for whom she lives?
Her tighten'd clasp her answer gives.
What need to ask for whom she lives?
Her tighten'd clasp her answer gives.

(CHORUS)

4.
"We live for those whom we most love"
Yes--'though we do not see them more,
Though an Angel wingss have borne away
Our loved ones, to the heav'nly shore...
Yet do we live for them--that we
May live _with_ them, eternally.
Yet do we live for them--that we
May live _with_ them, eternally.

(CHORUS)
