1. Savior, I will trust thee,
This shall be my song;
When the days are shortest,
When they’re dark and long,

When my friends are turest,
And my heart is glad,
When they’re false and fewest,
And my soul is sad.

2. Savior, I will trust thee,
This shall be my stay;
Stilling all my doubting,
Driving them away;

Holding my so closely,
To thy truth sublime,
That my soul shall ripen,
For the better chime.

3. Savior, I will trust thee,
Trust thee day and night;
Claim the blessed promise,
Which shall guide aright,

All things work together,
For my good I know,
Surely I may trust Him,
As I onward go.
