"The Gurgle of the Jug" (11 Aug. 1884)
Words and Music
by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912
(from "Musical Gems," No. 5)

1.
Of all the vile things some people will hug,
The vilest of things is an old fashioned jug;
It stealeth their bed, how ever so snug,
And drives them to sleep on some bit of a rug.

CHORUS
Oh! the gurgle of the jug, jug, jug,
As it fills the guzzler's mug, mug, mug,
Sweetest music for the "Plug," plug, plug,
Is the gurgle of the jug, jug, jug.

2.
For rich and for poor, it carries the drug,
That poison's the blood and that reddens the "mug;"
At the last they who drink their graves will have dug,
For into the lake they will stagger "Kerchug!"

(CHORUS)

3.
Oh! smash this old jug, this murderous jug;
Let out the vile stuff that you foolishly lug;
Put on the _Gough Harness_, and hitch up the tug,
No longer be hailed as "Sot" or, a "Plug."

(CHORUS)
