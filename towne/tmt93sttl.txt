1. We are traveling home
To that beautiful land,
Where the saints of the Lord
In his presence shall stand,
We are shielded by love,
And we joyfully sing,
For we eveer rejoice,
In our Savior and King.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Singing to the Lord,
Singing to the Lord,
Singing to the Lord,
(Oh,) bless his name,
Singing to the Lord,
Singing to the Lord,
Singing to the Lord,
(Oh,) bless his name.

2. On our merciful Lord
All our burdens are laid;
He has pardon’d oru sins,
And our ransom has paid,
We are resting in hope,
Not a sorrow we bear,
O ’tis sweet to abide
In his sheltering care.
