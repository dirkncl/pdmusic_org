No. 1.  I'M GOIN' TO HEV A QUILTIN BEE.

Enter Mrs. Shallow, with duster; dusts and rearranges furniture,
while she sings:

1.
I'm goin' to hev a quilin' bee,
I've gin the invitations
To moren a dozen, old and young,
O' neighbors and relations.
There's Mrs. Snaggs the deekin's wife,
That lives jest round the corner,
And Prudence Plump, the young school marm,
That boards with wider Horner.

2.
The wider, too, I hed to ask
I know she's fairly ichin'
To show that bran new dress o' hern,
But then she's good at stitchin'
The minister is comin' tew
To chat with Hezikiar,
Tho' I suspect he's ruther sweet
On darter Ann Mariar.

3.
To tell the truth, he might do wuss,
Mariar's mighty knowin';
If I dew say't, she's allers hed
The very best that's goin'.
She's stylish, tew, though folks dew say
Her head tew high she's kerried
This patch-work quilt here, I intend
To gin her when she's married.

4.
Law sakes! it's almost two o'clock;
They'll be here in a minit;
I hope they'll all go right to workl
I'm anxious to begin it.
That Hanner Wasp is allers sure
To keep one's ears aringin';
They won't half sew, alist'nin tew
Her buzzin and a stingin'.

(Rap at door.)  Mrs. Shallow throws duster and apron into an
adjoining room, smooths down her hair with both hands, and
opens door.  Enter Prudence Plump, followed closely by Rev.
Mr. Lovegood.  Mrs. Shallow__Why, how de dew, walk right in.
(Takes Mr. L's hat and says:)  Take this chair, Mr. Lovegood.
(Seats him at extreem left of stage.)  Let me hev your shawl
and bunnit, Prudence.  So glad to see yew.  Set right down
here and rest while I take care of your things and call Ann
Mariar.  (Seats Prudence as far as possible from Mr. L. and
then hurries out with wraps and is heard to call, "Ann Mariar!
Ann Mariar! come right down.  Prudence Plump and the minister's
in the parlor."  She then pokes her head in at the door glances
anxiously from one to the other as she says:) Ann Mariar's
dressin', but she'll be down in a minit.  I know you'll excuse
me while I look after the supper.  (Both respond in the
affirmative, and as soon as Mrs. S. is out of sight, they rise
and move toward table in center of stage, on which are books,
albums, etc. which they make a pretense of examining.  During
the song which follows, the old lady frequently pokes her head
in a the door, displaying a good deal of uneasiness at the turn
affairs are taking.

No. 2.

1.  (Prudence.)
Quilting bees the men declare
Tho' I think they're hardly fair,
Are but plans to tell and hear
Idle tales from far and near.
You, perchance, will seek to strow
Seed, that better fruit may grow.
[DUET with overlapping voices]
P.  You of course will seek to strow
    Seed that better fruit may grow.
L.  I of course will seek to strow
    Seed that better fruit may grow.

2.  (Lovegood.)
Nay, in gossip I've no part
I but seek to gain the heart.
Love that makes the world akin
Love, alone I seek to win.
Surely, Prudence, you must know
What the charm that lures me so.
[DUET with overlapping voices]
L.  Surely Prudence you must know
    What the charm that lures me so.
P.  Nay, indeed, why should I know
    What the charm that lures you so.

3.  (Prudence.)
That our gossiping you'd mend
I but clearly comprehend;
What the luring charms can be
I confess is mystery.
Ah! I've guess'd it:  you aspire
To the charms of Ann Maria
[DUET with overlapping voices]
P.  Ah! I've guessed it you aspire
    To the charms of Ann Maria.
L.  No, no, no, I don't aspire
    To the charms of Ann Maria.

4.  (Lovegood.)
Nay, in guessing, you have missed
Name of charm I can't resist.
Could I call that charmer mine,
Prudence bids me still decline,
Though her beauty trebled be,
Prudence Plump, I love but thee
[DUET with overlapping voices]
L.  Though her beauty trebbled be,
    Prudence Plump I love but thee.
P.  Though her beauty trebbled be,
    (_aside_) Oh! ... he loves but me.

5.  (Both.)
As through life our steps we wend,
Prudence still our path attend.
Loving good and shunning ill,
Happiness our hearts shall fill.
May our lives the years along
Peaceful glide with love and song
[DUET]
May our lives the years along
Peaceful glide with love and song.

_Enter Ann Maria and Mrs. Shallow.  Rap at door, enter the
rest of women._
    MRS. SHALLOW.  "Walk right in ladies."
    HANNAH WASP.  "Sakes alive! how tired I be!"
    MRS. SNAGGS.  (eagerly) My old goose, she [_others raise
       voices and drown hers._)
    WIDOW HORNE.  "Why, Prudence and the minister are here
       already.  Wall I declare for't."
    MRS. SHALLOW.  My darter, Ann Mariar-m-m-m.
    Other women, "M-m-m."
(_All this time they are laying off their wraps greeting
Prudence and the minister, etc. etc._)  The ladies at once
take place around the quilt, and go to work, Mrs. Snaggs again
remarking_: "My old goose she" _but Hannah Wasp interrupts to
say, amid breathless silence_:
"Do you know, ladies, they do say that Randy Sparks, she that
was Randy Grub, old Abe Grub's gal by his fust wife, ye know,
and I've hearn tell how as she might a bin alive yit if the
stingy old thing hadn't starved her to death -- thought's long's
she'd married a Grub, she'd hev a plenty, I s'pose -- and sure
enough, she did and too much, too, I reckon, of that kind.
    MRS. SHALLOW.  Dew tell.
    ANN MARIA.  Ye don't say so.
    WIDOW HORNER.  Wa'll, I declare for't.
MRS. SNAGGS.  (_not musch interested in gossip, sees a chance to
remark_:)  "My old goose she" _when Mrs. Shallow interrupts with_:
"That's what my darter, Ann Mariear, said.  She -- _Here Hezikiah,
who has quietly been an unobserved hearer sings_:

No. 3.

1.  (Hezikiah.)
Ho, ho, hom a woman's tongue
Gossip still will wag;
In the centre firmly hung,
Neither end may lag;
Still will slander spread and grow
Tongues are all atilt,
Seeds of scandal here to sow,
As you sew your quilt.

2.  (Hezikiah.)
Shallow wits will still be found
While the wide worlds wags,
Idle tales to carry round
Gossip never flags
If your foolish tongues were slit
Better far 'twould be,
Silencing your slandrous wit
At your quilting bee.
[_Ann Maria goes out to see to supper._]

3.  (Mrs. Shallow.)
Now Hezikiar jest you quit;
A saint you would provoke;
Because the women talk a bit
You needn't go and croak,
Too well I know the pumpkin pie
You're allers glad to see,
Sweetcake and tarts and pork and beans
You get at quiltin'-bees.
[_Ann Maria call supper-r-r-r!_]

4.  (Hezikiah.)
There, there, don't let us have a fuss,
Though when you get together
Why politics you might discuss
Or talk about the weather,
Come, we'll dissect your pumpkin pie
While gossip we abolish,
Instead of character we'll try
You're victuals to demolish.

(Mrs. Shallow.)
The monster let's demolish,
We'll gossip if we please,
You men we will abolish
From future quiltin' bees.
(Hezikiah.)
Your pies we will demolish,
With pleasure and with ease,
While gossip we abolish
Our appetites appease.

No. 4. [overlapping voices]
(Prudence and Lovegood.)
Peace, peace, peace,
Bid anger flee away,
Peace, peace, peace,
Bid anger flee away,

Love and peace, love and peace,
Love and peace
Love and peace
Yes, love and joy and peace.
O 'tis love ... 'tis love and joy and peace.
(Mrs. Shallow.)
The monster let's demolish.
We'll gossip if we please.
You men we will aboilish
From future quiltin' bees.
We'll gossip if we please.
We'll gossip if we please ... if we please.

With pleasure and with ease
While gossip we abolish
Our appetites appease.
Our appetites appease.
Your pies we'll eat with ease,
Yes, with ease ... yes, with ease ...
