1.
I remember thee well a sweet little child
So modest and gentle so lovely and mild.
Thy voice like a harp that yields to the breeze,
Where the zephyrs of spring stir the bloom on the trees!
No May bird's more happy, more joyous or free,
Sure all happy ones are related to thee!
A sweet little child, with bright sunny eyes,
A gem of the earth and an heir of the skies:
A sweet little child with bright sunny eyes
A gem of the earth and an heir of the skies.

2.
O, thy brow is so fair and arched with such grace
While crowning thy holy and heavenly face.
Thy lips they are like a a rose in the sun
And thy soft cunning laugh is a magical one;
There's bloom, on they cheek, and there's lovc in thine eyes,
For thou art a rich gift from Father on high,
A sweet little child, with bright sunny eyes,
A gem of the earth and an heir of the skies:
A sweet little child with bright sunny eyes
A gem of the earth and an heir of the skies.
