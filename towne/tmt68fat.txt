1.
Gone are the gloomyu ages,
When tyrants ruled alone--
When Freedom's voice, thro' all the earth,
Found not an answ'ring tone;
When error, like a darksome cloud,
Enveloped all the lands,
And truth could only find a shroud
At persecution's hands.

CHORUS
Freedom and truth!
God speed them both!
Their banners float unfurled;
Their battlecry has now begun
To echo round the world.

2.
Wide o're awaken'd nations
Their glorious voice is heard,
And as the mighty ocean waves,
By tempest waves are stirr'd
E'en so, beneach those clarion tones,
The nations rose from sleep,
And tyrants tremble on their thrones,
And anxious vigils keep.

(CHORUS)

3.
Ere long remotest nations
Shall listen to their voice,
And 'neath the influence of their sway,
Earth's farthest realms rejoice.
Then over all the ransomed world,
Truth's holy light shall shine,
And Earth's proud banners shall be furled
Before Immanuel's shrine.

(CHORUS)
