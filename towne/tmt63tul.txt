1. 
Oh! come and join our Union League,
Be true and faithful ever—
We’ll hold with firmest hearts the ties
Which traitors seek to sever.
We’ll follow with unfliching zeal
Our dear old flag unfolding;
Our standard e’er shall foremost be,
With loyal hands upholding.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Come pledge the heart, and pledge the hand,
We’ll give you friendly greeting,
We’ll for the glorious Union stand,
While rebels we’re defeating.

2. 
We’ll bravely fill the vacant ranks
Of Brothers gone before us;
While gently swaying on the breeze,
The Stars and Stripes float o’er us.
Our Eagle then shall onward soar,
All fearless and undaunted;
When on Secession’s Southern soil
Our standard firm is planted.

3. 
Oh! must we see our lovely homes,
In treach’rous hands now lying,
No! let’s be onward to the fight;
Now to the rescue flying.
We’ll love our land of Freedom long,
And hail disunion, never!
Three cheers for those who will uphold
Our “Union League” forever.
