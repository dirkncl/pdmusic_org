1.
Thy neighbor? It is he whom thou
  Hast power to | aid and | bless;
Whose aching heart or burning brow
  Thy soothing | hand may | press.

2.
Thy neighbor? 'Tis the fainting poor
  Whose eye with | want is | dim,
Whose hunger sends from door to door--
  Go thou and | succor | him!

3.
Thy neighbor? 'Tis the weary man,
  Whose years are | at their | brim,
Bent low with sickness, care and  pain--
  Go thou and | comfort | him!

4.
Thy neighbor? 'Tis the heart bereft
  Of every | earthly | gem;
Widow and orphan helpless left--
  Go thou and | shelter | them!

5.
Thy neighbor? Yonder toiling slave,
  Fetter'd in | thought and | limb,
Whose hopes are all beyond the grave--
  Go thou and | ransom | him!

6.
Whene'er thou meet'st a human form
  Less favor'd | than thine | own,
Remember 'tis thy neighbor worm
  Thy brother | or thy | son.

7.
Oh, pass not, pass not heedless ny!
  Perhaps thou I |canst re- | deem
The breaking heart from misery--
  Go, share thy | lot with | him.
