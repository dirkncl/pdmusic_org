1.
In God's name in ancient story,
Went His faithful ones to fight, (went His faithful one,)
And they gave to Him the Glory,
For the triumphing of right, (or right,)
In the name of God prevailing,
We go out to fight with sin, (fight with sin,)
By the help which is unfailing,
Victory at last to win, (to win).

CHORUS
In God's name, oh, war-cry glorious!
Shout it comrades to the sky, (shout it comrades, shout it,)
In His strength we'll stand vitorious,
While the foemen yeild and fly, (yield and fly).

2.
Lo, a mighty host before us,
Fierce and eager for the fray, (eager for the fray,)
He is God who reigneth o'er us,
In His name be strong today, (today,)
In His name, rouse up, my brothers,
Sin is beating at the walls, (at the walls,)
Do not trust the work to others,
Follow where thy duty calls, (where it calls).

(CHORUS)

3.
On the banner floating o'er us,
In the battle's fiercest din, (in the battle's din,)
In God's name, shall flash before us,
As we wage the fight with sin, (with sin,)
When the deadly cannon rattles,
And the shots fall thick as hail, (thick as hail,)
Oh, Thou God of many battles,
Trusting Thee we shall prevail, (prevail).

(CHORUS)
