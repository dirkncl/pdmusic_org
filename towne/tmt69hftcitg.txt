[QUARTET]
1. Away, quick away to the forest!
To the precincts of man bid adieu!
Of man with his toils and his troubles,
And nature’s wild lovliness view;
We skim o’er the light beaming water,
We tramp thro‘ the green twining shade;
Fill the day with our sports and at evening
Find rest in the camp of the glade.

[CHORUS sung twice after each QUARTET]
Then hurrah for the lake and the stream!
Hurrah for the green twining shade;
We’ll drink to our life in the forest,
We’ll drink to our camp in the glade.

[QUARTET]
2. The miner may gloat o’er his treasure,
And his tricks the base partyhacks ply;
What care we? the forest is round us,
Above us, the beautiful sky;
We shout and we sing in our joyance,
The smiles of all nature to aid;
And we lay wood and wave under tribute,
The rest in our camp in the glade.
