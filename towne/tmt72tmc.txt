"The Model Church" (1872)
Song with Chorus
Words by J. G. Saxe
Music by Thomas Martin Towne

1.
Well, wife, I've found the model church,
I've worshipped their today,
It made me think of good old time,
Before my hair was gray;
The meetin' house was fixed up
More than they were years ago;
But then I felt when I went in,
It was not built for show.

CHORUS
"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow."

2.
The sexton showed me to a seat;
Now way back by the door,
He knew that I was old and deaf,
As well as very poor;
He must have been a christian,
For he led me boldly through
The long aisle of that crowded church,
To find a pleasant pew.

*CHORUS
"Praise Him, all creatures here below."

3.
I wish you'd heard the singing, ah!
It had the oldtime ring;
The preacher said with trumpet voice,
Let all the people sing;
The tune was "Coronation,"
And the music upward rolled;
I thought I heard the angels,
Striking all their harps of gold.

CHORUS
"Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

4.
My deafness seemed to melt away,
My spirit caught the fire,
I joined my feeble, trembling voice,
With melodious choir;
And sang as in my youthful Days,
"Let angels prostrate fall;
"Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown him Lord of all."

CHORUS
"Bring forth the royal diadem,
and crown Him Lord of all."

5.
How swift the golden moments fled
Within that holy place,
How brightly beamed the light of heav'n
From ev'ry happy face.
Again I longed for that sweet Time
when friend shall meet with friend;
"When congregations ne'er break up,
And Sabbaths have no end."

CHORUS
"When congregations ne'er break up,
and Sabbaths have no end."
