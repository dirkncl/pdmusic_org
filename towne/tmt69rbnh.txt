1. There are groves where the cool shadows linger,
Where the breezes are freighted with calm,
And the streams thread the plain with their silver,
Each ripple the mote of a  psalm;
A land where life’s tumult is over—
Its sorrow, and longing, and grief—
A land where the spirit, unresting,
Is bathed in a wonderful peace.
But not here— no, no! ’tis not here!
But not here! ’tis not here.

2. No, not here, where life’s battle is raging,
And shadows drift into our way—
Where success or defeat mind be written
At the close of  every day.
The cry of the great world is onward,
And on without pausing to rest;
But toiling will one day be over,
And the heart of the weary be blest.
But not here— no, no! ’tis not here!
But not here! ’tis not here.

3. There are wandering feet to be guided
From sin to the beautiful way;
And sad, lonely eyes to be lighted
By gleams from a perfected day
Our own lives each day to be chisel’d
To symmetry, Godlike and pure.
So the work which in time we are dying,
Shall on thro’ the ages endure.
Rest not here— no, no! ’tis not here!
Rest not here! ’tis not here.

4. Then scatter the sunlight— what matter
Though you have but little of light—
Your words and your deeds way outblossom,
As stars in another’s dim light.
At the end of life’s rockwaste is lying,
A wonderful, beautiful land;
The rest, and the peace, and the glory,
Will come to your spirit like balm.
Rest up there— yes, yes! ’tis up there!
Rest up there! ’tis up there.
