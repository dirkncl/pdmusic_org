1. In the valley, lone and weary,
Wait we for the coming day;
When the clouds shall leave our heavens,
And the darkness flees away;

When the bosom of our sorrow,
Shall be filled with joy untold,
When our hope shall be fruition,
And the pearly gates unfold.

2. When the strain of angel­music,
Like a song upon the sea,
Greet the hearts of pilgrims longing,
For the home that is to be,

When the flutt’ring robes of loved ones,
With a star on ev’ry fold,
Shine like suns, we’ll bless our sorrow,
When the pearly gates unfold.

3. When upon the Throne of Glory,
Jesus’ kingly form we see,
And the rainbow of his pressence,
Throws its glory o’re the lea,

Where the heaven­flow’rs are blooming,
And the heart can ne’er grow old,
With our trembling souls we’ll praise him,
When the pearly gates unfold.
