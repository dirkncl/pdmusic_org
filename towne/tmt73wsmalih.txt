To My Wife Isabella.
"We Shall Meet and Love in Heaven" (1873)
Words by Bella French.
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912.

1.
"When this life on earth is ended,
And I've crossed the misty sea.
I shall love you still in Heaven,"
So my loved one said to me.
On one bonny April morning,
In the hopeful long ago;
As we stood where apple blossoms
showered down like flakes of snow.

CHORUS
When this life on earth is ended,
And we've crossed the misty sea;
We shall meet and love in Heaven,
So my loved one said to me;
We shall meet and love in Heaven,
So my loved one said to me.

2.
And I laughing made the answer,
"Oh! your love has priceless worth,
If it lives through all the changes
Of a life upon this earth."
But he whispered just as softly,
Just as sweetly as before:
"We shall meet and love in Heaven."
When our earth-life shall be o're.

(CHORUS)

3.
"We shall meet and love in Heaven,
Yes those were the words he said.
And today he cannot tell you,
If I am alive or dead.
Since that morn the apple blossoms
By the April breezes blown,
Oft have dropt in snowy showers
But they fell on me alone.

(CHORUS)

4.
He has gone, but where he wanders,
I shall never, never know,
It may be 'mid southern flowers,
It may be through fields of snow,
But alas! today it matters
Now what lands he travels o'er;
We shall meet I know in Heaven
Though on earth we meet no more.

(CHORUS)
