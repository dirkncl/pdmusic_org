"The Little Newsboy" (1878)
Words by Mrs. V. J. Kent
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
Out from home at peep of day,
See the little newsboy come,
Not to loiter or to play,
Not in idleness to roam;
He on business is intent,
Has an eye to cents and dimes,
For the trade he represents,
Is the great one of the times.

REFRAIN
Trib-e-une, Times, In-ter-O-cean!
(Spoken:) Have a paper?
All about the murder and the suicide!
(Spoken:) Times?
Eve-nine Jour'nl! Five e-clock edition!
Have a Daily News? One cent!
(Spoken:) Paper, sir?

2.
Toilet rather incomplete,
What cares he for coat or shoes,
What cares he for muddy street,
Folks are waiting for the news;
Quick he jumps on 'bus or car,
Spite of all discouragement,
Looking for a customer,
"Have a Daily News--one cent!"

(REFRAIN)

3.
Be it murder, fire or war,
"Full account" he always cries,
Tells us where the tempests roar,
When a good man fails or dies;
All seems glib upon _his_ tongue,
Whether things go ill or well,
Whether men do right or wrong,
Yet his papers he must sell.

(REFRAIN)

4.
Does he ever weary get
Of the hurry and the strife?
Ever hungry, cold or wet?
Ever tired, too, of life?
Yes, for 'tis a _lonesome_ way,
Living on these busy streets,
Going oft at close of day,
Where no friendly welcome greets.

(REFRAIN)

5.
Turn him not away in scorn,
He is honest in his toil,
Labors hard from early morn,
Not much chance for gain or spoil,
Nor a favor does he ask,
Only brings you what you need;
Think it then, no boon or task,
Pass your nickle,--sit and read.

(REFRAIN)
