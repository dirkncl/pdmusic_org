[Soprano]
1. Those sweet blue eyes, those sweet blue eyes,
As clear as summer’s, summer’s happy skies.
They shine in beauty like the gems
That gleem in queenly diadems
When first their light upon me shine
I was a weary wan’rer lone 
With none to cheer
With none to smile
Or stay the flow of sorrow’s Nile. 
[Alto]
1. Those sweet blue eyes, those sweet blue eyes
As clear as summer’s happy skies, as happy skies
They shine in beauty like the gems
That gleam in queenly, queenly diadems
When first that light upon me shone.
With none to cheer, to cheer,
With none to smile
Or stay the flow, the flow
Of sorrow’s Nile.
[Tenor]
1. Those sweet blue eyes,  those sweet blue eyes, 
those sweet blue eyes, those sweet blue eyes,
As clear as summer’s happy skies
They shine in beauty like the gems
That shine in queenly diadems, iin diadems.
I was a weary wand’rer lone
With none to cheer, with none to smile,
With none to cheer, with none to smile,
Or stay the flow of sorrow’s Nile,
Of sorrow's Nile.
[Bass]
1.’Those sweet blue eyes, those sweet blue eyes,
Those sweet blue eyes, those sweet blue eyes,
As clear as summer’s happy skies, as summer happy skies,
They shine in beauty like the gems
That gleam in queenly diadems, in queenly diadems
With none to cheer, with none to smile, 
With none to cheer, with none to smile,
Or stay the flow of sorrow’s Nile,
Of sorrow’s Nile.

2. How oft with mem’ry linger near
To gem the time, the place, the place, the year
I met thy sweet endearing smile
Within thy peaceful seagirt isle
Long, long may love’s mosr hopeful blue
Tint future years with bliss for you
And linger ever on my skies
The clear sweet light of thy blue eyes.

2. How oft wil memry, memry linger near
To gem the time, the place, the year, the place, the year,
I met thy sweet endearing smile
Within thy peaceful, peaceful seagirt isle
Long, long may love’s most hopeful blue
And linger ever, ever on my skies
The clear sweet light, sweet light
Of thy blue eyes.

2. How oft will memry linger near,
How oft will memry linger near,
To gem the time, the place, the year
I met thy sweet endearing smile
Within thy peaceful seagirt isle, thy seagirt isle.
Tint future years with bliss for you
And linger ever on my skies,
And linger ever on my skies,
The clear sweet light of thy blue eyes
Of thy blue eyes.

And linger ever on my skies,
The clear sweet light of thy blue eyes,
Of thy blue eyes.
