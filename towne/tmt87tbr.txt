1. Oh, how sweet is the song of the angels,
The anthem that never will cease,
As they walk by the beautiful river,
That flows through the kingdom of peace.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We shall meet by that beauriful river,
The Savior has bidden us come,
We are saved, in his kngdom forever;
The kingdom of peace is our home.

2. There is rest, that is promised the weary,
From sorrow, eternal release;
It is found by the beauriful river,
That flows through the kingdom of peace.

3. Oh, how bright are the crowns of rejoicing,
The joy that will ever increase,
Of the throng by the lifegiving river,
That flows through the kingdom of peace.
