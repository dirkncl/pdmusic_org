1. Down by the river our log hut stands,
Where father and mother once dwelt
And the old door latch that was worn by our hands,
And the church wherein we knelt.
Years, years have passed since that happy time,
But the river keep rolling along—
And the rippling sound on the mossy bank,
Is singing the same old song.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Row, row, row your boat,
Gently down the stream
All that’s past is gone you know,
The future’s but a dream.

2. There stands the tree that we used to climb,
The mill with its clatter and din,
And the old wharf boat, ever there used to float,
Where the school boys used to swim.
High grows the grass on the master’s grave
And the river keeps rolling along—
And the birds and bees, and the blooming trees,
Are singing the same old song.
