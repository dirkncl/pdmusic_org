1. 
I would not die early, the harvest is white,
And fain would I labor from morning till night;
I’d follow the reaper and glean what he leaves,
And homeward at ev’ning return with my sheaves.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
I would not die early, I ask not to go
Till I have done something for Jesus below;
To those who are faithful, the promise is sure,
And rest will be sweeter to those who endure.

2. 
I would not die early, I long to fulfil
The Savior’s commission, if such be his will;
“Go, spread the glad tidings, salvation is free,
And none are rejected who comes unto me.”

3. 
I would not die early, but if it be mine,
In youth’s merry morning this life to resign;
I know my Redeemer will meet me with joy,
And give me to heaven some blessed employ.
