To Miss Mary C. Overacre, of Kenosha, Wisconsin
"Mary'll Meet Me at the Door" (1865)
Song & Chorus
by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
When low the dusty shadows lean,
And softly brush the wave and shore,
I blithely cross the village green,
To meet my Mary at the door;
And when my heart is free from care,
And full of thoughts that go before,
I keep my earnest ones for her,
The one that meets me at the door.

CHORUS
All thro' the long bright summer days,
A song comes fleeting evermore,
And sings to me of that sweet time
When Mary'll meet me at the door;
When Mary'll meet me at the door;
When Mary'll meet me at the door;
And sings to me of that sweet time, that sweet time
When Mary'll meet me at the door.

2.
My Mary bears no thought of wrong,
She sings when clouds of trouble tower,
And always, has a smile for me,
Whenever I meet her at the door;
And if I reach a hope of mine,
And hurl my life on its bright shore,
I'm sure my Mary'll meet me there,
And lead me thro' its golden door.

(CHORUS)
