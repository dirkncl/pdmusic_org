Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.--Matt. 5:16.

1. Now trim your lamp for Jesus, 
Let not your light be dim;
Full well he knows each action
That you may do for him.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Then trim your lamp for Jesus,
And to your faith be true;
The world will judge of Jesus
By what they see in you.

2. Now trim you lamp for Jesus,
Nor let it hidden be;
Be not asham’d of Jesus,
He’s not asham’d of thee.

3. Now trim you lamp for Jesus,
’Tis he who bids you shine;
And his shall be the glory,
A crown of life be thine.

4. Then trim your lamp for Jesus,
Nor deem it o’er a cross
To bravely shine for Jesus
’Mid earthly sin and loss.
