1. We come to worship thee, O Holy One,
Thy gracious name to own and bless;
Before they throne in thankfulness we bow,
Thy loving kindness to confess.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
We come, come again, we come, come again
To praise the Lord, our King;
We come, come again, we come, come again
His matchless love to sing.

2. Send down Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, we pray,
To move our wayward hearts to thee;
Fill us with sympathy and purpos true,
That faithful helpers we may be.

3. While here we mingle with sweet song and pray’r,
We gather strength for daily need;
O Savior, keep us all in duty’s path,
And to the heav’nly mansions lead.
