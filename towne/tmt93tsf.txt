1. God notes the little sparrow’s fall,
Not one doth lowly lie
But that in tend’rest care and love
He views it from the sky.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Yes, God who made the mighty world,
And all things great and small,
Doth ever note with tend’rest care
The little sparrow’s fall.

2. And shall he not take thought of all
His children day by day?
And watch and guard and care for them
Where­ ever they may stray?

3. Then trust in him who fain would teach
His love and care for all
By this sweet tho’t he e’en doth not
The little sparrow’s fall.
