1. Where skies of peace and blessing smile like angels o'er the land,
And wisdom is the spirit ruling by a princely hand,
The nation owes its greater debt to one unknown to fame,
Who pledged her babe to truth and right and Kingship's purest aim.

QUARTET [sung after each verse]
The people's proudest banner is with living words impearled,
"The hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that rules the world!
REFRAIN
The hand that rocks the cradle (the hand that rocks the cradle)
is the hand that rules the world (is the hand that rules the world)."

2. The eloquence which moves the throng from pulpit and from bar,
The potent ministries which bear the balm of life afar,
The masters who with noble brush have purified their art,
Are but the echo of the life within a mother's heart.

3. The pioneers whose faith and works with purpose grand combine,
Are sons in whom a mother's earnest councils burn and shine:
The gallant ship of state sails on enwreathed with vernal airs;
The breath that wafts it is a gentle gentle mother's faithful  prayers.

4. The thoughts that spur our noble men to stem the tide of wrong,
To save by love and logic all the downward sweeping throng,
And float the flag of temp'rance from the citidels of truth,
Were born within a mother's soul and nursed with tender ruth.
