1.
They have sown their seeds of freedom
On the furrowed field of battle,
And we'er waiting for the coming of its glorious harvest prime;
Though the day be long and cheerless,
Yet the patient soul is fearless,
For the harvest never ripens till the full appointed time;

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
And the summer time is coming!
Freedom's harvest time is coming!
Manhood's triumph, Labor's guerdon, and the promised better day!
Freedom's harvest time is coming!
And the promised better day!
Freedom's harvest time is coming!
And the promised better day!

2.
Though the back is often weary,
And the burden may be heavy,
Yet the fullness of the harvest will be recompense and pay;
Though the sowers faint or falter,
Sun and season will not alter,
And the reapers-- they will bless us for the gladness of their day.

3.
Then be patient and be hopeful,
Strong to suffer and to labor,
With a manhood that is worthy of the promise bending down;
Not alone the sunny weather,
But the storm and sun together
Ripen grain and ripen manhood for the noblest use and crown;
