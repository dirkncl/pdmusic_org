1. Something for Jesus! oh, what shall it be,
Savior of mine, that I offer to thee?
Gifts would I bring ere the day groweth late;
But I am poor, and the debt is so great!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Something for Jesus!, of this shall it be,
Doing the work that is waiting for me.
Rise, O my heart, from thy sloth and thy sleep,
Something for Jesus to sow and to reap.

2. Something for Jesus! he whispers to me,
“Look all about thee, and work thou wilt see.
Wake from thy dreaming,  no longer delay,
Forth to the field and work bravely today.”

3. Something for Jesus! oh, labor to bring
Wandering sould to the feet of the King,
Saying, “Dear Savior, from byways of sin,
Lo, I have gather’d these wanderers in.” 3.

4. Something for Jesus! thy gift may seem poor,
Be it thy best, he will ask for no more.
Thus to the Master they gratitude prove,
Paying the debt of his infinite love.
