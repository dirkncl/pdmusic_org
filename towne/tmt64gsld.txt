1.
Gracious Spirit, love divine,
Let Thy light within me shine;
All my guilty fears remove,
Fill me full of heaven and love.

2.
Speak Thy pardoning grace to me,
Set the burdened sinner free;
Lead me to the Lamb of God,
Wash me in his precious blood.

3.
Life and peace to me impart!
Seal salvation on my heart;
Breathe Thyself into my breast,
Earnest of immortal rest.

4.
Let me never from Thee stray,
Keep me in the narrow way;
Fill my soul with joy divine,
Keep me, Lord, forever thine.

[CODA]
Amen.
