Dedicated to Rev. J. Stoughton.
"Is Rum to Be King" (5 Dec. 1882)
Song and Chorus.
Words by Mattie Pearson Smith.
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912.

1.
Is Rum to be King of the Nation,
O sons of your patriot sires?
Will you in the dust tamely grovel
And bend to the tyrant's desires?
Can you lock on the land you inherit,
And barter sweet liberty's smile,
While the best and purest is trampled
Neath the foot of a depot so vile?

CHORUS
No! no! no! no!
A million brave voices are shouting ...
We'll draw our bright swords while we may ...
And we'll smite, while the great God of battles ...
Will stand by our side in the fray.

2.
Is Rum to be King of the Nation,
That flaunts her proud flag to the world?
Her stars and her stripes the bright emblem
That liberty long hath unfurled?
Is Rum to be King while the greensward
Is red with the blood of the brave?
When yet o'er the hills sing the echoes
Of the shouts that their victory gave?

CHORUS
No! no! no! no!
Sons of freedom, O shout till the echoes ...
Proclaim to the world evermore ...
That ne'er shall the foot of the tyrant ...
Be planted on Liberty's shore!

3.
Is Rum to be King of the Nation,
The grandest on all the wide earth?
Whose sons and whose daughters were cradled
In times that but fostered their worth?
Can these rivet chains for their children,
And leave but a record of shame?
Can these to their graves go dishonored
And leave so ignoble a fame?

CHORUS
No! no! no! no!
A million brave voices are shouting ...
We'll draw our bright swords while we may ...
And we'll smite, while the great God of battles ...
Will stand by our side in the fray.
