"Winnie Dell" (1882)
Quartet for Mixed Voices.
Words by Rev. A. A. Hoskin
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
Sweetly smiled the blooming meadow;
Rang the woodlands all at-tune;
Earth was bright as it is never,
But beneath the skies of June.
But of all the buds that blossomed
In that June we loved so well,
To our hearts the brightest, sweetest,
Was our Winnie, (gentle Winnie,) Winnie Dell.

CHORUS [with overlapped voices]
[SOPRANO]
Winnie, Winnie Dell,
Gentle Winnie Dell,
To our hearts the sweetest blossom,
Was our Winnie Dell.
To our hearts the sweetest blossom,
Was our Winnie Dell.
[ALTO and TENOR]
Winnie, Winnie, gentle Winnie Dell.
Winnie, Winnie, gentle Winnie Dell.
To our hearts the sweetest blossom,
Was our Winnie gentle Winnie Dell.
To our hearts the sweetest blossom,
Was our Winnie gentle Winnie Dell.
[BASS]
Winnie, gentle Winnie, gentle Winnie Dell.
Winnie, gentle Winnie, gentle Winnie Dell.
To our hearts the sweetest blossom,
Gentle Winnie, gentle Winnie, gentle Winnie Dell.
To our hearts the sweetest blossom, sweetest blossom,
Was our gentle, was our gentle, gentle Winnie Dell.

2.
Breathed again the chilly autumn,
O'er the earth his frosty breath;
Faded then the bright June blossoms;
All their brightness veiled in death.
Twice again to spring's embraces,
Did the buds to blossom swell,
While our bud grew fairer, sweeter,
Gentle Winnie, (gentle Winnie,) Winnie Dell.

(CHORUS)

3.
But once more the blooming meadows,
Withered 'neath November's blast.
Then the darkness of life's autumn,
Gathered round our hearts at last.
Blighted buds and withered blossoms,
Robbed of all their brightness fell;
But of all their number, sweetest,
Was our Winnie, (gentle Winnie,) Winnie Dell.

(CHORUS)

4.
There they laid her in the church yard;
Flow'rs shall bloom around her bed;
Birds shall poise on airy pinions,
Sweetly singing o'er her head.
But where flowers bloom unfading,
Where the angels sing and dwell,
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie, (angel Winnie), Winnie Dell.

CHORUS [with overlapped voices]
[SOPRANO]
Angel Winnie Dell, Angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
[ALTO and TENOR]
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
[BASS]
Winnie, angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
Winnie, angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
Hers is now a June immortal,
Angel Winnie, angel Winnie, angel Winnie Dell.
