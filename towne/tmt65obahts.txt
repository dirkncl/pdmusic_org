1.
No more we sing the olden song, 
  "Our boys are coming home,"
No more we cry how long, how long,
  When will the lov'd ones come?
No longer faint with hope deferr'd,
  We wait, and watch, and pray,
For now we know our pray'rs were heard,
  Our boys are home to stay.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The weary, weary night is past,
  All hail the joyful day,
Our boys are home, safe home at last,
  Our boys are home to stay.
Our boys are home to stay.
  Our boys are home to stay.
Our boys are home to stay.
  Our boys are home to stay.

2.
The long embrace, the fond caress,
  The love kiss on the cheek:
More eloquent that words express
  The joy we cannot speak;
Sweep, sweep the keys, let music pour
  Her choicest strains today,
Our gallant boys are home once more,
  Our boys are home to stay.

3.
List! List! methinks a martyr throng
  Low bending from the skies,
Are mingling with our earthly song
  Sweet strains from Paradise!
"Our life blood freely paid the cost,
  Peace reigns on earth today,
Your missing loved ones are not lost,
  But gathered home to stay!"
