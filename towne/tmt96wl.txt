1.
'Tis love, 'tis love, 'tis wonderful love!
'Twas God's great love for me,
That sent the Savior from above,
My sacrifice to be!

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful love, (wonderful love,)
Wonderful, wonderful love, (wonderful love,)
That sent the Savior from above,
My sacrifice to be!

2.
'Tis love, 'tis love, 'tis wonderful love!
That fills my soul today;
'Tis love that follows where I rove,
That seeks me when I stray.

(CHORUS)

3.
'Tis love, 'tis love, 'tis wonderful love!
That casteth out all fear;
'Tis love that doth my song approve,
And whispers, "I am near."

(CHORUS)

4.
'Tis love, 'tis love, 'tis wonderful love!
Will take me home at last,
To sing love's praise thro' endless days,
When trials all are past.

(CHORUS)
