1.
Little acts of kindness,
Trifling though they are,
How they seem to brighten
This dark world of care!
Little acts of kindness,
O, how potent they,
To dispel the shadows
Of life's cloudy day.

2.
Little acts of kindness,
How they cheer the heart!
What a world of gladness
Will a smile impart!
How a gentle accent
Calms the troubled soul,
When the waves of passion
O'er it wildly roll.

3.
Little acts of kindness,
Nothing do they cost;
Yet when they are wanting
Life's best charm is lost!
Little acts of kindness,
Richest gems of earth,
Though they seem but trifles,
Priceless in their worth.
