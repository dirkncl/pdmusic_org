1.
I am waitin', love, under the elmens
That shelter'd us twain yesterday e'en
When you put both your dear arms around me
And called me your darlin' Katreen
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
And called me your darlin' Katreen
When you put both your dear arms around me
And called me your darlin' Katreen.

CHORUS
Mavourneed! Mavourneen!
And called me your darlin; Katreen
When you put both your dear arms around me
And called me your darlin' Katreen.

2.
Ah! the stream, love, is dancin' and laughin',
So gaily its high banks between
And the willows that over it bendin'
Are bonny with bonniest green,
My darling! My darling!
Such beautiful moonlighted green
And the willows that over it bendin'
Are bonny with bonniest green.

CHORUS
My darling! My darling!
Such beautiful moonlighted green
And the willows that over it bendin'
Are bonny with bonniest green.

3.
And the stars over head, love, are winkin'
With light in their beautiful e'en.
They are sayin' "remember the trystin'."
They're sayin' "remember yes-t'reen"
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
They're sayin' "remember yes-t'reen"
An' for sayin' "remember the trystin'."
They're sayin' "remember yes-t'reen."

CHORUS
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
They're sayin' "remember yes-t'reen"
An' for sayin' "remember the trystin'."
They're sayin' "remember yes-t'reen."

4.
I am true as that beautiful tree, love,
The pine, with its heart ever green;
An' for you, love, my own heart is beatin'.
I'm always your lovin' Katreen
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
The pine, with its heart ever green;
An' for you, love, my own heart is beatin'.
I'm always your lovin' Katreen.

CHORUS
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
The pine, with its heart ever green;
An' for you, love, my own heart is beatin'.
I'm always your lovin' Katreen.

5.
I will go to your cot by the elmens
That flicker with shadow and sheen.
I will greet you with smiles morn and even
Dear Brian, you'll bless your Katreen
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
Ah! yes, you shall bless your Katreen.
I will greet you with smiles morn and even.
Dear Brian, you'll bless your Katreen.

CHORUS
Mavourneen! Mavourneen!
Ah! yes, you shall bless your Katreen.
I will greet you with smiles morn and even.
Dear Brian, you'll bless your Katreen.
