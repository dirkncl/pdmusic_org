1. Weeing came a little maiden,
When the earth was sweet with May,
Through the fields of snowy daisies,
Where the shining dewdrops lay.
For her lost bird sadly calling,
Which had flown from careless hands;
Just across the narrow river,
Where the dark old linden stands.

2. Heedless of her silvery pleading,
Answered only by its songs,
She with wondrous rapture listened
For its notes so rich and strong.
Ne’er it sang when caged and tended—
”Sings it sweetest near the sky,“
Half in smiles and tears, she murmured,
“So I think God made it fly!” 

3. Autumn trailed o’er earth its splendor
When a weeping voice I heard,
Thrilling all my soul with anguish,
“I have lost my little bird!”
Mother, weep not! for an angel
On a silent mission sent,
Bore away thy little warbler,
Only for a season lent.

4. Listen! comes across the river,
By the spirit only heard,
Soothing strains of heavenly music,
From thy sweet immortal bird;
Sung to cheer thy sticken spirit
And attune it for the skies;
Where in sweet ascord ’twill mingle,
In the song of Paradise.
