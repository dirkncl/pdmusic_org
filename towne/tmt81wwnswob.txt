1. We will nevver sip, wine or beer,
Tempt us not, tempt us not;
We will never fight this foe we fear,
Tempt us not, tempt us not.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Drink that hurts us, new or old,
From out lips we will withhold;
Hour by hour, and day by day,
When we work and when we play.

2. We will never, treat, treat, night or day,
Tempt us not, tempt us not,
We will never try this sin to stay,
Tempt us, tempt us not.

3. We will never, buy, buy rum nor sell,
Tempt us not, tempt us not;
We will never fear the same to tell,
Tempt us, temp us not.
