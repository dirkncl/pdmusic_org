1. One more struggle;
brothers, meet it!
Be not cowards in the strife!
Each has int’rest in the issue,
More to gain or lose than life.
Ask none else to do your duty,
Do, yourself with willing soul;
Hist’ry’s pen, all bathed in glory,
Waits to write you on its roll.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
One more struggle; brothers, meet it!
Be not cowards in the strife!
Each has int’rest in the issue,
More to gain or lose than life.

2. One more struggle; brothers, face it!
Come, ye faithful ones and true!
Back, ye timid ones and doubting,
Work’d like this is not for you!
Willing hands must strike for temp’rance!
Faithful ones must overthrow,
Ev’ry wish that foes may cherish,
Ev’ry wish that drunkards know.

3. Shall your name with you be buried,
And your mem’ry die with you?
Why not join the glorious circle,
Of the world’s immortal few?
Why not have your deeds recorded
On the monument of fame?
Why not have the world your debtor,
For a noble life and name?

4. One more struggle, and the tramping
Of the battling host shall come;
One more struggle!
then the shining
Of the glorious sun of peace;
One more struggle!
who will hear it?
Who will haste the coming morn,
And be bless’d by living millions,
And by millions yet unborn?
