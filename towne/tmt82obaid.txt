"Our Boys Are in Danger!" (1882)
A Battle Song.
Temperance Song & Chorus
Dedicated to the CITIZEN'S LEAGUE of the U.S.A.
Words and Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
The boys are in danger! arise then today;
Protect them, ye fathers, from rum's potent sway;
Engrossed in the cares of the world and its joys,
Forget not, I pray you to watch o'er the boys.

CHORUS
Arise then! Arise then! and take a brave stand,
Against the vile traffic that stalks thro' the land;
Oh! watch o'er the boys, for well we do know
Through them we may conquer our one mighty foe!

2.
The boys are in danger! enlist in the war;
The smoke rolls around us from near and afar;
Oh! heed not the foe with his bluster and noise,
But burnish your weapons and fight for the boys.

(CHORUS)

3.
There's need of our purse while we further the cause
There's need of our prayers, and there's need of our laws;
Sustain then our statutes, our MINORS PROTECT,
The Lord will condemn, if our boys we neglect.

(CHORUS)
