A Descriptive Piece.
With Solos for Soprano and Tenor
and Quartet for Mixed Voices.
Words by O. A. Curtis.

[Moderato con affectuoso.]
1.
[Soprano Solo]
Homeless and friendless,
Frailest of forms,
Thinest of garments,
Fiercest of storms;
Thickly and swiftly
Falleth the snow;
Coldly and keenly,
Winter winds blow.

[Quartet, to sung without Accomp't.]
2.
O Stranger stop! a
mournful voice
From every
frozen tear,
Is speaking to your
hidden soul;
No home, and
night so near!

[Tenor Solo.]
[Faster.]
3.
"Only a beggar asking relief;"
"Then let her shiver
Ragged young thief."

[Soprano.]
Hark! the strong north wind
Beareth a groan,
On through the blackness,
Up to God's throne.
On through the blackness,
Up to God's throne.

[Quartet, to sung without Accomp't.]
4.
O father! hear that
plaintive prayer --
The world ne-
glects thy child,
O Christ, be thou her
comforter.
Though-out this
night so wild.

5.
[Soprano Solo]
Lifeless and soulless,
Shrouded in snow,
Angels from heaven
Watchers below,
Deathless and pangless,
Fairest of forms,
Richest of garment
Safe from the storms.

["The Angels' Song of Welcome."]
[Allegretto.]

[Quartet]
6.
Welcome home, welcome home,
your dreary night is past,
With God you're safe at last.
Welcome, welcome home,
Welcome home.

[Repeat Quartet, Verse 6]
