1. 
O God! how can I give him up?
Dear Paul, my pride, my joy,
The only one that’s left of seven,
The best, the bravest boy!
I cannot! this poor heart grows faint,
Just at the thought; but still,
His country needs him more than I;
I can, I must, I will!

2. 
But oh, I love, I love him so,
’Twill surely break my heart
To bid good bye to him, my son.
My friend, my all. To part
With the dread tho’t that on this earth
No more we’ll meet! but still,
His country needs him more than I;
I can, I must, I will!

3. 
Just now a voice spoke unto me:
“On Carolina’s shore
Are many of God’s children dear,
Whom slav’ry’s curse is o’er.”
My boy may help to break the chain,
’Tis hard to part, but still,
If freedom needs him more than I;
I can, I must, I will!

4. 
Then, freedom, unto thee I give
This true, brave boy of mine.
I yield him as thy right, for he,
I know, is also thine.
Full well I know, if he would fal,
Alone I’ll be; but still,
I will resign my all to thee;
I can, I must, I will!
