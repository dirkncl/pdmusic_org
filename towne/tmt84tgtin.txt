1.
Oh, hearken to the Savior's voice!
The golden time is now;
Obey His word, make Him your choice,
The golden time is now.
You take no rich in leaving sin,
In asking Christ to dwell within,
And give you sacred joy and peace;
Oh, sinner, come and find release!

2.
Give up thy love of self and pride,
The golden time is now;
Tho' all you comrades may deride,
The golden time is now.
E'en tho' you fail and die at last
In sin's embrace, all fettered fast,
'Twould be no worse than standing still,
And worshiping your own sweet will.

3.
In tender accents hear him call,
The golden time is now;
On bended knee before Him fall,
The golden time is now.
Your friends are off'ring fervent prayer,
That you their faith and love may share;
Oh, be persuaded here tonight
To take the stand of truth and right.
