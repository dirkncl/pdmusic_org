1. Action, action, action!
Is the word today;
Forward, forward, forward!
Now without delay;
Waiting not for others,
Hesitating slow,
Be the movers, leaders,
Into action go!

2. Courage, courage, courage!
Never faint nor flinch,
Onward, onward, onward!
Yielding not an inch;
Break the drunkard’s shackles,
Take him by the hand,
Banish drunkard makers,
Vote them from the land!

3. Watching, watching, watching,
Praying in your tears;
Hoping, hoping, hoping,
For the better years;
For a newborn nation,
Free from curse of rum;
Finding grandest triumph,
In the days to come!
