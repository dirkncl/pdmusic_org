1.
Oh, let not thy heart be sighin my dear,
Let not thy heart be pining,
For every cloud that's darksome and drear,
Surely has silver lining,
And now though thy heart be aching and sad,
'Tis but a could that's flying
Close over thy head and darkning thy soul,
Only thy faith it's trying.

CHORUS
Then let not thy heart be sighing my dear, be sighing, sighing my dear,
Let not thy heart, let not thy heart be pining pining pining,
For every could that's darksome and drear, that's darksome and drear,
Surely has silver lining.


2.
The flowers that bloom by earth's rough wayside,
Truly are kept from dying,
By sunshine and rain as well as the dew,
Glistning like tear drops crying,
You surely shall have bright flowers my dear,
Tears though their roots are flooding,
You surely shall see their blossoms at last,
Though they belong in budding.

(CHORUS)

3.
The year has its winter, frosty and cold,
Surely its days of freezing,
But soon comes the spring and harvest my dear,
Gladly our hearts appeasing,
Though now you are having keen frost and cold,
Wildly the snow is nearing,
Yet brightly in heav'n beams springtime my dear,
Ever our glad hearts cheering.

(CHORUS)

4.
Thy heart may be sad at evening my dear,
Seeming like dark forewarding,
But list to the promise given my dear,
Sweet shall come joy at morning,
Then let not thy heart be groping in night,
Always the sun is shining,
And every cloud that's darksome and drear,
Surely has silver lining.

(CHORUS)
