Dedicated to Miss Kittie Learned.
"We Should Hear the Angels Singing" (1871)
Song and Chorus.
by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912.

1.
If we only sought to brighten
Eve-ry pathway dark with care,
If we only tried to lighten
All the burdens others bear;
If we only strove to cherish
Eve-ry pure and holy thought,
Till within our hearts should perish
All that is with evil frought;

CHORUS
We shall hear the angels singing
All around us night and day;
We shall feel that they were winging
At out side their upward way.

2.
If it were our aim to ponder
On the good that we might win,
Soon our feet would cease to wander
In forbidden paths of sin;
If we only did our duty,
Thinking not what it might cost,
Then the earth would wear beauty,
Fair as that in Eden lost;

(CHORUS)
