1.
Do you remember, Oh, my friend,
  The days when we were young,
The church that stood upon the hill.
  The choir in which we sung!
The gallery so vast and high,
  Which never organ knew,
But had a flute and violin,
  And big base fiddle too.

CHORUS 2 times
The old, old choir; the dear old choir;
  Is broken up and gone;
But still the choir, the old church choir,
  In mem'ry fond lives on.

2.
When Father Willard tuned his strings,
  And gloried in the sound;
And on the merry boys and girls
  So rougueishly looked round.
Where Hepsa's clear soprano voice,
  Rose high in old Dundee;
Oh, "On the wings of mighty winds,"
  Those days come back to me.

(CHORUS)

3.
How sweet the Alto used to be,
  When Harriet and Maria
With mellow pure and liquid tones,
  Sang in the old church choir.
Do you remember John, my love,
  Whose ear did something lack,
He always sang the loudest with
  Whoe'er sang at his back.

(CHORUS)

4.
Have you forgot the trick we played
  On John and Gilbert, there,
The hoods we wore, we slyly changed,
  In coming down the stair;
And at the foot, deceived by this,
  Stood each expectant beau;
How dissapointed was each swain,
  That night so long ago.

(CHORUS)

5.
And now my friend, we're going gray,
  But still our hearts will fire
With memories of the times when we
  Both sang in that old choir;
And "Coronation," "Ortonville,"
  And other tunes we sung,
Will almost make us now believe
  That we again are young.

(CHORUS)
