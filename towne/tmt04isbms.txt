"I'll Stand By My School" (1904)
Words by Belle Kellogg Towne
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my hand,
Beside the public school to stand;
Its lessons I will learn with care,
And in its duties ever share.

CHORUS
This pledge, I will take, my life by it rule,
God being my helper, I'll stand by my school;
I'll stand by my school, I'll stand by my school,
God being my helper, I'll stand by my school.

2.
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my hand,
Beside the public school to stand;
From day to day, from week to week,
The truths it teaches I will seek.

(CHORUS)

3.
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my hand,
Beside the public school to stand;
And officers and teachers kind,
In me a helper true shall find.

(CHORUS)

4.
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my hand,
Beside the public school to stand;
Nor will I tempted be to roam
From this my pleasant study home.

(CHORUS)
