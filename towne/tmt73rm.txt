1.
Farm-er’s haste de-fend your free-dom,
Which the Rail-roads threat-en now,
Leave your flocks and herds, ye free-men,
Leave the mat-tock and the plow.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Break ye th’op-pres-sors band,
And join-ing heart and hand,
Rid, rid our hap-py land of Rail-road Mo-nop-o-ly.

2.
What are all our homes and treas-ures
Which we’ve gained by sweat and toil?
What our farms with their broad a-cres
Wav-ing fields and fer-tile soil?

3.
What to us the wealth of a-ges,
Na-ture stores in man-y’a mine,
While a-gainst our rights as free-men
Rail-road men their wealth com-bine?

4.
Why en-slave our sons and daught-ers,
To ad-vance the cru-el wrong?
Break the ‘op-pres-ors’ bands of i-ron
Which have bound us now so long!
