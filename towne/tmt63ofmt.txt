1. Oh, time is sweet when roses meet,
With spring’s sweet breath around them;
And sweet the cost when Hearts are lost
If those we love have found them.
And sweet the mind that still can find
A star in darknest weather;
O, naught can be so sweet to see,
As old friends meet together.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Old friends, old friends,
Old friends meet together,
But naught can be so sweet to see,
As old friend meet together.

2. Those days of old, when youth was bold,
And time stole wings to speed it,
When youth ne’er knew how fast time flew,
Or knowing did not heed it.
Tho’ grey each brow that meets us now,
For age brings wintry weather,
Yet naught can be as sweet to see
As those old friends together.

3. The few long known, that years have flown,
With hearts their friendship blesses,
A hand to cheer, perchance a tear,
To soothe a friend’s distresses!
That helped and tried, still side by side,
A friend to face hard weather;
Oh! thus may, we yet joy to see,
And meet old friends together.
