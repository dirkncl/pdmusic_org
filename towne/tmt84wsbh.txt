1. We are journ’ying day by day,
  To the hills whereon is rest;
Lo! behold them far away,
  In the country of the blest.
Never night or tempest there,
  Never sorrow, never sin;
Never any load to bear;
  Open, gates, and let us in!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Courage, heart! the way  grows bright,
  Thinking of the joy to come,
Heav’n breaks on our raptur’d sight,
  We will soon be safe at home!

2. Does the way seem rough and long?
  Are you weary, faint and worn?
Sing of rest, and in the song,
  Half forget the burdens borne.
Sing of joy that we shall know,
  When we pass the gates, and see
That dear Christ, who lov’d us so,
  That He died for you and me.

3. Oh, the hills of peace and rest,
  On the river’s farther shore,
In the country of the blest,
  Land of God’s forevermore!
Nearer, nearer, day by day,
  To the heav’n, the faithful win,
Soon our Father’s voice will say,
  Open, gates, and let them in!
