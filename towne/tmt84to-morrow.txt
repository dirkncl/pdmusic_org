1.
Of all the words man ever heard,
The one that bringeth sorrow,
Is this oft used and much abused,
This simple word, _to-morrow_.

CHORUS
Oh, word of words, so often heard,
To-morrow, to-morrow!
It bringeth some sweet joy and peace,
To others deathless sorrow.

2.
Oh, do not wait! you know "_too late!_"
Has often been the cry;
Then, halting one, come home, come home,
To-morrow you may die.

(CHORUS)

3.
Do not delay, decide today,
And harden not your heart;
Forsaking all on Jesus' call,
Oh, choose the better part!

(CHORUS)

4.
To-morrow's morn may never dawn,
Today may be your last;
It may be said, "Oh, he is dead,
His day of grace is past!"

(CHORUS)
