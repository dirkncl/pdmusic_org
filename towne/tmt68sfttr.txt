1.
QUARTET
Softly fades the twilight ray,
Of the holy Sabbath day,
Gently as, life's setting sun,
When the Christian's course is run.

2.
SOLO for Soprano
Peace is on the world abroad;
'Tis the holy peace of God,
Symbol of the peace within,
When the spirit rests from sin.

3.
CHORUS
Savior, may our Sabbaths be,
Days of peace and joy in thee;
Till in heaven our souls repose,
Where the sabbath ne'er shall close.
