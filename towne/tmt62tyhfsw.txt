1.
This the word beyond all others,
Makes us love our country most!;
Makes us feel that we are brothers,
And a heart united host!
With hosannas let our banner
From the housetops be unfurled,
While the nation holds her station
With the mightiest of the world!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Take your harps from silent willows,
Shout the chorus of the free;
“States are all distinct as billows,
Union one— as is the sea!”

2.
From the land of groves that bore us
He’s a traitor that would swerve!
By the flag now waving o’er us,
We the compact wull preserve!
Those who gained it, and sustained it,
We unto each other true,
And the fable well is able
To instruct us what to do!
