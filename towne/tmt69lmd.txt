1. Love me dearest, when no more
The garb of spring I wear,
Love me still as thou didst when
I was so young and fair;
Love me dearest when those eyes
Grow dim from watchful hours,
When no more for thee I cull
The last and first sweet flowers.

CHORUS [sung twice after each VERSE]
Love me dearest, let thy heart
Still fondly cling to me,
Like a shelt’ring vine around,
A young and tender tree.

2. Love me dearest, when old time
Hath stole  my riglets  fair,
And left naught to deck my brow,
But snowy lock of hair;
Love me dearest, when for thee
I can no longer sing,
When my harp shall be unstrung
Like some forsaken thing.

3. Love me dearest, love me more
Than when I was thy bride,
Till my pilgrimage is o¦er,
And I have quit thy side;
Love me dearest, when I steal
Beyond that mystic sea,
O’er its deep I’ll whisper back
Undying love to thee.
