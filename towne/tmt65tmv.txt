1.
A merry peal upon the bells,
  Proclaims the nation's jubilee,
In joyous tones triumphant swells,
  Th'exultant song of victory;
The crowd take up the glad refrain,
  I listen with suspended breath,
Ah me! my heart, 'tis all in vain,
  That missing voice is hush'd in death. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
That missing voice, that missing voice,
No more I hear its thrilling tone,
What though all earth and heav'n rejoice,
I turn aside and weep alone (weep alone).

2.
Once more the deep-ton'd sabbath bell
  Rings out upon the stilly air,
And with the last slow measured knell,
  I seat me in the house of pray'r;
Sweet voices blend in sacred song,
  While bitter tears my eyes o'erflow,
Ah me! my God, forgive the wrong,
  Their music only mocks my woe.

3.
The vesper bell at twilight dim,
  Bids us unite in praise and prayer;
How can I join that evening hymn,
  Or kneel beside that vacant chair,
My lips are sealed, my heart is chill,
  At home, abroad, by night or day,
That missing voice it haunts me still,
  I cannot praise, I cannot pray.

CODA (for last verse)
I turn aside and weep alone,
I turn aside and weep alone,
and weep alone, and weep alone,
and weep alone, and weep alone.
