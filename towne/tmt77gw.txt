Words by Margarette W. Snodgrass
Music by Thomas Martin Towne, 1835-1912

1.
Good will toward men,
The angels sang,
Thro'out the earth
The echos rang,
Good will to men from heaven,
Good will to men from heaven.

CHORUS
Good will (Good will,)
Good will, (good will,)
good will to men from heaven;
Good will (Good will,)
Good will, (good will,)
good will to men from heaven;

2.
Such gift of joy,
No heart must keep,
Broad cast the seed,
If thou woulds't reap
The harvest in rejoicing,
The harvest in rejoicing.

(CHORUS)

3.
Ring out good will
From day to day,
To toiling pilgrims
By the way,
And speed them on their journey,
And speed them on their journey.

(CHORUS)

4.
The hearts that fill
Will overflow,
And scatter joy,
Where'er they go,
Good will and gladsome greeting,
Good will and gladsome greeting.

(CHORUS)

5.
And when, at last,
The journey done,
The danger past,
The vict'ry won,
We join the angel chorus,
We join the angel chorus.

(CHORUS)
