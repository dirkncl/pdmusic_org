1. Up, my brother, duty calls you,
Fields are gleaming white;
Lend a hand to help the reaping,
While the day is bright.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Work for the Master, 
Haste, de not delay!
Wait not the morrow, 
Jesus calls today!
Work with your might,
And trust the Savior dear,
Work, for He’s ever near.

2. There are souls to help and comfort,
Weary of their sin;
In the strength of our Redeemer,
Bring the lost ones in.

3. There are selfish hearts to conquer,
Wayward lips to seal;
Struggle on for love of Jesus;
He will crown your zeal.
