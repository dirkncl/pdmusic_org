1. Be the present dark or bright,
Be the future as it may,
God’s own hand is guiding all,
He is guiding all the way.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
He is guiding, He is guiding, 
He is guiding all the way;
’Tis the hand that guides the world,
That shall guide me all the way.

2. Best it is to have Him Guide,
Knowing He cannot do wrong;
In His wisdom and His love,
He shall guide us all along.

3. Tho’ts that come from Him are pure,
Words He gives are ever right,
Works He does thro’ me endure,
God is wisdom, God is light.
