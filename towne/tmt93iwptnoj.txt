1. Jesus! I love thy charming name;
’Tis music to mine ear;
Fain would I sound it out so loud,
That earth and heav’n should hear.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
I will praise the name of Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Precious Name, precious Name, precious Name:
I will praise the Name of Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Precious Name, I will praise his Name, precious Name.

2. All that my loftiest pow’rs can wish,
In thou doth richly meet;
Not to mine eyes is light so dear,
Nor friendship half so sweet.

3. They grace still dwells upon my heart,
And sheds its fragrance there;
The noblest balm of all my wounds,
The cordial of my care.
