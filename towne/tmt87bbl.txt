1. There’s a gift so divine from the Father above,
This beautiful, beautiful life,
And I know that he means I shall fill it with love,
This beautiful, beautiful life.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, the treasure how rare!
How precious and fair
This beautiful life is to me;
Like a gem from the mine,
It shall shine, it shall shine,
This beautiful, beautiful life.

2. There are troubles, and trials, and sins to ensnare,
This beautiful, beautiful life,
And the Father expects me to guard it with care,
This beautiful, beautiful life.

3. There’s a heaven to win, worth a life to employ,
This beautiful, beautiful life,
And a mansion above where my soul shall enjoy,
That other more beautiful life
