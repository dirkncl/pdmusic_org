1. There’s a fresh little mound ’neath the willow
Where at evening I wander and weep,
There’s a dear vacant spot on my pillow
Where a sweet little face used to sleep;
There were pretty blue eyes, but they slumber
In silence beneath the dark mould,
And the little pet lamb of our number
Has gone in the heavenly fold,
  And the little pet lamb of our number
  Has gone to the heavenly fold. 

2. Do I dream when to sleep I behold her
With a beauty so fresh and divine,
And so close in my arms I enfold her
I can feel her soft cheek upon mine;
Oh, so loving those gentle eyes glisten
That my vision is lost in my tears,
And bewilder’d, enraptur’d, I listen
To a voice from the spirit’s bright spheres.
  And bewilder’d, enraptur.d, I listen
  To a voice from the spirit’s bright spheres. 

3. There is silence in parlor and chamber,
There’s a sadness in every  room,
But I know that the Father hath claimed her,
Yet all things seem burden’d with gloom;
But I’ll not be a comfortless mourner,
No longer brood over my pain;
For I know where the angels have bourne her,
And soon I shall see her again.
  For I know where the angels have bourne her,
  And soon I shall see her again.
