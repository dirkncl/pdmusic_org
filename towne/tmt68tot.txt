1.
In the maple grove, stands the old home still,
Now its beaten walls I see;
How the years have flown since I cross'd its sill
With the step of young childhood free.
The old door, half open, in welcome stands,
But its hinges no creak with rust --
It was wont to swing to the touch of hands,
That are now crumbling low in dust.

CHORUS 2 times
O! the old threshold! The old threshold,
Tho' decay'd and sunken low,
Still it brings to my heart sweet dreams of old,
And the footsteeps of long ago (long ago).

2.
Ah! my father, dear, us'd to cross it oft,
In the strength of his manhood's prime;
And the maiden linger'd with blushes soft,
In that doorway, full many a time;
As the low west wind from the far off hill,
Nestled 'mong the stray curls and slept,
And the prattling babe, at its own sweet will,
Has so gleefully o'er it crept.

(CHORUS 2 times)

3.
But I love to think of the picture fair,
That I saw as I turn'd away;
There my mother sat, and her silv'ry hair
Grew so bright in the sunbeam's play;
In the light her features a glory took
Like a crown on her placid brow,
All too bright for earth was that saintly look,
And she dwells with the angels now.

(CHORUS times)
