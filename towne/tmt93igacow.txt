1. I gave a cup of water
To one who was in need,
She took the gift I brought her,
As from a friend indeed.

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
Go, bring thy gifts to others,
To those in want and woe,
Why not be friends and brothers,
As on in life we go?

2. My heart was fill’d with glory
Inspired by one above;
It only prov’d the story;
I gave in Jesus’ love.

3. Go, sing in sweetest measure,
The songs you love the best;
’Twill give you holy pleasure,
’Twill sweeten joy and rest.
