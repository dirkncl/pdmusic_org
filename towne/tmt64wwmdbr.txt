1.
When will my darling boy return,
To cheer this sad and lonely heart;
And bid my spirit cease to yearn,
My sorrows quickly all depart.
Two years ago, he left my side
To fight for freedom, truth and right;
He is my precious one, my pride;
Oh! that he'd come to me tonight.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
When will my darling boy return,
To cheer this sad and lonely heart,
And bid my spirit cease to yearn,
My sorrows quickly all depart.

2.
In dreams amid the blinding storm
I see him wounded, dying, dead,--
I kneel to raise his form,
And wake to see that vision fled.
Again I meet him face to face,
Far from the sound of war's alarms,
And vainly strive with fond embrace,
To clasp a phantom in my arms.

3.
The changing seasons come and go,
The months have rounded into years;
Nor time nor chance can soothe my woe
My hopes are swallowed up in fears
When music's spell is o'er me thrown
I list not in the voice of song
Among the multitude, alone;
My spirit cries "How long, how long."

4.
Each battle lost, or victory won
O'erwhelms my heart with anguish wild,
Trembling I cry, my son! my son!
Oh! bring me tidings of my child
I feel I could not be resigned,
I could not hear the crushing pain,
If it should be my lot to find,
His name enrolled among the slain.
