1. ’Twas in the pleasant summertime, 
I met him all by chance; 
The robins sang their sweetest rhythm, 
And loving was his glance. 
We wandered ’mid the blooming flow’rs, 
He called me sweet and fair; 
The queen of all the sunny bow’rs, 
The brightest rosebud there! 

SPOKEN [1]. Oh! he was charming!— such a delightful 
little fellow! I never can forget.—

[CHORUS sung after each SPOKEN line]
When we met there by the river, 
In the sunlight’s merry glow 
For my heart he won forever, 
Where the pretty little water lilies grow!

2. He whispered words of fond delight,
The birds they listened, too,—
We wandered till the stars of night
Shone in the sky so blue.
Then, arm in arm, we wandered home,
Adown the leafy lane;
He said that he would never roam,
But meet me soon again.

SPOKEN [2]. Yes, he left me with the promise that 
he should never forget me! And I know he won’t. 
What a happy hour us past.—

3. I dream of him where’er I go,
I never can forget
Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow
The day when first we met!
The lilies all will fade and die,
The birds will fly away;
We can’t forget, nor he nor I,
The love was told that day!

SPOKEN [3]. No! For he begged me just to whisper 
the little “Yes”—
