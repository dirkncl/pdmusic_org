1. Voice of the mountain land, 
Still of my home you are telling! 
Come! with a message grand, 
Come! where your children are dwelling! 
Come! where your children are dwelling! 
Hope of the wand’rer still, 
Theme of his fondest emotion! 
Tell of each valley and hill. 
Far o’er the deepsounding ocean! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Wake to my heart once more, 
Dreams of each gallant band! 
Speak of the friends of yore, 
Voice of the mountain land! 
Speak of the friends of yore, 
Voice of the mountain land!

2. On like the eagle’s flight, 
On like the swift rolling river! 
Rise in your olden might, 
Breathing of Freedom forever! 
Breathing of Freedom forever! 
Give to the weary, rest, 
Hope to the lonely and sighing; 
Speed o’er the billow’s wild crest, 
Bring to me joy never-dying!
