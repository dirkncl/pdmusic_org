1. Oft in the twilight I’m dreaming, 
Dreaming the moments away, 
Watching the stars that are gleaming, 
Over the gates of the day, 
Voices of loved ones are calling, 
Far in the deep of the sky; 
Visions of beauty are falling, 
Hushed is my hearts weary sigh.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oft in the twilight I’m dreaming, 
Dreaming the moments away. 
Beautiful visions are teaming, 
Glories that bless’d not the day.

2. Oft  in the twilight I’m dreaming, 
Dreaming of joys that may be; 
Longing for eyes that are beaming, 
Patiently watching for me! 
Day, with its burdens and sadness, 
Dies in my dream of delight; 
Glimpses of glory and gladness, 
Wake to my wandering sight.
