1. I never know dear Woman’s pow’r, 
To soothe and charm the weary heart: 
Until a voice, remember’d well, 
In silver tones bade care depart. 
That touched the chords of life’s young joy, 
As tho’ Apollo woke the strain. 
But one sad thought still lingered there 
“Perhaps we ne’er shall meet a gain?” 
But one sad thought still lingers there 
“Perhaps we ne’er shall meet again.”

2. Though passing through the vale of life, 
My fond heart lingers with her yet 
And oft recalls those golden hours, 
Too bright to last, or e’er forget. 
’Twere bliss with thee whate’er betide 
For which I’d scorn the world’s domain, 
Nor would I live without the hope: 
That we once more may meet again. 
Nor would I live without the hope: 
That we once more may meet again.

3. O gentle dear, wheree’er thou art, 
For thee my fervent prayer ascend 
May sorrow ne’er thy brow o’ercast, 
And Fortune all her favors lend. 
I would not thou shouldst feel the void, 
That I have felt, or share my pain, 
Nor would I live without the hope: 
That we once more may meet again. 
Nor would I live without the hope: 
That we once more may meet again.
