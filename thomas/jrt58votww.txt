1. Voice of the western wind!
Thou singest from afar,
Rich with the music of a land
Where all my mem’ries are;
But in thy song I only hear
The echo, the echo of a tone
That fell divinely on my ear
In days forever gone,
In days forever, forever gone.

2. Star of the western sky!
Thou beamest from afar
With lustre caught from eyes I knew,
Whose orbs were each a star;
But oh, those rays, too wildly bright
No more, no more eclipse thine own,
And never shall I see the light
Of days forever gone,
Of days forever, forever gone.
