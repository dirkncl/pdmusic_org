1.
I wander'd alone in the leafy lane,
And slowly the hours flew by:
I look'd for him there, but I look'd in vain,
So what could I do but sigh?
So what could I do but sigh?

When, just as the shades of the ev'ning came,
And sadly I turn'd to go,
I heard a sweet voice and it spoke my name:
"A little bird told me so!"
I heard a sweet voice and it spoke my name:
"A little bird told me so!"

2.
He blush'd and he sigh'd as he wander'd near,
I knew that he came to woo;
He said there was none in the world so dear,
So what could a poor maid do?
So what could a poor maid do?

'Twas pleasanter far than to stray alone!
And all in the twilight glow,
He gave me his heart, and 'twas all my own--
"A little bird told me so!"
He gave me his heart and 'twas all my own--
"A Little bird told me so!"
