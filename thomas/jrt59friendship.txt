1. There is a flow'r that blooms at morn,
A broad and gaily-tinted flow'r,
But tho' its hues the day adorn,
It droops ere ev'ning's twilight hour;
And there's a Friendship soon begun
That shews as fair yet fades as soon.
It cannot bide the setting sun
Of adverse fortune's afternoon--
  Of adverse fortune's afternoon.

2. There is a flow'r, a tiny flow'r
That courteth not the public eye,
Yet hath a known perennial pow'r
To tell Love's immortality;
And there's a Friendship that can bide
The storms of winter's darkest day;
That proves whatever may betide,
Itself can never know decay--
  Itself can never know decay!
