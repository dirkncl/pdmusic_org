1. Comrades there are dear ones gathered
In our cottage home tonight,
Thinking of the absent soldier,
And I see their faces bright,
To these loved ones best and dearest,
Gently boys the story tell,
Breathe it softly, Oh! so softly,
How the soldier fought and fell.

2. There is one among those loved ones,
Dearer far than all the rest;
Tell her we shall meet in heaven,
In the mansions of the blest.
Breathe it softly to that Mother,
Who has prayed for me through all,
That I fought as soldiers should fight,
That I fell as heroes fall.

3. Tell my father, sister, brother,
That their absent one was slain,
'Neath the banner of his country,
On the gory battle plain.
On the gory battle plain.
Breathe it softly Oh, my Comrades,
With a brother's kindly breath,
That the flag in life above me,
Was my winding sheet in death.
