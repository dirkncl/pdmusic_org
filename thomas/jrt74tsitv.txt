1. Oh, stream in the valley, 
So lovely and bright! 
I wander beside thee 
With joy and delight! 
Thy soft rippling music 
Is sweet unto me; 
The scenes of my childhood 
Are mirrored in thee!       

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh, stream in the valley,
So lovely and bright! 
I wander beside thee 
With joy and delight!

2. I roam ’mid the lilies 
That gem thy green shore; 
And life is all beauty 
And brightness once more. 
Fair stream in the valley, 
Thy sweet song to me, 
Has called back the comrades 
I no more shall see!

3. She who was far dearer 
Than all earth beside, 
Once wandered in beauty 
Where thy waters glide! 
Then bear her my message, 
And tell her I long 
For days now departed 
When she heard thy song!
