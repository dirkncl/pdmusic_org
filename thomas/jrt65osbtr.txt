1. The stars of midnight on the flow’rs. 
Now pour their silver, silver rain. 
The cricket calls the fading hours 
In light in light and merry strain. 
The balmy zephyr bears above 
My parting sigh to thee, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
O! sweet be thy repose my dove, 
O! sweet be thy repose my dove, 
O! sweet be thy repose my dove, 
And be thy dreams of me. 
O! sweet be my repose my dove, 
And be thy dreams of me. 
Be thy dreams of me. 
Be thy dreams of me. 
Be thy dreams of me.

2. The tuneful whisper of the wave 
That creeps, that creeps along the shore. 
And flow’rs the gentle waters lave. 
Now tell now tell thy beauties o’er 
The language of their boundless love 
The stars breathe to the sea.
