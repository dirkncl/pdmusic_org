1. Though dark the road we travel o'er,--
No gleam around us falling,--
Each heart may find a glowing store
Of pleasure worth recalling,
  Of pleasure worth recalling.
Our eyes may rest on vales of gloom,
And hills in shade reclining;
But, lo! the mountain's clad in bloom!
Beyond, beyond, the sun is shining,
  Beyond, beyond, the sun is shining.

2. Thus when the heart is sad and lone,
And ev'ry joy hath left us,
Our eyes may see, tho' weary grown,
Each scene that hath bereft us,
  Each scene that hath bereft us.
Tho' round our feet is hopeless gloom,
Sad heart! no more repining!
The roses of thy life will bloom:
Beyond, beyond, the sun is shining,
  Beyond, beyond, the sun is shining.
