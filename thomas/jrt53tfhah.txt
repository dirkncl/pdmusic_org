1. When I left the dear home of my fathers,
And saw its blue hills melt away,
Young Hope chas'd the tears from mine eyelids,
Like the night-dew in morning's bright ray,
"Stay, stay" said the lov'd ones at parting,
"Oh! tempt not the wild Ocean foam,
It may be thou leav'st us forever,
Oh! stay with the fond hearts at home,
  It may be thou leav'st us forever,
  Oh! stay with the fond hearts at home."

2. But dreams of the future allured me,
Such dreams as young hearts only know,
When the skies are all sunshine and glory,
And this earth seems a heaven below;
And swiftly my bark bore me onward,
As gaily she dash'd through the foam,
Far far from the arms of my kindred,
The true hearts, the fond hearts at home;
  Far, far from the arms of my kindred,
  The true hearts, the fond hearts at home.

3. Like the beautiful tints of the evening,
My fancy's bright dream soon was o'er,
I returned to the home of my father's,
To the arms of my kindred once more;
"Stay, stay" said the loved ones at meeting,
Oh! say thou wilt never more roam;
"If there's bliss" I replied "in this wide world
Tis found with the fond hearts at home."
  "If there's bliss" I replied "in this wide world
  Tis found with the fond hearts at home."
