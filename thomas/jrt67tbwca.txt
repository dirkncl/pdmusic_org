1. Dead leaves were falling, lone birds were calling
Thro' sighing valleys, a gentle, and farewell;
Somebody straying, long was delaying;
Fond lips were meeting, but whose I'll never tell.
"Good-bye, my own love! for you alone, love,
My soul is pinning in sunlight and in rain,
Though we are parted, don't be sad-hearted;
Winter will pass, love, the birds will come again!
Winter will pass, love, the birds will come again!"

2. Sunlight and shadow fell on the meadow;
Dewdrops were gleaming; the skies were bringing May;
Soft winds were playing; somebody straying
Seeem'd very careless of beauties on the way!
"Once more, my darling, robin and starling
Sing down the valley forgetting all their pain.
Here by your side, love, now will I bide, love,
Sign not, for birds, love, will always come again!
Sign not, for birds, love, will always come again!"
