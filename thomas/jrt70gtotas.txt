Glorious things of thee are spoken, 
Zion, city of our God: 
He, whose word can not be broken, 
Form’d thee for His own abode; 
On the rock of ages founded, 
What can shake thy pure repose? 
With salvation’s walls surrounded, 
Then may’st smile at all thy foes. 

See the streams of living waters, 
Springing from eternal love, 
We’ll supply thy sons and daughters, 
And all fear of want remove; 
Who can faint while such a river, 
Ever flows their thirst t’assuage? 
Grace, which like the Lord, the giver, 
Never fails from age to age. 

Saviour, if of Zion’s city, 
I through grace a member am, 
Let the world deride or pity, 
I will glorify thy name; 
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure, 
All his boasted pomp and show; 
Solid joys and lasting treasure, 
None but Zion’s children know.
