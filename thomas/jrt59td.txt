[SATB] 
We praise thee, 
We praise thee, 
We praise thee, O God, 
We praise thee O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. 
All the earth doth worship thee, the Father everlasting.
[BASS]
To thee all angels cry aloud. 
[SATB]
The Heav’ns and all the pow’rs therein. 
[SA]
To Thee Cherubim and Seraphim continually do cry, 
[SAT]
Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Lord God of Saba-oth; 
Heav’n and earth are full, are full, full of the Majesty of thy Glory. 
[TB]
The glorious company of the Apostles praise thee. 
[SA]
The goodly fellowship of the Prophets 
[SATB]
praise thee. 
[SAT]
The noble army of Martyrs 
[SATB]
praise thee. 
The holy Church thro’out all the world doth acknowledge thee; 
The Father of an infinite Majesty; 
Thine adorable, true, and only Son; 
Also the Holy Ghost the Comforter. 
Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ. 
Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father. 
[S]
When thou lookest upon Thee to deliver man, 
thou didst humble thyself to be born of a Virgin. 
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, 
thou didst open the Kingdom of Heav’n to all believers. 
[SATB]
Thou sittest at the right hand of God in the Glory of the Father. 
[A]
We believe that thou shalt come to be our Judge. 
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants, 
whom thou hast redeem’d with thy precious blood. 
[SA]
Make them to be number’d with thy saints, in Glory everlasting. 
[SATB]
O Lord, save thy people, and bless thine heritage. 
Govern them, and lift them up for ever. 
Day by day we magnify thee 
And we worship Thy name ever, world without end. 
[B]
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin. 
O Lord have mercy, have mercy upon us. 
O Lord, let the mercy be upon us, as our trust is in thee.
[SATB]
O Lord, in thee, in thee have I trushed; 
Let me never be confounded.
