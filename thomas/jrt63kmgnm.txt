1.
How dear to each heart are childhood's gay hours,
Their bright sunny skies and evergreen bow'rs,
Ere the dark veil was drawn that hid our view
Furturity's pictures so varied and true;
When the sun had gone down, being tired of play,
We watch'd the dim shadows at twilight so grey,
Our hearts full of love, each said with delight:

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.
Kiss me good night, mother, kiss me good night.

2.
How often those words 'mid the danger and strife,
From the day dawn of love 'till the sunset of life,
So plaintive and mild, as if dropp'd from above,
Fall on the heart like an echo of love!
Ah! mother, alas! in vain do I mourn,
Those halcyon days of peace to return,
To be but a child again happy and bright,
