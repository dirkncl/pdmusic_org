1.
There's a land, a radiant land,
That the spirit often seeks,
Upon whose sudden strand
The wave of fancy breaks,
  The wave of fancy breaks;
There the skies are ever fair,
And the sunlight ever beams,
And the flow'rs are bright and rare,
In that land, the land of dreams,
  And the flow'rs are bright and rare,
  In that land, the land of dreams.

2.
In that land, that radiant land,
In many a dwelling place,
Whose beauty human hand
Could never never trace,
  Could never never trace;
There joyous songs are heard
In the vales of crystal streams,
From breeze and voice, and bird,
In that land, the land of dreams,
  From breeze and voice, and bird,
  In that land, the land of dreams.

3.
To that land, that radiant land,
Whose spirit hath not sail'd
To seek the golden strand,
When the joy of earth life failed,
  When the joy of earth life failed;
In thought's brave barque alone,
To the realm of changeless beams,
For the radiance only known,
In that land, the land of dreams,
  For the radiance only known,
  In that land, the land of dreams.
