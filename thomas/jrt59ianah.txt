1.
I ask not a home in the mansion of pride
Where marble shines out in the pillars and walls
Though the roof be of gold it is brilliantly cold
And joy may not dwell in its torchlighted halls.
But seek for a bosom all honest and true
Where love once awaken'd will never depart
Turn, turn to that breast like the dove to its rest
And you'll find there's no home like a home in the heart,
You'll find there's no home like a home in the heart.

2.
Oh link but one spirit that's warmly sincere
That will heighten your pleasure and solace your care
Find a soul you may trust as the kind and the just
And be sure the wide world holds no treasure so rare.
Then the plains of misfortune may shadow our lot
The cheek-searing teardrops of sorrow may start
But a star never dim sheds a halo for him
Who can turn for repose to a home in the heart,
Who can turn for repose to a home in the heart.
