1.
O! the summer morn is brightly glowing,
The wild birds wake their song;
And the streamlet, as it softly murmurs,
So gently glides along.

CHORUS 1
Where the sweet hedgerose is blowing
In the woodlands' green;
There I love to wander
With my heart's true Queen,
My bonny, bonny Jean!

2.
Yet, 'tis not the rose tint of summer,
Not the song-birds' joyous lay,
Nor the streamlet's soft and murmuring music,
That makes my heart feel gay.

CHORUS 2
'Tis her smile that beams upon me,
'Mid each flow'ry scene;
While I fondly wander
With my heart's new Queen,
My bonny, bonny Jean!

3.
"Bonny Jean," your smiles are always with me,
When absent, love, from thee,
Making joy and sunshine round my pathway
Where ever I may be.

CHORUS 3
May they ever beam upon me,
In this merry scene;
While I fondly wander
With my heart's new Queen,
My bonny, bonny Jean!
