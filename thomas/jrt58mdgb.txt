1. 
My mother dear, to day we part; 
  Today we say fare well, 
And these brief moments as they fly, 
  Sad tones of parting tell; 
These old familiar scenes no more, 
  My feet shall linger nigh; 
But Love shall keep their mem’ry warm, 
  My mother, dear, good bye! 


[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Mother dear, Mother dear, 
Mother, Mother, 
Mother dear, good bye!

2. 
I go to do the deeds of life, 
  To battle for renown; 
To strive on valor’s conflict field, 
  For Fortune’s starry crown; 
But never, wheresoe’er I roam,
  ’Neath cloud or sunny sky, 
Shall I forget the lov’d at home,
  My mother, dear, good bye! 


3. 
Thy counsels I will ever hold,
  As treasures in my heart;
I take them as thy holiest gift,
  On this the day we part;
We part! but meet again, so hush
  Each sad regret and sigh;
I will return with joy to thee,
  My mother, dear, good bye!
