1. O! the fairies have not all departed
And bid this dull planet adieu,
For I know a maid gentle hearted,
With eyes that are tender and blue,
You’d take in a moment to be one,
She weaves in all bosoms a spell,
So if you are longing to see one,—
It’s Jenny who lives in the dell,
Jenny who lives in the dell.
Jenny who lives in the dell.
So if you are longing to see one,
It’s Jenny who lives in the dell.

CHORUS [sung after each verse (may by sung or omitted)])
Jenny who lives in the dell,
Jenny who lives in the dell.
There’s no maid so bright and so bonny!
As Jenny who lives in the dell.

2. O! I’m sighing wherever I wander,
My heart has been stolen away,
On nothing at all do I ponder,
But Jenny’s fair face all the day;
But she sings as blithesome as ever,
And knows that I love her so well,
For Love in his roving has never
Found Jenny who lives in the dell,
Jenny who lives in the dell.
Jenny who lives in the dell,
For Love, in his roving, has never
Found Jenny who lives in the dell.
