1. Bird of the angel wing,
Beautiful bird!
Where is thy dwelling place?
Where wert thou reared?
Whence comes thy raptured song,
Like magic spell?
Bird of the angel wing,
Tell me, pray tell.

QUARTET [sung after each verse]
Vain are my pleadings then,
Thou wilt not stay;
But thou'lt return again
Some fairer day;
Till then I'll wait for thee,
Faithful and true;
Bird of the angel wing,
Adieu, adieu!

2. Souring to giddy height,
Far from thy home,
Over the mountain-top,
Where dost thou roam?
Free as the air above,
Bright as the sun,
Bird of the angel wing,
Beautiful one!

3. Bird of the angel wing,
Linger awhile,
Sing thy sweet song for me,
Care to beguile;
Shelter I'll give to thee,
Food and a home,
If thou'lt remain with me,
And never roam.

4. Come to me yet again,
Far from the bee,
And with thy sweetest song
Sing unto me;
After the snow is gone,
And winter's done,
Come thou and sing for me,
Beautiful one!
