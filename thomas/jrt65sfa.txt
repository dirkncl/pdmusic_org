1. Smiles for all! smiles for all! 
The world withour is sad. 
While they fall, while they fall, 
The mourning heart is glad. 
Rich and poor, high and low 
Will feel the joys they give; 
While we go, each may sow 
The flow’rs that ever live.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Smiles for all! smiles for all! 
The world with-out is sad 
While they fall, while they fall, 
The mourn-ing heart is glad.

2. Hopes will fade! hopes will fade! 
And why should we repine? 
Light and shade, light and shade, 
In crazy life coinbine. 
Time may bring fears and gloom, 
And flow’rs we love depart. 
Smiles will bloom ’round their tomb, 
The roses of the heart.
