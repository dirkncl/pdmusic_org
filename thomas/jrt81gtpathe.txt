1. Kind friends, if you listen, a Song I will sing,— 
The subject I know is not new, 
Yes a few simple facts to notice I’ll bring: 
I find from experience true. 
“I pity the poor man!” the rich often say, 
“His heart in its trials must burn! 
But how csn we help him? ’Tis easy if they 
Give the poor all they honestly earn.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, yes! there is plenty for all who exist, 
We should keep each other in turn; 
If they who are worthy you wish to assist, 
Give the poor all they honestly earn!

2. We all know a dollar a day is too small! 
Tho’ many now labor for less; 
’Tis hard, but essential to meet ev’ry call 
Of little ones home in distress; 
If the rich were but lib’ral the poor could live, 
And joy in their homes would return, 
If they who have millions remember and give, 
Give the poor all they honestly earn.

3. Oh! give the poor men better wages I pray, 
For, they on their earnings depend, 
And, many a life you will save in this way, 
That to prison might otherwise end! 
If they ask a favor don’t push them aside,— 
Perhaps it may yet be your turn! 
While you’ve thousands to spare, your purse open wide: 
Give the poor all they honestly earn.
