"The Box of Shamrocks" (1859)
Words by John Brougham, Esqr.
To whom the music is
Cordially dedicated by the 
COMPOSER
John Rogers Thomas, 1830-1896

At the departure of one of the Galway Steamers from Ireland a 
touching incident occured:-- A poor old woman was observed to 
get on board, having no luggage whatever except a box filled 
with shamrocks; upon being interogated, she said that her son 
in America, who after many years of industry had at last 
obtained a home, had sent for her but was only able to remit 
the mere passage money.
"He told me," she continued, "to bring some remembrance with 
me of his birth-place; and shure this is all I had to take! 
Maybe he'll be plazed to see it."

1. My aged heat long dead to joy,
Now throbs with new delight;
Once more I'll see my noble boy,
So precious to my sight;
May God protect my noble son,
Well has he toil'd for me--
I'm going to the home he won,
His home across the sea!

2. He bids me some remembrance bring
From his lov'd place of birth--
Alas! I have no richer thing;
Than this poor box of earth;
But don't I know that when he hears
I've borne it on my knee,
And kept it green with happy tears,
Sure it must welcome be!

3. I've brought it from the very spot,
Where but a child he play'd,
While faintly o'er his darksome lot,
A transient sunbeam stray'd;
Oh! may its influence restore
Again those days of glee,
And fill with brightness evermore,
His home beyond the sea.
