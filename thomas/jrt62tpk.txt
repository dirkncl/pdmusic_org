1. The parting kiss my lips she gave, 
Yet lingers there in odors sweet; 
No other lips to mine shall press, 
Tho’ ne’er again our lips shall meet. 
Enraptur’d still, my bosom thrills 
With that dear pledge of purest love, 
Her kind and gentle heart bestow’; 
’Twas bliss all other bliss above— 
’Twas bliss all other bliss a bove.

2. On my fond breast her head reclin’d, 
Our mutual troth we plighted then, 
True faith eternal, each to each, 
We vow’d and kiss’d and vow’d again. 
The parting kiss my lips she gave, 
Yet lingers there in odors sweet; 
No other lips to mine shall press 
Tho’ ne’er again our lips shall meet— 
Tho’ ne’er again our lips shall meet.
