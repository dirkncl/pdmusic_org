1.
Beautiful Isle of the sea!
Smile on the brow of the waters!
Dear are your mem'ries to me;
Sweet as the songs of your daughters,
Over your mountains and vales,
Down by each murmuring river,
Cheer'd by the flow'r-loving gales.
O could I wander for ever!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Land of the Free and the Old,
Home ever dear unto me,
Fountain of pleasures untold,
Beautiful Isle of the sea!
  Fountain of pleasures untold,
  Beautiful Isle of the sea!

2.
Oft on your shell-girdled shore,
Ev'ning has found me reclining,
Visions of youth dreaming o'er,
Down where the lighthouse was shining,
Far from the gladness you gave,
Far from all joys worth possessing,
Still o'er the lose weary wave.
Comes in the wand'rer your blessing.
