1.
Yes, I will meet the tonight,
Down by the home of the roses,
After the sun takes its flight,
When the sweet songbird reposes.
Down by the old rustic gate,
Where we have met often times,
For thy sure coming I'll wait,
When the old willage bell chimes.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Yes, I will meet thee tonight,
Down by the home of the roses,
After the sun takes its flight,
And the sweet songbird reposes, reposes.

2.
Naught but the whispering breeze
Lists to the tale love confesses,
Starlights that peep thro' the trees,
Tell us how constancy blesses.
Thou we shall sometime grow old,
Time shall our sweet vows renew,
Marking this bright hour with gold,
If we are loving and true.
