1. Liberty! Liberty! Liberty or Death! 
The land awakens at the shout 
Fling on our flag the watchword out! 
Give to the battle bugle breath, 
And welcome Liberty or Death! 
Liberty or Death! 
With that watchword waving o’er us, 
Where’s the foe can stand before us? 
Liberty or Death, Liberty or Death, 
Liberty or Death! 

2. Liberty, Liberty, Liberty or Death! 
From the sources of the founts, 
Forests, vallies, plains and mounts, 
From the east, west, south and north 
A mighty host comes rushing forth! 
Liberty or Death! 
With that standard strreaming o’er us, 
Where’s the foe but flies before us? 
Liberty or Death, Liberty or Death, 
Liberty or Death!
