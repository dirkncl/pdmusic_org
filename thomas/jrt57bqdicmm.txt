1. As Kate was sitting in a wood,
Beneath an oak tree's leafy cover,
Musing in pleasant solitude--
Who should come by, by John, her lover!
He press'd her hand, he kiss'd her cheek,
Then warmer glowing kiss'd the other,
While she exclaim'd and strove to shriek:
Be quiet do, I'll call my mother!
Be quiet do, I'll call my mother!

2. He say her anger was sincere,
And lovingly began to chide her,
Then wiping from her cheek the tear,
He sat him on the grass beside her;
He feign'd such pretty am'rous woe,
Breath'd such sweet vows one after t'other,
She could but smile and whisper'd love,
Be quiet do, I'll call my mother!
Be quiet do, I'll call my mother!

3.
He talk'd so long and talk's so well,
And vow'd he meant not to deceive her,
Kate felt more grief than she would tell
When with a sigh he rose to leave her;
"Oh! John" said she, and must you go,
I love you better than all other,
There is no use to hurry so;
I never meant to call my mother!
I never meant to call my mother!
