1. Our own dear Land, our native Land, 
Home of the brave and free 
In vain we search old acean’s strain 
To find a land like thee: 
Thy Towering hills, thy Prairies wide, 
Thy forests old and dim 
Thy streams that roll in matchless pride 
Thy torrents thunder hymn 
Our own dear Land our native Land 
None can compare with thee 
The fairest work of nature’s hand 
Our own dear Land for me!

2. Our own dear Land, our native Land, 
Fearless thy banner waves 
And nations yet unborn shall stand 
Beside thy heroes’ graves.
Our fathers spurn’d oppression’s laws 
And fought for God and right 
So may their sons in freedom’s cause 
Be foremost in the fight! 
Our own dear Land, our native Land 
Home of the brave and free 
The fairest work of nature’s hand 
Our own dear Land for me!
