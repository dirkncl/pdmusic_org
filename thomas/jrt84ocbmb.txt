1. O, come, buy my blossoms! The rarest of Earth! 
For the grave, for the bridal or day of one’s birth. 
I have Buttercups, Daisies and Violets wild, 
And sweet Pansies as bright as the eye of a child.

QUARTETTE [sung after each verse]
O come, buy me blossoms, the right thing for you, 
Is a sweet blended nosegay of red, white and blue. 
O come, buy my blossoms the right thing for you, 
Is a sweet blended nosegay of red, white and blue. 

2. O, come, buy my blossoms! Pray what shall they be? 
I have blooms of all nations from over the sea; 
And for Britons, save exiles from Dublin or Cork, 
The Red Rose of Lancaster or White Rose of York.

3. O, come, buy my blossoms! All fragrant and fair! 
Buy a brilliant bouquet or a neat bontonniere. 
Gallant Frenchmen, I see what you’d like at a glance, 
Buy the beautiful, radiant Lily of France.

4. O, come, buy my blossoms! As sweet as can be! 
They are culled from the prairies or down by the sea; 
They are pluck’d from the moors where sweet thistles abound, 
Or they bloom on the green where the Shamrock is found.
