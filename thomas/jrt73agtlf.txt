1. Angels, guide the little feet,
Starting on life's weary way;
Smooth each trouble they may meet,--
Watch them, lest they go astray!
Toilsome is the road and long;
Stronger hearts than yours despond.
Angels cheer them with your song;
Tell them of the goal beyond.

2. Angels, guide the little feet,
In the path and up the hill;
Wash them in the waters sweet;
Turn aside each coming ill,
Guide them safely all the way;
Ever near whate'er betide,
Through the night and thro' the day,
'Till they reach the Savior's side.
