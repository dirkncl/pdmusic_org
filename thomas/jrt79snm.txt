1. Strangers no more forever, 
Still we as friends shall meet; 
Give back thy heart’s affection— 
Trustful and true and sweet. 
What is the summer’s glory, 
Far from thy loving sight? 
Now in my heart for ever 
Reigneth supreme delight! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Strangers no more forever, 
Each bitter word forgot; 
Gaze in mine eyes so fondly, 
Dearest, O doubt me not! 

2. Strangers no more forever, 
Each loving vow renew! 
Welcom’d, as summer roses. 
Welcome the diamond dew. 
Life, that was sad and lonely, 
Now is one blissful dream; 
Sunlight and joy forever 
Here in my heart shall beam.
