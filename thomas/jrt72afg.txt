1. A friendly hand to clasp to mine,
O give me when my joy has fled!
A face whose beaming smiles will shine
For me as flow'rs above the dead;
A voice to fondly speak my praise
When loudly other lips condemn;
O give me these and all my days
Will bear for me a fadeless gem!
  O give me these and all my days
  Will bear for me a fadeless gem!

2. A heart my faults will gently scan,
And nobly bear for me through all
The love which fairer days began,
And see the last whate'er befal;
The cheerful eyes that met my own
As brightly as they met before,
When 'round me winds of sorrow moan,
O give me these, I ask no more.
  When 'round me winds of sorrow moan,
  O give me these, I ask no more.
