1. Farewell ye faded flowers,
Bright darlings of the spring;
Delights of happy hours,
When woods with rapture ring;
All bathed in dewy tears,
Around my way ye lie,
Like hopes of other years,
Ye bloomed alas to die;
  Like hopes of other years,
  Ye bloomed alas to die.
Farewell! Farewell.

QUARTETT ad lib.
All bathed in dewy tears,
Around my way ye lie,
Like hopes of other years,
Ye bloomed alas to die;
  Like hopes of other years,
  Ye bloomed alas to die.
Farewell! Farewell.

2. So fade the loving hearts,
That wander by our side;
So ev'ry joy departs,
While sadly here we hide;
In ev'ry breeze that sighs,
O'er meadow and o'er dell,
From dark and chilling skies,
I hear your long farewell,
  From dark and chilling skies,
  I hear your long farewell.
Farewell! Farewell.

QUARTETTE ad lib.
In ev'ry breeze that sighs,
O'er meadow and o'er dell,
From dark and chilling skies,
I hear your long farewell,
  From dark and chilling skies,
  I hear your long farewell.
Farewell! Farewell.

3. But Life's eternal Spring,
Shall bloom tho' hearts decay;
To Faith we fondly cling,
While here we darkly stray;
O! bliss beyond the grave,
O! land so fair and sweet,
Our Saviour's love shall save,
Where lips no more repeat--
  Our Saviour's love shall save,
  Where lips no more repeat.
Farewell! Farewell.

QUARTETTE ad lib.
O! bliss beyond the grave,
O! land so fair and sweet,
Our Saviour's love shall save,
Where lips no more repeat--
  Our Saviour's love shall save,
  Where lips no more repeat.
Farewell! Farewell.
