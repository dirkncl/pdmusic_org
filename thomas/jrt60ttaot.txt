1. I know that thou art mine, my love, 
I know that thou art fair, 
And lovelier than the orange flow’rs 
Which bind thy glossy hair; 
That thou hast ev’ry gentle grace 
Which nature can design— 
I know that thou art mine, my love, 
I know that I am thine! 
I know that thou art mine, my love, 
I know that I am thine! 
Yes, thine my love, yes, thine my love, 
Thine, thine, and only thine! 

2. I know that thou art true, my love, 
And welcome as the breeze 
Which comes, with healing in its wings, 
Across the summer seas; 
That thou hast ev’ry winning charm, 
That renders love divine— 
I know that thou art mine, my love, 
I know that I am thine! 
I know that thou art mine, my love, 
I know that I am thine! 
Yes, thine my love, yes, thine my love, 
Thine, thine, and only thine!
