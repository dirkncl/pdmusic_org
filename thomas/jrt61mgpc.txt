*This piece may be sung as a Solo up to the asterisk (*)
taking up the Chorus from that point.

1.
May God protect Columbia,
And she still may be
The hallow'd home of Liberty,
The glory of the free!
Still faithful to the heritage
Our fathers left of yore;
A shining light to all the world,
Both now and ever more.

*CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then long live dear Columbia,
And may she ever be,
The hallow'd home of Liberty,
The glory of the free!

2.
May God protect Columbia,
Thro'out here wide domain
From East to West, from North to South,
May peace and plenty reign;
May justice, truth and happiness
Estend o'er all the Land,
And universal brotherhood
Unite each heart and hand.

3.
May God protect Columbia,
When foes her peace assail
And guide the glorious ship
Triumphant thro' the gale!
And so our Country's Flag shall wave
Resplendent as of yore.
The emblem of true Liberty
From shore to farthed shore.
