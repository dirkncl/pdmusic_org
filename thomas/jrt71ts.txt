1. Dimly the shadows 
Fold leaf and tree, 
Sweet dreams are waking, 
Lone heart to thee, 
Lone heart to thee! 
Day’s weary burden 
Fall from thee now, 
Sorrow and anguish 
Cloud not thy brow, 
Shadows of twilight 
Fold leaf and tree, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Sweet dreams are waking, 
Lone heart to thee, 
Sweet dreams are waking, 
Lone heart to thee.

2. Care’s weary voicees 
Die with  the day, 
Hopes bloom around us, 
Ah! could they stay! 
Ah! could they stay! 
No tints of glory 
Burn in the West, 
Yet eve’ning brings thee 
Blessings and rest; 
So while the shadows 
Fold leaf and tree, 

3. Love that has faded, 
Joys that have flown, 
Still come, but leave thee 
all, all alone, 
All, all alone. 
Lo, falls the twilight, 
When life shall wane, 
Bringing thee glories 
Now sought in vain, 
Yes! while the shadows 
Fold leaf and tree,
