1. Beautiful flow'rs! sparkling with dew,
Perfume zephyrs carolling by;
Bare your gay heards, naught fairer than you
Blossoms so richly under the sky,
Dance in the shade of the sloping dell,
Hasten the sweets that the honeybees sip;
Scatter you odours raising a spell,
Like nectar cull'd from a maiden's lip.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Beautiful flow'rs sparkling with dew,
Perfum the zephyrs carolling by;
Bare your gay heards, naught fairer than you
Blossoms so richly under the sky.

2. Beautiful flow'rs your petals rare,
Revel in treasures the richest crave!
Beautiful flow'rs the weeping fair
Thinks ye when strewing her lover's grave
Coy with the locks that so wantonly play
O'er swelling bosoms purer than snow;
Circle the frolicsome fairies gay
Where still your violet sister's grow.
