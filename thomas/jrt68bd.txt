1. An old man sat by a cottage door; 
Weary he was, and faint, and poor, 
And far had he walk’d that Summer day, 
With no kind voice to cheer his way, 
Thinking,— thinking thoughts of the past, 
Of the happy time that fled so fast, 
And looking fondly, with misty gaze, 
Back to the beautiful Better Days!
 
2. From the vinewreath’d door two children came, 
In pitying hearts and eyes the same, 
And food they brought for the poor man’s need, 
And gentle words, that were food indeed! 
“Once I, had children, too, like these, 
My Boy lies deep ’neath  the rocking seas; 
My Girl, I know  not where she strays, 
And so fell the night on my Better Days! 

3. A sudden cry on his sad thoughts broke, 
One word, one thrilling tone it spoke: 
’Twas “Father!”— ’twas his sailor son, 
The lost, the wept, recover’d one! 
Now rest, old man, no more to roam, 
The vine-wreath’d door says “Welcome, welcome home!” 
Thy daughter walk’d in virtue’s ways: 
Thou’ll meet her in God’s Better Days!
