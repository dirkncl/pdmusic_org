1. I have seen thee in my dreaming, 
I have thought of thee by day; 
And an eye on me is beaming, 
In the distance far away, 
in the distance for away. 
The cloud that floats above me, 
Takes the likeness of thy form, 
Oh! say, dost thou still love me, 
In a realm that knows not storm, 
in a realm that knows not storm [...]

2. Where the crystal streams are rolling 
Thro’ amaranthine bow’rs 
Unheard the deathbell tolling 
As in this world of ours, 
as in this world of ours 
Where the form divinely moulded, 
Is never laid to rest, 
With the pale hands meekly folded 
On the frozen puiseless breast, 
On the frozen pulseless breast.

3. O say dost thou remember 
When first I call’d thee mine, 
Or quench’d is love’s bright ember 
In the home that now is thine, 
in the home that now is thine. 
The cloud that floats above me, 
Takes the likeness of thy form; 
Oh! say dost thou still love me, 
In a realm that knows not storm, 
In a realm that knows not storm?
