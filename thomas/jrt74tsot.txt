1. Oh sing again! that song of thine 
Hath wakened mem’ries old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though from mine eye there falls a tear. 
Each word and tone recalls the time  
When I, in childhood’s ignorance, 
Dream’d life was bliss alas, its cares 
Soon rudely broke that glowing trance! 

[REFRAIN sing after each verse]
Oh sing again! that song of thine 
Hath wakened mem’ies old and dear, 
And bringeth joy unto my heart, 
Though from mine eye there falls a tear.

2. Oh sing again! that gentle strain 
Has charm’d my weary heart from woe, 
The present fades, the past is mine, 
With all the joys of long ago. 
The tones of friends delight my ear, 
And loving arms are round me press’d 
With musical accord again 
Sweet hopes and joy thrill o’er my breast.

3. Oh sing again! and let me hear 
The strains I loved in days of yore; 
Thy voice seems like an echo sweet 
Of tones I’ll hear on earth no more. 
O sing! and should I weep the while, 
My tears will not from sorrow flow, 
For oh, thy strains with mem’ries teem 
Of friends and joys of long ago.
