1. 
Murmurings ever, thou beautiful shell, 
Sweet is thy music to me. 
Tell me of happier regions, oh! tell, 
Under the waves of the sea; 
Is there no refuge from cares that op­press, 
No heart to welcome, with love’s sweet caress,— 
Realm of more joy and where sorrow is less, 
Down in the fathomless sea, 
Under the waves of the sea! 

2. 
Dawn in the grottoes of coral and pearl 
Is there no haven of rest? 
Far from the tumult of earth’s busy whirl 
Dwelling with those we love best; 
Is there no day without shadow of pain, 
No broken link in affection’s sweet chain, 
No note dis­cordant in life’s fleeting strain, 
Down in the fathomless sea, 
Under the waves of the sea!
