1. Loves early dream has music
In the tale it loves to tell
Loves early dream has roses
Where it delights to dwell
It has beauty in its landscape
And verdure in its trees,
Unshadowed by a passing cloud
Unruffled by a breeze
  It has beauty in its landscape
  And verdure in its trees,
  Unshadowed by a passing cloud
  Unruffled by a breeze

2. Loves early dream has moonlight
Upon its crystal lake
Where stormy tempest never blows
Her angry billows break
It has splendour in its sunshine
And freshness in its dew
And all its scenes of happiness
Are beautiful and true
  It has splendour in its sunshine
  And freshness in its dew
  And all its scenes of happiness
  Are beautiful and true.
