1. Oh! the past has many treasures,
And from out its hidden mine
Oft will bring all early pleasures
On our gloomy years to shine.
When the quiet ev'ning closes
Weary sorrows cease to flow;
And we dream amid the roses
In the moonlight, long ago.
And we dream amid the roses
In the moonlight long ago,
In the moonlight long ago.


2. One by one, the joys around us
Perish with each fading hour
But the love that early bound us
Blooms a never drooping flow’r.
Hands on loving that caress’d us
Smile as fair as moonlight’s glow,
Bless us now, as oft they bless’s us
In the moonlight long ago;
Bless us now, as oft they bless’s us
In the moonlight long ago,
In the moonlight long ago.
