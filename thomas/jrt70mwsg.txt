1. Lay your hand in mine, my darling, 
Fast the moments fly! 
O, the pain to love you dearly, 
Then to say “good bye!” 
Still my heart would fondly linger;— 
Closer to my side! 
Far away my path must wander, 
O’er the water wide! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Lay your hand in mine, my darling, 
Fast the moments fly! 
O! the pain to love you dearly! 
Must we say “good bye!”

2. O, the sad, the weary parting! 
Dark the hour has grown, 
Hearts that once have loved, my dearest, 
Ne’er can be alone! 
Sweet the hopeful words you whisper, 
How they cheer my pain; 
Tho’ in sadness we are parted, 
Soon we’ll meet again.
