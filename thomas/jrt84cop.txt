[SATB]
Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us,
is sacrificed for us, is sacrificed for us,
Therefore let us keep the feast,
not with the old leav'n,
neither with the leav'n of malace and wickedness;
but with th'unleav'ned bread of sincerity and truth.

SOLO. Bass.
Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more;
Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more;
death hath no dominion over him,
death hath no dominion over him.

[SATB]
For in that he died he died unto sin once,
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

DUETT. Sop. & Alto.
Likewise reackon ye also yourselves to be dead
To be dead indeed unto Sin,
but alive unto God thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.

[SATB]
Christ is risen from the dead,
Christ is risen from the dead
and become the first fruits of them that slept.

SOLO. Tenor.
For since by man came death,
by man came also the recurrection of the dead.

[SATB]
By man came also the resurrection of the dead.

SOLO. [Tenor.]
For as in Adam all die.

[SATB]
Even so in Christ shall all, shall all be made alive,
Even so in Christ shall all, shall all be made alive,
even so in Christ shall all, shall all be made alive,
even so in Christ shall all, shall all be made alive,

GLORIA. [SATB]
Glory be to the Father
and to the Son
and to the Holy Ghost
as it was in the beginning,
is now and ever shall be
world without end 
Amen, Amen, Amen!
