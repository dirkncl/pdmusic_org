1. Must I then leave thee? 
O, sad words, farewell! 
More pain to grieve thee, 
Thou heart, love may tell! 
Years may divide us, 
Yet why, love, repine? 
Fate may deride us, 
But still thou art mine, 
Fate may divide us, 
But still thou art mine!

CHORUS 1
Years may divide us 
Yet why, love repine? 
Fate may deride us, 
But still thou art mine.

2. Doubts may beset thee? 
And sad tears may flow, 
Could I forget thee? 
Ah, no, dearest, no! 
Why must we never? 
Yet one thought is sweet, 
Love lasts forever, 
And still we shall meet, 
Love lasts forever, 
And still we shall meet!

CHORUS 2
Why must we nev er? 
Yet one thought is sweet; 
Love lasts forever, 
And still we shall meet!
