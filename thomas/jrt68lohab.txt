1.
Land of home and beauty,
Ev'ry though of thee
Wakes within my bosom
Sweetest melody.
All the hopes I cherish
Twine around thee now,
Fondly as the ivy
Binds the oaken bough.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Dearer, Oh! still dearer
While afar I rove!
Land of home and beauty,
Land of joy and love!

2.
Other skies are glowing,
Other flow'rs are fair;
Those dreams of home are dearer,
For my heart is there!
Olden mem'ries cluster
Round each lovely scene,
As about thy mountains
Cluster mosses green.

3.
Oft my fancy wanders
By thy purling streams,
Oft I see thy meadows,
In my midnight dreams.
O, could I but linger,
As in days of yore,
On thy mighty mountains,
On thy pebbly shore.
