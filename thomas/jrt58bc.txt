1. Beautiful cloud, in purest ether sleeping,
Why should we sigh for a summer day?
But these tears of heav'n that thou art weeping,
Should we have flowers to beautify our way?
Earth far beneath, the fadeless blue above thee,
Thron'd 'mid the stars, still lowly was thy birth;
Not for thy beauty only do we love thee,
Giver or blessings to the grateful earth.
Beautiful cloud!
Beautiful, beautiful cloud!

2. Beautiful cloud, all lovely shapes assuming,
In thy embrace the whitewing'd angels sleep,
Why else the silv'ry light thy form illuming?
Sure there their watch our guardian angels keep:
Thine is the land from mortal vision shrouded,
Thou, lovely dream, the cloud-wall of the skies,
Veilest above the million spirits crowded
Round the bright throne thou hid'st from human eyes.
Beautiful cloud!
Beautiful, beautiful cloud!
