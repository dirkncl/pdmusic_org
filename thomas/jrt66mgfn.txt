1. What are you good for, my brave little man! 
Answer that question for me, if you can. 
You, with your fingers as white as a nun, 
You with your ringlets as bright as the sun. 
All the day long with your busy contriving, 
Into all mischief and fun you are driving; 
See if your wise little noddle can tell 
What you are good for, now? ponder it well.

2. Over the carpet, the dear little feet, 
Came with a putter to climb on my seat; 
Two merry eyes, full of frolic and glee. 
Under their lashes look’d up unto me; 
Two little hands, pressing soft on my face 
Dear me down close in a loving em brace; 
Two rosy lips gave the answer so true, 
“Good to love you, momma; good to love you?”
