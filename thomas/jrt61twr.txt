1. Let others boast of flowers rare— 
I love the wild, the wild rose best, 
Her buds have nestled in thy hair, 
And trembled on thy breast; 
’Mid blossom’s gay, whose anthers fling 
Their spray in golden, golden streaks, 
My wild rose wears her wedding ring 
While blushes dye her cheeks! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Let others boast of flowers rave, 
I love my wild, my wild rose best, 
Long may her blossoms deck thy hair 
And tremble on thy breast.

2. My sweet red rose, long may you reign, 
Far from the crowded town; 
Fair mistress of thy wild domain, 
Queen of the damask crown! 
Bright youth must fade, and roses die, 
As onward, onward roll the years,— 
But mem’ry fond, will linger by 
Love’s blushing souvenirs!
