1. Her eye is like the mignonette
In morning’s silver dew,
And deepens into violet,
When night o’ercasts its blue.
A hyacinthine liquid gem,
Without a speck or flaw;
A diamond in love’s diadem,
The eye of Annie Law.

2. The sunshine falls upon her face,
As rosy as the dawn,
And evry movement hears the grace
Of forest nymph or fawn.
Her forehead’s fair as winter’s snow,
Or blanch’d and bloomy haw;
And redder than its berries glow,
The eyes of Annie Law.

3. Oh! were she but a shepherdess,
Then I would tend her flocks,
And with the purple pansies dress,
Her long and sunny locks.
My days would be so pleasant,
Though my roof wer thatched with straw,
A King would be a peasant
For my cot and Annie Law.
