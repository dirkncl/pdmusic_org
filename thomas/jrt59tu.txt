1. This the word beyond all others, 
Makes us love our country most, 
Makes us feel that we are brothers, 
And a heartunited host!— 
With hosanna let our banner, 
From the housetops be unfurl’d, 
While the union builds her station 
With the mightiest of the world!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Take your harps from silent willows, 
Shout the chorus of the free: 
“States are all distinct as billows, 
Union one— as is the sea!”

2. From the land of graves that have us, 
He’s a traitor who would swerve! 
By the flag now waving o’er us, 
We the compact will preserve! 
Those who gain’d it and sustain’d it, 
Were unto each other true, 
And the fable well is able 
To instruct us what to do!
