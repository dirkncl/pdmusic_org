1. Home is where affections bind 
Gentle hearts in union, 
Where the voices all are kind, 
Holding sweet communion; 
Home is where the heart can rest 
Safe from dark’ning sorrow 
Where the friends we love the best 
Brighten ev’ry morrow.

CHORUS 1
Home is where the friends we love 
To our hearts are given, 
Where the blessings from above 
Make its seem a heaven.

2. Home is where congenial hearts 
All are kindly blended, 
Where no treasure e’er departs 
And no sweets are ended; 
Home is where the stars will shine 
To the skies above us, 
Peeping brightly thro’ the vine 
Train’d by those who love us.

CHORUS 2
Yes ’tis home where smiles of cheer 
Wreath the brows that greet us, 
And the one of all most dear 
Ever comes to meet us.
