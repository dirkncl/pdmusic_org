1. My home, my old familiar home, 
Belov’d so long and well, 
My roving heart to thee would come 
In peaceful rest to dwell! 
My careless youth here joyous sped, 
When life was new, was new and bright. 
And romance o’er its morning shed 
A gay and golden light. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
My home, my old familiar home 
Belov’d so long and well, 
My roving heart to thee would come 
In peaceful rest, in rest to dwell, 
In peaceful rest, In peaceful rest to dwell.

2. I turn a fond delight ed eye 
Upon these scenes so dear, 
That, rising love— tipt to the sky, 
On memor’s verge appear. 
Here friendship gave its earliest kiss, 
And love its first, its first carress. 
And fancy painted fture bliss 
From childish happiness.     

3. My home, my old familiar home, 
Where’er my lot is cast 
To thee shall memory ever come 
And ponder on the past. 
Tho hearts that now are still and cold 
Shall live again, again in thee. 
Shall welcome with the warmth of old 
And cheer and comfort me.
