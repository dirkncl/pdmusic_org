1. Give me the Rose, ’tis the sweetest of flow’rs, 
For it blooms when all others are dead; 
As in spring’s sunny morn, so in winter’s dark hours 
It lifts up its beautiful head. 
The raindrop may rest on its fair bud awhile 
Or the storm o’er its crest may rush by, 
Yet it reeks not the blast for in gloom it will smile, 
And the rage of the tempest defy! 
The rage of the tempest defy!

2. Give me the Rose, ’tis the sweetest of flow’rs, 
Tho’ it fall and return to the earth, 
Oh, it’s still living breath in the zephyr it pours, 
As it did on the day of its birth; 
Even so may I die, thus leaving behind 
A never decaying perfume, 
Then my name shall still flourish like mem’ry enshrin’d, 
Regardless of death and the tomb, 
Reguardless of death and the tomb.
