1. Eilleen Allanna, Eilleen Asthore
Light of my soul and its Queen evermore
It seems years have lingered since last we did part,
Eilleen Allanna, the pride of my heart,
Oh! darling lov'd one your dear smile I miss,
My lips seem to cling to that sweet parting kiss,
Mavourneen thy dear face I see at the door,
Eilleen Allanna Augus Asthore.

2. Eilleen Allanna, Eilleen Asthore
The oceans blue waters wash by the shore
Of that dear land of shamrock where thou dost abide,
Waiting the day when I'll call thee my bride.
God bless you darling I know you are true.
True to the boy, who would die now for you,
My heart is now bleeding to its innermost core,
Eilleen Allanna Augus Asthore.
