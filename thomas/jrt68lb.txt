1.
What does little birdie say
In her nest at peep of day?
Let me fly, says little birdie,
Mother, let me fly away,
Birdie, rest a little longer,
'Till the little wings are stronger,
So she rests a little longer,
Then she flies away;
  So she rests a little longer,
  Then she flies away.

2.
What does little baby say
In her bed at peep of day?
Baby says, like little birdie,
Let me rise and fly away.
Baby, sleep a little longer,
'Till the little limbs are stronger,
If she sleeps a little longer,
Baby too shall fly away,
  If she sleeps a little longer,
  Baby too shall fly away.
