1. Cross and Crown! Oh sweet the story 
That ye breathe unto us now! 
Round ye beams our Saviour’s glory, 
While before His throne we bow! 
Life and light of all our living! 
Comfort in our nights of woe! 
All our love and praise receiving; 
All our hope and joy  below! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Cross and Crown! Oh, sweet the story 
That ye breathe unto us now! 
Round ye beams our Saviour’s glory, 
While before His throne we bow!

2. Cross and Crown! ye lead us kindly 
In the ways of love and light! 
Where thou art we follow blindly, 
Trusting in thy heav’nly might! 
Still on Thee we look while sorrow 
Falls upon the earthly way! 
Faith shall wear the Crown tomorrow, 
Tho’ it bears the Cross today! 

3. Cross and Crown! ye bring before us 
Visions of our Saviour’s pain! 
Round ye falls the angel’s chorus, 
In our hearts He lives again. 
Still on Thee in grief relying, 
Tho’ the storms of earth may frown, 
In the light of heav’n undying, 
Thro’ the Cross we gain the Crown!
