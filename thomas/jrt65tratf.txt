There is a Reaper whose name is Death, 
And with his sickle keen, 
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath, 
And the flow’rs that grow between; 
“Shall I have nought that is fair” saith he, 
“Have nought but the bearded grain? 
Tho’ the breath of these flow’rs is sweet to me, 
I will give them all back again.” 
He gaz’d at the flow’rs with tear ful eyes, 
He kiss’d their drooping leaves; 
It was for the Lord of Paradise, 
He bound them in his sheaves. 
“My Lord has need of these flow’rets gay” 
The Reaper said and smil’d; 
“Dear tokens of the earth are they 
Where he was once a child. 
They all shall bloom in fields of light, 
Transplanted by my care 
And Saints, up on their garments white, 
These sacred blossoms wear.” 
And the mother gave, in tears and pain 
The flow’rs she most did love; 
She knew she should find them all again 
In the fields of light above; 
She knew she should find them all again 
In the fields of light above.
