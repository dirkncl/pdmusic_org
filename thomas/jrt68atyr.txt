1. All the year round!
All the year round!
What are the seasons to you or to me?
Summer may go;
Bleak winds may blow;
Roses crown winter if cheery we be.
Sounds of the glad Spring,
Pleasures the birds bring,
These live in loving hearts wherever found;
Sweet as the May-time,
Sweet as the hay-time,
So sweet are loving lips,
All the year round!

2. All the year round!
All the year round!
Why should we sorrow when Autumn leaves fall?
Breezes that sigh,
Passing us by,
Surely are pinning enough for us all.
Green leaves will come soon,
Birds will be home soon;
Lilies but hide awhile under the ground.
Hearts have no season;
That's a good reason
Why we should happy be,
All the year round!

3. All the year round!
All the year round!
O for the hand that is kindly and true!
O for the eyes,
Beaming and wise,
Truthful and tender, and clear as the dew!
Out on the rosebloom,
Out on the snow's tomb,
Still shines the light of Home where rest is found;
Here was assemble,
Though rafters tremble;
Winter will never last
All the year round!
