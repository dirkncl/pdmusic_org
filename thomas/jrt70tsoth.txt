1. While roving 'mid the dewy vales,
When winds are sweet and low,
Where warbling birds and blooming flow'rs
Around us, around us glance and glow,
How oft a summer cloud above,
With gloom our pathway fills;
Though far away we see with joy
There's sunlight on the hills!
Though far away we see with joy
There's sunlight on the hills!
There's sunlight-- there's sunlight--
There's sunlight on the hills!

2. When happy hours have pass'd away,
And clouds above us glide;
When summer friends who shar'd our joys,
And loved ones, and loved ones leave our side,
Each fleeting ray we may recall,
Though gloom our pathway fills;
For Hope will whisper while we sigh;
There's sunlight on the hills!
For Hope will whisper while we sigh;
There's sunlight on the hills!
There's sunlight-- there's sunlight--
There's sunlight on the hills!
