1. The clouds are gray, the wind is keen, 
  The frosty air is cold; 
We say with sadness in the heart, 
  “The year is growing old!” 
The grim old year! No tears has he, 
His limbs are strong, his arms are free, 
He shouts aloud a shout of glee, 
  When stormy winds are loud.

2. He saw the tender buds of May
  Breathe out their faint perfume;
He saw the roses flushing red,
  The stately lillies bloom!
The proud old year! no sigh has he,
Though balm and bloom forgotten be,
Though birds are silent on the tree,
  And stormy winds are loud!

3. He saw the grapes in autumn’s prime
  Grow purple with the wine,
The orchards drop their glowing fruit,
  The woods in glory shine.
The brave old year! though boughs are bare,
And tempests mutter in the air,
His kingly heart is strong to dare,
  When stormy winds are loud!
