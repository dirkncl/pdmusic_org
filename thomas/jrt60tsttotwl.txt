1. ’Tis sweet to think of those we love, 
And bring their faces back again; 
As in those hours ere doom’d to rove, 
And break the links in friendship’s chain; 
To see the smiles to mem’ry dear; 
That made life’s pathway seem so gay, 
And chase away the glist’ning tear,  
We shed for woes in life’s young day.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
’Tis sweet to think of those we love, 
And bring their faces back again; 
As in those hours ere doom’d to rove, 
And break the links in friendship’s chain.

2. ’Tis sweet to think of those we love, 
Tho’ cypress leaves hang o’er them now; 
Our thoughts will wander far above, 
And gaze upon the long lov’d brow; 
Thus mem’ries sweet entwining yet 
Affection’s truth, will ever prove, 
For kindred hearts will ne’er forget, 
But shed fond tears for those we love.
