1. What are the words that he murmurs in dying, 
Sadly they break on the death quiet round, 
“Tender and true” low he cries “Poor Carlotta” 
With a glory of love the dread moment is crown’d. 
Not a man of his guard but whose stern heart beats faster 
As those tender words gently fall on his ear, 
Not a woman who hears how this loving heart perish’d 
Shall he restrain the deep sigh, or repress the soft tear 
“Poor Carlotta!” “Poor Carlotta!”

2. Firmly he looks on the doom bearing rifles 
Calmly he meets face to face, cruel death; 
His heart’s far away in the land of his fathers, 
Poor Carlotta he sighs with his last dying breath! 
Bard never sang of a love more devoted, 
Heart never beat with affection more true, 
His soul on his lips in the hour supreme faithful, 
To “Car “Carlotta” he sighs forth his last fond adieu! 
“Poor Carlotta!” “Poor Carlotta!”
