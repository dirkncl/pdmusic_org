1. Come gather round, the fire my boys, 
Lay on another rail, 
And send the blaze up heavenwards, 
To light us on our trail. 
Brave Union men, yes, ev’ry one, 
Our duty in the main, 
We’re sworn to do, with courage true, 
We’ll vote for Grant again.

CHORUS [sung after verse]
We’ll vote for Grant again, my boys, 
We’ll vote for Grant again; 
United North, South, East and West, 
We’ll vote for Grant again, Hurrah!

2. When war o’erspread our noble land, 
And treason reign’d supreme, 
When traitors dared to show their hand, 
And boast aloud their scheme. 
When Union me, were driven from 
Their homes, none dared remain, 
’Twas he who fought their battles, boys, 
We’ll vote for Grant again.

3. Throughout the land let all unite, 
And march unto the fray; 
Our Country’s good, demands that we 
Should strive to win the day. 
May all our troubled waters calm, 
And peace and friendship reign: 
United North, South, East and West, 
We’ll vote for Grant again.
