1. Wake from thy happy dreams! 
Pure as the morning beams! 
Lov’d ones around thee wait thy gentle voice to hear; 
Wake for the robin sings, 
On gay and sunlit wings, 
While down the gleaming vale low zephyrs whisper near, 
Elfins in silence roam, 
Back to their mossy home, 
Warn’d by the waking rose, lur’d by the purling streams, 
Angels who guard thy sleep, 
Wing now the azure deep, 
Wake from thy happy dreams! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Wake from thy happy dreams! thy happy! happy! 
Wake from thy happy dreams!

2. Wake from thy happy dreams! 
Hope o’er thy pillow beams! 
Love’s gentle cares are thine lose not the blissful day; 
Fair skies are o’er thee now, 
Fond kisses gem thy brow, 
Borne on the tide of years, young pleasures fade away, 
Pure may thy visions be! 
Life’s roses bloom for thee, 
When childhood’s feet no more stray by the woodland streams, 
While buds and leaves are roll’d, 
In flames of shining gold, 
Wake from thy happy dreams!
