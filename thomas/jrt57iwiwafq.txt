1.
I wish were a royal fay,
My robes of rose leaves flowing-light,
My sceptre from a jamine spray.
My crown of dewdrop, dewdrop diamonds bright;
WHen call'd in elfin halls to sine,
I'd hasten to the festal spot,
And zephyrs round my brow should twine
Weaths of the blue forget-me-not
I'd make my throne; some graceful rose,
My canopy its foliage green,
I'd wander earth where'er I chose,
If I were but a fairy queen.

2.
I'd spend to all the haunts of woe,
And bid the gloomy shade depart,
I'd still the tortured spirit's throne,
And whisper hope in ev'ry, ev'ry heart;
To churlish boors I'd never give,
The treasures, meant mankind to cheer,
All those who on this earth would live
Should each be to the other dear;
I have the will-- the might had I,
This earth should teem with joy I ween,
But, I can only dream and sigh,
I wish I were a fairy queen.
