1. Here's a hand for the loyal and loving,
Here's a hand for the noble and true,
Here's a hand for the kind and the trustful,
Here's a hand for the weak ones too.
Here's a hand for the glorious patriot.
Here's a hand for our friends, old and new,
Here's a heart for the heart, which is grateful,
Here's a heart for the weak ones too.

2. Here's a hand for the sad, lonely stranger,
Here's a hand, my poor brother, for you,
Here's a heart for the rich, who are kindly,
Here's a heart for the weak ones too.
Here's a heart for our homes and our country.
Here's a heart for the Red, White and Blue,
Here's a heart for our fearless defenders,
Here's a heart for the weak ones too.
