1. Beautiful snow-drops! beautiful snow-drops!
Coming when earth is so drear;
Sweetest of blossoms; peeping in gladness;
Telling that Summer is near!
Calm in the tempest; lowly and cheerful:
Smiling in sunlight and rain;
Dear in my childhood; oft have I sought thee
Far over valley and plain.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Beautiful snow-drops! beautiful snow-drops!
Coming when earth is so drear;
Sweetest of blossoms; peeping in gladness;
Telling that Summer is near!

2. Beautiful snow-drops! beautiful snow-drops!
Fade not, O! fade not a-way!
Teach us thy meekness, teach us contentment;
Whisper that soon will be May!
Sweetest of mem'ries come at thy bidding,
Emblems of hearts that we love!
Cheerful in darkness, hopeful in sadness,
Constant wherever we rove!
