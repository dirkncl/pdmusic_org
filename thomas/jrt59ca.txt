1. They're coming agin with the summer hours,
The flow'rs we have miss'd so long;
Again will the earth be crown'd with joy,
The air be fill'd with song.
Oh! welcome, thrice welcome they all shall be,
As they wake from their winter sleep,
And welcome the thoughts of their smiles shall still
Alive in my mem'ries keep;
Each bud as it opens revives the past,
Whisp'ring its own sweet song
Then welcome again the summer days
And the flow'rs we have miss'd so long!
  The welcome again the summer days
  And the flow'rs we have miss'd so long!

2. They're coming again the absent friends,
Absent tho' present still,
And thrilling words from hearts rejoin'd
The summer air shall fill;
What then will the days of parting seem,
The nights of watching be,
When ev'ry breeze as it swept along
Bore pray'rs across the sea.
Pain shall be only remember'd then
As the chimes of some old sad song,
And gladly we'll welcome the flow'rs again,
And the friends we had miss'd so long!
  And gladly we'll welcome the flow'rs again,
  And the friends we had miss'd so long!
