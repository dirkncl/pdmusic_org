I met her in the ev'ning,
When the moon shone bright and clear,
And as I gazed on that pale sad face,
Not a smile did I see there.

In youthful days I once did know,
A maiden fair and gay,
Whose sparkling, dark bewitching eyes,
Caused many a heart to sway.
  Caused many a heart to sway.

That little maid's a woman grown
And Love with Cupid-dart,
Hath seized upon her as his own,
Then played the traitor's part;
Sorrow then no more fair angel,
Give o'er that burning grief.
Place thy trust in God above thee,
Place thy trust in God above thee,
And He will send relief.
