1. Though I beneath a southern sky 
A kindly wwelcome meet, 
Or northern snowclad mountains high 
Support my weary feet 
Dear native land still thoughts of thee 
Pursue where e’er I roam 
And oh! I long, I long to see 
My dear, my native home.

CHORUS 1
My dear my native home, 
My dear my native home, 
And oh! I long, I long to see 
My dear, my natvie home.

2. Could I my roving steps retrace 
To thee, far distant shore, 
And rest me in my native place, 
I ne’er would wander more; 
Not all the wealth this world can boast, 
Should tempt me then to roam 
For all this heart now values most 
Surrounds my native home. 

CHORUS 2
Surrounds my native home, 
Surrounds my native home, 
For sll this heart now values most, 
Surrounds my native home.
