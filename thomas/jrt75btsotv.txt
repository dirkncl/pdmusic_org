1. Her face is as fair as the daises of spring, 
Her smile is a sunbeam of joy to my heart; 
Her sweet words of welcome, what gladness they bring! 
They linger to bless me when sunbeams depart. 
Her fair golden tresses, bewitching and bright, 
To dazzle the eyes of the lads never fail! 
But true to her promise, as stars to the night, 
Is Bessie, sweet Bessie the star of the vale! 
The star of the vale, the star of the vale, 
Is Bessie, sweet Bessie the star of the vale!

2. Her love is a treasure of worth all untold, 
And life would be sad if she were not my own; 
What joy, when we meet, her dear hands to enfold, 
And know that she loves me and loves me alone. 
We meet in the valley, when daylight is o’er, 
And stars of the twilight are twinkling so pale; 
The bright days may go; but I’ll love more and more, 
My Bessie, sweet Bessie the star of the vale! 
The star of the vale, the star of the vale, 
My Bessie, sweet Bessie the star of the vale!
