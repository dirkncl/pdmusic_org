1.
Fare well, fare well is often heard
 From the lips of those who part
'Tis a whispered tone, a gentle word
 But it comes from the heart,
It may serve fro the lover's closing lay
 To be sung 'neath a summer sky
But give to me the lips that say
 The honest words "good-bye"!

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Good bye [etc.]

2.
The mother sending for her child,
 To meet with a cares and strife
Breathes through her tears, her doubts, her fears,
 For the loved one's future life.
No cold "Adieu," no "Farewell" lives
 Within her choking sigh
But the deepest sob of anguish gives;--
 "God bless thee, boy, Good-Bye!"

3.
Go, watch the pale and dying one,
 When the glance has lost its beam--
When the brow is cold as the marble stone
 And the world's a passing dream;
And the latest presssure of the hand,
 The look of the closing eye,
Yield what the heart must understand,
 A long, a last "Good-bye."
