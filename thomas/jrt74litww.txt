1.
Lost in the wide world, hopeless and weary,
Gone is the gladness that made life so drear!
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary,
No smile to cheer me is lingering near!
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses;
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more;

[Refrain/CHORUS sung after each verse]
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore!

2.
Lost in the wide world wand'ring in sadness,
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears!
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness,
"Loved onea sre waiting, then hush all thy fears!"
Oh, how I miss them, life's lovely roses!
Sweet voices call me to yon further shore!
