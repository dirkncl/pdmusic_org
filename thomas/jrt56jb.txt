1.
  Come all you darkies listen, and I'll tell you what befel
A very pretty yellow girl-- Miss Julietta Bell;
Whose playful wiles and withching smiles distracted ev'ry heart,
She had a score of beaux or more, so well she played her part.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Julietta Bell, 
Julietta Bell,
Juli- Juli- Juli- Juli-
Julietta Bell!

2.
  When first I saw miss Julie she had love in every feature,
And put her face so close to mine the dear, the charming creature,
I felt compelled to press her lips for fear she'd think me cold,
She only said "you naughty man, how could you be so bold?"

3.
  I thought I'd made a conquest but I soon felt mighty small,
For meeting with my charmer at a colored fancy hall,
I asked her if she'd dance with me not thinking she'd refuse me,
She turned away replying "I'm engaged sir, pray excuse me."

4.
  Next day I saw her walking and I thought I would resent it,
And like a fool went up to ask her if she meant it;
She struck and attitude like Forrest when he tries to 'smash' us,
"Go 'way" said she, "I'll call the p'lice, you're getting quite awdashes."

5.
  I thought 'twas time to cut__ ([another voice] Cut what your throat?) no, cut my stick;
And she has met the fate of all who lay it on too thick;
Her beaux they dropped off one by one her hopes forever quashing,
Miss Julie's occupation gone, and now__ she takes in washing.
