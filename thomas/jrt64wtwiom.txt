1.
Sadly now the breeze is moaning,
Crossroads all around me sleep,
But my thoughts are far away love,
While my lonely watch I keep;
Fondly now my heart is telling,
Joys that coming days will bring,
When the war is over Mary,
When the bells of Peace shall ring.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Weep no more for me dear Mary,
Soon I'll clasp you to my heart,
When the war is over, Mary,
We shall meet no more to part.

2.
In the long and weary marches,
In the battles fearful din,
Where our true and noble soldiers,
Fame and honor strive to win;
Like the starlight love has cheer'd me,
Shining o'er me in the gloom,
And your words of kindness Mary,
Make my heart with pleasure bloom.

3.
Love, the keepsake that you gave me
To my lips I fondly press,
O, how blissful are the mem'ries
As I kiss the golden tress!
Bravely hope the best dear Mary,
Tho' the days are long and drear,
For the darkest hours you know love,
Show the rosy dawn is near.
