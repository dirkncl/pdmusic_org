1.
Little Blossom, Little Blossom,
Pattering across the floor,
Chasing sunbeams on the carpet
That were never chased before,
Little Darling, need I wonder
Where the charm to please me lies
When I see you looking at me
With your mother's hazel eyes?

CHORUS [sung after verse]
Little Blossom, come caress me
With those snowy arms of thine,
Little Blossom, come and kiss me,
Come and press you lips to mine.

2.
Little Blossom, Little Blossom,
As life's happy moments flow,
May they only leave the sunshine
In the path where you must go,
Little Darling, fairer roses
May have bloomed in other bow'rs
But for us there is no blossom
Like this little one of ours.

3.
Little Blossom, Little Blossom,
Still among the sunbeams stay,
Till your life through them grows brighter
As the skies grow bright in May,
Little Darling, kiss your mother
For yourself and yet for me,
For the hazel eyes that won me
Unto her I see in thee.
