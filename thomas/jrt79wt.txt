1. We two wander'd in the dell
When 'twas golden weather;
We two liked each other well
While we strayed together.
We two watched the birdies there,
Merry little rovers!
We two, in the sunlight fair,
Lingered happy lovers!
  We two in the sunlight fair,
  Lingered happy lovers!

2. We two spoke of pleasant hours
That the year was bringing;
We two culled the lovely flowers
Round about us springing.
We two wandered from the dell,
Sweetest hopes expressing;
Who we two are you may tell,
If you're good at guessing!
  Who we two are you may tell,
  If you're good at guessing!
