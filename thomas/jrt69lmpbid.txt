     “A poor, Motherless boy was found ‘stowed away’ on board of
an English Steamer. He told the Mate, whose duty it was to look 
after such cases, that: “he had been put aboard by a relation.”
The Mate not believing the story, and suspecting some of the
crew in the matter, told the boy that he had but two minutes to
live, and advised him to speak the truth and save his life.
“Oh,” said the little fellow, “I’ve told all the truth; but let
me pray before I die!”
                              Extract _from a recent Newspaper._

1.
Sad and weary, far from home;
None to help or save him there;
Pale as angry ocean's foam,
Knell the ragged boy in prayer.
Gently bowed his noble head;
Mother watch'd him from the sky!
These the only words he said:
"Let me pray before I die!"

2.
Pale and tearful all around;
Hushed the noise of breeze and wave;
Cords are brought, his hands are bound;
All are silent as the grave.
Mild blue eyes are raised in prayer;
Death and parting bring no sigh;
"Please, one moment, do but spare?"
"Let me pray before I die!"

3.
Soften'd then the sailor stood:
Lo! he heeds that pleading form!
Brave his heart and kind and good;
Brightly fall the teardrops warm.
Swift he flew as ocean birds,
There amid the joyful cry,
Kissed the lips that breathed the words:
"Let me pray before I die!"
