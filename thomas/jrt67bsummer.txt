[TRIO. [SAB] A faster.]
1. Into the regions whose magical light 
Keeps the heart’s treasures eternally bright; 
There, with their glory untouched by decay, 
Wait the sweet years that have vanished away,— 
Wait the sweet years that have vanished away.

2. Many a summer shall brighten the earth,
Many a blossom to beauty have birth;
Never, O never, on valley and plain,
Dawn the sweet years that have vanished, again,—
Dawn the sweet years that have vanished, again.

3. Gather the roses of youth as they bloom,
Treasure their brightness, and breathe their perfume;
Life hath new mornings to gladden thy way,
Sweet as the years that have vanished away,—
Sweet as the years that have vanished away.
