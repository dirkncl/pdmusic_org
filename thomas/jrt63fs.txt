1. Give to the lord his palace grand,
And halls of spendid pride;
A fig for all hi dignities,
And all his pomp, his pomp beside!
Give me the farmer's peaceful home,
Beneath the maples high,
Where nature's warbles wake the song,
The waters prattling nigh.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then here's to him who tills the soil,
The true, the strong, the brave!
Without him Art would fly the land,
And Commerce leave the wave.

2. What tho' the bronze is on our check,
Toil calloused is our hand,
With honest prode we stand erect,
The noble's, noble's of the land!
For "patriot truth," that spirit bright
In this wide world so rare,
Points proudly to the Farmer's home,
And cries-- my own are there!
