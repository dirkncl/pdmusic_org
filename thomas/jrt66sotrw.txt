1. Softly o’er the rippling waters 
Wander strains of melody, 
While the sun, in glory dying, 
Sinks below the golden sea. 
Echoes on my heart are falling, 
Dreams of other days arise, 
Happy dreams of dear ones dwelling 
Far in yonder purple skies.

CHORUS (ad lib.) [sung after each verse]
Hark! Hark! the angels whisper, 
And they waft in holy pow’r, 
Sounds of peace to those who sor-row, 
In the twilight’s tranquill hour.

2. Softly o’er the rippling waters 
Early stars in beauty shine, 
Loving arms are  twining round me, 
Loving lips are pressing mine. 
Sad yet sweet is mem’ry’s vision, 
Sadder still to bid farewell! 
Who would sigh could we but lingger, 
Never more to break the spell!
