1. There is music in the flowing,
Pleasant flowing, of the stream;
There is beauty in the glowing
Of the midnight's lovely beam;
But the beauty and the brightness
Of the world would take their flight,
If we nevermore could listen
To the children's sweet good-night,
  If we nevermore could listen
  To the children's sweet good-night.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
How its echo falls around us!
How it lingers in delight!
Like a whisper of the angels,
Is the children's sweet good-night!

2. When the toils of day are ended,
And the spirit longs to rest;
When in joy our feet have wended
To our little household nest;
Dimpled arms that clasp us fondly,
All our weary cares requite,
And we live again our childhood
In the children's sweet good-night,
  And we live again our childhood
  In the children's sweet good-night.

3. Some have wander'd from our keeping
To the far off better shore;
Mother-eyes are fondly weeping
For their lov'd who came no more!
But, when earth is pass'd forever,
In that home of pure delight,
Oh, what joy again to listen
To the children's sweet good-night.
  Oh, what joy again to listen
  To the children's sweet good-night.
