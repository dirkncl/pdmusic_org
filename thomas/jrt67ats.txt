1. Oh! sweetly passed the hours away,
The skies were calm and blue;
The year was in the golden May,
And hearts were young and true!
 And hearts wer young and true!
We floated gently down the tide,
In Love's delightful dream,
For who, when boats will softly glide,
Would pull against the stream!
  For who, when boats will softwly glide,
  Would pull against the stream.

2. An idle word,- we hardly knew
The time, or how it fell;
A cloud upon Love's charming blue,
And broken was the spell,
  And broken was the spell.
On! sunny eyes in sad eclipst,
No more would fondly beam,
With severed hands and pouting lips
We'd float against the stream!
  With severed hands and pouting lips,
  We'd float against the stream!

3. But summer show'rs we know are fleet,
And dearer make the sun;
And words that reconcile are sweet
When hearts again are won!
  When hearts again are won.
And when togeher side by side,
While olden glances gleam,
How dear the words, "Oh! let us glide
No more against the stream!"
How dear the words, "Oh, let us glide
no more against the stream!"
