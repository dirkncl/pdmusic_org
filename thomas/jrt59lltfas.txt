1.
Lady love, the flowers are sleeping 
'Neath the moonbeam's mellow light,
Pearly tears bright stars are weeping, 
Dearest wake thine own sings tonight.
Do I love thee, One above thee
Knows my hearts is thine alone,
Ah believe me, I'll ne'er grieve thee, 
Thou who art my love, my own.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh Lady love, the flowers are sleeping
'Neath the moonbeam's mellow light,
Pearly tears bright stars are weeping
Dearest wake, thine own one sings tonight.

2.
Lattice, Lady mine, 
Kneeling 'mid the dewy flowers,
Vesper bells with voices fine, 
Measure forth the starry hours.
Farewell dearest, if thou hearest 
What thy loved one sings to thee,
May my numbers bring sweet slumbers, 
Happy dreams, sweet thoughts of me.
