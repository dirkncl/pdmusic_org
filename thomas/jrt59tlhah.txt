1. 
I am musing, fondly musing o’er the scenes of former days, 
Of the cottage in the valley where  oft my fancy strays; 
When each morning brought new pleasures unalloy’d by grief or pain, 
And the last wish of the ev’ning was for morn to come again. 
Now I think I see before me the friends of early youth, 
With their cheerful smiles of kindness and their words of honest truth; 
And I prize them as a treasure, for as thro’ the world I roam, 
I have found none half so loving as the loving hearts at home!

2. 
Years have swiftly gild ed o’er me since I left those hearts so true— 
But, the greetings of our childhood we shall soon again renew; 
And the glad thought cheers my spirit like a joyous festal chime, 
Ringing out o’er hill and meadow in the golden summer time. 
Oh! in fancy now I’m gazing on each well remember’d face, 
And I’m list’ning to the welcomes in the old familiar place; 
And I prize them as a treasure, for as thro’ the world I roam— 
There is nothing, oh! there’s nothing like the loving hearts at home!
