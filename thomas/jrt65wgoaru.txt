1. While gentle ones are round us, 
O shield and love them well; 
How long their forms may greet us, 
O who of us may tell; 
Then should they fade before us 
And leave us here alone 
How bright will dwell in mem’ry 
Their smiles when they are gone. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
While gentle ones are round us 
O shield and love them well! 
How long their forms may greet us 
O! who of us may tell.

2. What sorrow to remember, 
The joys we might have shared; 
The angry words were spoken, 
And pain we could have spared! 
The fairest flow’rs of mem’ry 
That will for ever bloom, 
Are deeds of love and kindness, 
To dear ones in the tomb!
