1.
There's a lass of beauty rare,
With blue eyes and golden hair
One who meets me often in the shady lane;
And she loves me well I know,
Tho' she's never told me so,
And I know I dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane,
There's a charm about the girl,
More than dainty eye or curl;
More than all that lover's fancies may beguile,
'Tis a good and loving heart
That from me will never part
I can read it in her happy truthful smile.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
There's a loss of beauty rare,
With blue eyes and golden hair,
One who meets me often in the shady lane,
And she loves me well I know,
Tho' she never told me so,
And I know I dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane.

2.
Come there sunshine or come storm
There's a gentle fairy form
That will ever cheer life's path as forth we go;
Come then sadness or come joy,
There's a peace without alloy,
For the hearts that ever trust each other so,
Those blue eyes may gently fade,
As we go down earth's fair glade,
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold,
Yet along life's varied strand
As we wander hand in hand
We shall never, never let our hearts grow old.
