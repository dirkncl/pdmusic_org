1. Queen of the night, 
Hours of delight, 
Wake for us, darling, 
O! linger not long. 
Voices of day 
Die for away, 
Zephyrs no more sing their murmuring song. 
Wake from thy dreams! 
Fair silver beams 
Weave thee a throne that is lovely and bright! 
Lonely I wait, 
Down by the gate, 
Come in thy splendor; thou Queen  of the night! 
Lonely I wait, 
Down by the gate;

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Come in thy splendor, thou Queen of the night! 
Queen! Queen! Queen of the night!

2. Parted from thee, 
Life’s weary sea 
Bears me along to my sorrow and gloom; 
Sunny rays fade, 
Night’s deep’ning shade. 
Finds me once more near blest islands of bloom. 
Fast fly the hours, 
Rosecluster’d bowers 
Wait for thy coming in dew gleaming light; 
Dawn on my heart, 
Never to part, 
Come in thy splendor, thou Queen of the night! 
Dawn on my heart, 
Never to part;

Come in thy splendor, thou Queen of the night! 
Queen! Queen! Queen of the night!
