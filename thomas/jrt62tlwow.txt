1.
Upon the couch of death
The champion of the free,
Gave with his parting breath
This solemn legacy:
"Sheath'd be the battle blade,
And hush'd the cannon's thunder;
The glorious Union God hath made,
Let no man rend asunder!

2.
War hanish from the land,
Peace cultivate with all;
United let us stand,
Divided we must fall!
Cemented with our blood
The Union keep unriven!"
While freemen heard the counsel good,
His spirit soar'd to heav'n.
