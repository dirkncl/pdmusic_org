1. I've loved thee long, I’ve loved thee long,
Since childhood’s charms bedeck’d thy brow,—
When first amid the festive throng,
I claim’d thee with a solemn vow;
I deem’d thee then surpassing fair,
For thou hadst known nor care nor ill,
And as I gaz’d upon thee there,
I lov’d thee, and I love thee still! 
  And as I gaz’d upon thee there,
  I lov’d thee, and I love thee still!
I love thee still!
I love thee still!


2. I’ve loved thee long, I’ve loved thee long,
In childhood and in sunny youth,
With pure affection firm as strong,
Seal’d in the sacred bond of truth;
And tho' upon thy cheek no more
The hues of youth in beauty blend,
I love thee as in days of yore,
And I will love thee to the end!
  I love thee as in days of yore,
  And I will love thee to the end!
Aye! to the end!
To the end!
