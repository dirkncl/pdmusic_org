1. This world would be a dreary waste, 
Uncheer’d by friendship’s voice, 
Which like the sun will glad the scene 
And make the heart rejoice, 
And make the heart rejoice; 
In sorrow’s dark and troubled hour, 
Its gentle ancents heard, 
Will chase away each gloomy thought 
With one kind, cheering word, 
Will chase away each gloomy thought 
With one kind, cheering word.

2. How many good, who might be great 
Still languish in the shade, 
Their virtues never brought to light 
Are left unknown to fade, 
Are left un known to fade; 
If friendship’s voice should interpose, 
What joy is then conferr’d 
The drooping heart is rais’d to hope 
By one kind, cheering word, 
The drooping heart Is rais’d to hope 
By one kind, cheering word.
