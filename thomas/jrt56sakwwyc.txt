1. What were life without some one to cheer us, 
With a word or a smile on our way— 
A friend who is faithfully near us, 
And heeds not what others may say. 
The bravest of spirits have often 
Half falled in the race that they ran, 
For a kind word, life’s hardships to soften. 
So say a kind word when you can.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So say a kind word, say a kind word, 
Say a kind word when you can.

2. Each one of us owns to some failing, 
Though some may have more that the rest; 
But there’s so good in heedlessly railing 
’Gainst those that are striving their best, 
Remember a word spoke complaining, 
May blight ev’ry effort and plan, 
Which a kind word would help in attaining, 
So say a kind word when you can.

3. Oh! say a kind word then whenever,
’Twill make the heart cheerful and glad—
But chiefly— forget it oh never—
To the one that is hopeless and sad.
For there’s no word so easy in saying;
So begin— if you have not begun—
And never in life be delaying,
To say a kind word when you can.
