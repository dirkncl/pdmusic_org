Tarry with me, O my Saviour; 
For the day is passing by; 
See the shades of ev’ning gather, 
And the night is drawing nigh, 
Swift the night of death advances; 
Shall it be the night of rest? 
Swift the night of death advances; 
Shall it be the night of rest? 
The night is drawing nigh. 
Deeper, deeper grow the shadows 
Paler now the glowing west. 
See the Feeble, trembling, fainting, dying, 
Lord, I caat myself on thee; 
Tarry with me thro’ the darkness, 
While I sleep, still watch by me. 
Tarry with me, O my Saviour! 
Lay my head upon thy breast 
Till the morning then awakes me— 
Morning of eternal rest, 
Morning of eternal rest.
