1.
Oh! could we meet!
Oh! could we meet!
I have so much to tell,
I feel my heart with longing beat,
And nigh to breaking swell;
As streamlets from the hills descend,
And gather lit the vale,
Then with their force all barriers rend,
And in their course prevail.
So rush my thoughts thine own to greet,
And break each hind'ring spell,
Oh! could we meet!
Oh! could we meet!
I have so much to tell.

2.
Oh! could we meet!
Oh! could we meet!
And in that old embrace
Reveal the past made doubly sweet
Beholding face to face
As bursts the dawn upon the night,
Disclosing all things fair,
So would thy presence to my sight
Bring joy and banish care
'Tis thus I muse in Love's retreat,
And 'gainst rude fate rebel.
Oh! could we meet,
Oh! could we meet,
I have so much to tell.
