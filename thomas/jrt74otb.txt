1. O, grandly flowing river! 
O, silver, gliding river! 
Thy springing willows shiver 
In the sunset as of old. 
They shiver in the silence 
Of the willow whiten’d islands, 
While the sunbars and the sandbars, 
Fill air, fill air and wave with gold! 
While the sunbars and the sandbars, 
Fill air, fill air and wave with gold!

2. O, gay, oblivious river! 
O, sunset kindled river! 
Do you remember ever, 
The eyes and skies so blue,  
On a summer day that shone here. 
When we were all alone here? 
And the blue eyes were too wise, 
too wise to speak the love they knew! 
And the blue eyes were too wise 
too wise to speak the love they knew!

3. O, stern, impassive river! 
O, still, unanswering river! 
The shiv’ring willows quiver, 
As nightwinds moan and rave, 
From the past a voice is calling; 
From heav’n a star is falling, 
And dew swells in the bluebells, 
above, above her hillside grave! 
And dew swells in the bluebells, 
beside her hillside grave!
