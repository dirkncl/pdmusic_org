1. She toss'd her sunny curls
At all who came to woo,
She laugh'd to scorn the pleas
Of hearts both leal and true;
And merrily she sang
All day in maiden sport:

[REFRAIN]
There are good fish in the sea
As ever yet were caught!
There are good fish in the sea
As ever yet were caught!

2. Upon their lightning wings
The merry years did glide,
And still the maiden walk'd
With no one by her side,
Yet as of old she sang,
Tho' few to win her sought,--

[REFRAIN]
There are good fish in the sea
As ever yet were caught!
There are good fish in the sea
As ever yet were caught!

3. At length the maiden grew
Exceedingly alarm'd,
For heaux had grown quite shy,--
Her face no longer charm'd;
And now she frets all day,
And sings, tho' not in sport,

[REFRAIN]
There are fishes in the sea,
But, oh! they won't be caught!
There are fishes in the sea,
But, oh! they won't be caught!
