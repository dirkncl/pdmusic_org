1.
The hopes gone by, the hopes that made
A golden path to other years;
Ere yet our hearts had known a shade,
Or life lost what life endears
The bounding heart, the spirit play
THe thoughts that seem's on wings to fly
We ask in vain ah! where are they--
The days the dreams the hopes gone by,
The days the dreams the hopes gone by.

2.
The brightness and the bloom have fled,
And life seems cold as wint'ry snow;
For some are changed and some are dead--
That knew and loved us long ago
Those golden visions come no more,
As once they came when hope was high
Yet dear till life's last pulse is o'er
Will be the days, the hopes gone by,
Will be the days, the hopes gone by.
