1. The chimney nook--old chimney nook,
For many a year hath been,
It often brings the past to mind
And keeps our mem'ries green;
Loved ones who long have pass'd away,
For whom in vain we look,
Come smiling o'er us as of old,
In the dear old chimney nook--
  Come smiling o'er us as of old,
  In the dear old chimney nook.

2. My father oft in the chimney nook,
Would take me on his knee;
And charm me with his wondrous tales
Of war and minstrelsy.
And when the night did onward glide,
He'd read the Holy Book,
And say "goodnight", and kiss my cheek,
In the dear old chimney nook--
  And say "goodnight", and kiss my cheek,
  In the dear old chimney nook.
