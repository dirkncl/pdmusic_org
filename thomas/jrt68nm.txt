1. The stars in the skies ne’er shone brighter, 
Nor moon shed more beautiful ray,— 
Yet darkness and sadness surround me, 
Because my sweet Nellie’s away. 
The birds have no songs to delight me,
The scent of the roes has flown; 
I’m thinking on Nellie my darling, 
My beautiful Nellie Malone. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come back to me quickly Mavourneen, 
Dispelling the dim shadows grown; 
My heart is so cheerless without you, 
Come back my own Nellie Malone.

2. Come back to me Nellie Acushla, 
Bring gladness to me once again,— 
Bring gladness and joy to my pathway, 
Where all is now sorrow and pain. 
I’m happier far by your side love, 
Than ever was King on his throne; 
To thee shall my true heart turn ever, 
Come back my sweet Nellie Malone.
