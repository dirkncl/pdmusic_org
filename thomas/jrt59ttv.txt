(Performance note: This self-baring text,
obviously one of GPM's creator concealments,
is in the classic confessing person's third 
person, to save personal face.  But the things 
related could only be first person known, so 
I believe the only honest song presentation 
has to be in first person throughout. This is 
a splendid American "verismo opera" aria long 
before we got verismo opera from Italy. HLC)


1.
She lov'd him-- but she heeded not--
Her heart had only room for pride!
All other feelings were forgot,
When she became another's bride,
As from a dream she then awoke,
To realize her lonely state,
And own it was the vow she broke
That left her drear and desolate!

2.
She lov'd him-- but the sland'rer came
With words of hate that all believ'd;
A stain thus rested on his name--
But he was wrong'd and she deceiv'd!
Ah! rash the act that gave her hand,
That drove her lover from her side--
Who hied him to a distant land,
Where, battling for a name, he died!

3.
She lov'd him-- and his mem'ry now
Was treasur'd from the world apart!
The shade of thought was on her brow,
The seeds of death, were in her heart,
For all the world that thing forlorn
She would not, could not be, and live--
That casket with its Jewel gone,
A bride who has no heart to give!
