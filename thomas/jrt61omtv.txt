1. Fling to the breeze the Patriot-flag; 
Its starry folds unfurl; 
Though rebels flaunt their recreant rag 
And fierce defiance hurl, 
Columbia’s sons, the brave, the free, 
Will onward march to victory! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Onward march, onward march, 
onward march to victory! 
Will onward march to victory!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Onward march, onward march, 
onward march to victory, 
Will onward march to victory!

2. If brother must ’gainst brother fight, 
And brothers’ blood must flow, 
God, as of yore, will guard the right 
And lay the traitor low!

3. The flag ’neath which our fathers fell—
’Neath which our brave have bled—
Shall, hallowed in our memory dwell,
Wave ever o’er our head!

4. As God has set His stars in heaven
Firm on their azure plain,
So shall the stars by Freedom given
Upon that flag remain!

5. Fling out the Patriot-flag on high—
In glory it shall wave—
Better a hero’s death to die;
Than live a traitor-knave!
