1.
O, the sweet and lovely children!
Blooming round us like the flow'rs;
Sunlight beams upon their faces,
And they gladden all the hours!
But the darkness of the winter
Meets us while we wander on,
When we listen for the footsteps--
Little footsteps that are gone!

2.
Where we heard the children wander,
Up and down the parlor floor,
O, the weary, weary stillness,
When they come, they come no more!
And we gather up our burdens,
Darkly then we journey on,
Never more to lead the footsteps--
Little footsteps that are gone!

3.
All about they used to patter,
Softly now they come in dreams!
Angelic eyes are watching o'er us,
Lovelight in their hallowed beams!
Where the streets are bright and golden,
Ah! we know they wander on;
O, the kindly hand that leads them--
Little footsteps that are gone!
