1. Night, holy night! 
Thy loving arms 
Round earth and sky are fondly twining! 
Thy touch hath quelled our vague alarms, 
Thy voice hath hush’d the heart’s repining, 
Our weary thougts, like birds of day, 
Now fold their wings in calm delight; 
Awake, sweet dreams!  thy steps delay 
Thou welcome, blast, and holy Night! 
Night, holy Night!

2. Night, holy night! 
We turn to thee; 
Thy hands can pour the balm of healing! 
When hearts are tossed on sorrow’s sea 
Thou dost not mock their mute appealing! 
Our tearful eyes have waited long 
To feel thy kiss of balmy rest! 
Then stay! oh stay! thy “mother song” 
Lull all to sleep upon thy breast! 
Night, holy Night!
