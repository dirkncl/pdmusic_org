1. O call it not a desert bare, 
This beauteous world below, 
Say not no flow’r of sympathy, 
For mis’ry, for mis’ry here doth grow; 
Affliction may have tried thee, 
Thy lot been hard to bear, 
Yet speak not so untruly, 
There are kind hearts ev’rywhere; 
Yet speak not so untruly. 
There are kind hearts ev’rywhere.

2. O call it not a mockery, 
This beauteous world of ours, 
Though full of lovely hopes that bloom, 
To perish, to perish like its flow’rs; 
Though dark clouds gather o’er thee, 
Ne’er yield thee to despair, 
This life hath still its sunshine, 
There are kind hearts ev’ry where; 
This life hath still its sunshine, 
There are kind hearts ev’rywhere.
