1.
Longing to tell thee how lonely are days
Passed from the sweetness of thy love's bright rays,
Cheerless and dreary, all hours are the same,
And I but whisper thy dearly loved name;
Oh! could I tell thee how dear is the past
When its bright mem'ries upon me are cast;--
Gladly I listen to hope's cheering strain--
Longing, still longing, to meet thee again.

2.
Bright were the days that were lit by thy smile,
Happiness seemed all our grief to beguile,
Joyously passed all the halcyon hours,
Lighted by sunshine and crowned with sweet flowers;
Passing on swiftly we heeded them not,
Troubles were brightened and sorrows forgot;
Now as I wander alone o'er life's plain,
Longing I'm longing to meet thee again.

3.
Longing to take thee again by the hand,--
Welcome thee back from a far distant land,
Longing to hear again thy dulcet voice,
Biding my heart to be glad and rejoice;
Longing to meet once more thy kindly smile
Beaming on me with its sweetness, the while,
Longing, you, longing through pleasure or pain,
Longing still longing to meet thee again!
