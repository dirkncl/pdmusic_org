O sing unto the Lord a new song; 
for he hath done mar v’lous things, 
With his own right hand and with his holy arm, 
hath he gotten himself the victory.
 The Lord declared his salvation, 
his righteousness has he openly 
showed in the sight of the heathen. 
He hath remember’d his mercy and truth 
toward the house of Israel, 
And all the ends of the world 
shall see the salvation of our God. 
Show yourselves joyful 
unto the Lord, all ye lands; 
sing, rejoice, and give thanks, 
With trumpets also and shawms, 
O show your selves joyful, 
Show yourselves joyful 
before the Lord the King. 
Praise the Lord upon the harp; 
sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving. 
Let the sea make a noise, 
and all that therein is; 
The round world, 
and all that dwell therein 
Let the floods clap their hands, 
and let the hills be joyful together 
before the Lord; for he cometh, 
he cometh to judge the earth 
With righteousness shall he judge the world, 
and the people with equity. 
Glory be to the Father, 
And to the Son, 
And to the Holy Ghost; 
As it was in the beginning, 
is now and ever shall be, 
World without end, 
Amen, Amen.
