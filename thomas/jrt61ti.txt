1. There was a lady lived at Leith,
A Indy very stylish, man,
And yet in spite of all her teeth,
She fell in love with an Irishman
A nasty ugly Irishman
A wild tremendous Irishman
A tearing swearing thumping bumping 
  ramping roaring Irishman.

He took so much of Lundy Foot
That he used to snort and snuffle O;
And in shape and size the follow's neck
Was as bad as the neck of a buffalo
O, the horrible Irishman,
The thundering blundering Irishman
The slashing, dashing, smashing, lashing, 
  thrashing, hashing Irishman.

2. His face was no ways beautiful,
For with small pox ’twas scarred across;
And the shoulders of the ugly dog
Were almost double a yard across
O the lump of an Irishman
The whiskey devouring Irishman
The great he rogue with his wonderful brogue,
The fighting rioting Irishman.

His name was a terrible name indeed,
Being Timothy Thady Mulligan;
And whenever he emptied his tumbler of punch,
He’d not rest till he filled it full again
The boosting, bruising Irishman,
The ’toxicated Irishman
The whiskey, frisky, rummy, grummy, 
  brandy no dandy Irishman.

3. One of his eyes was bottle green,
And the other eye was out my dear.
And the calves of his wicked looking legs
Were more than two fee about, my dear;
O the great bit Irishman
The rattling battling Irishman;
The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering, 
  leathering swash of an Irishman.

This was the lad the lady loved,
Like all the girls of quality;
And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith,
Just by the way of jollity;
O, the leathering Irishman,
The barbarous savage Irishman
The hearts of the maids and the gentlemen’s heads
Were bothered I’m sure by this Irishman.
