1. How gently falls those simple words
Upon the human heart,
When friends, long bound in strongest ties,
Are doom'd by death to part.
You sadly press the hand of those
Who thus in love caress you,
And soul responsive beats to soul,
In breathing out, "God bless you!"
  And soul responsive beats to soul,
  In breathing out, "God bless you!"

2. The mother sending forth her boy
To scenes untried and new,
Lisps not a studied stately speech,
Nor murmurs out, "Adieu!"
She sadly says, between her sobs,
Whene'er misfortune press you,
Come to thy mother-- boy come back!
Then fondly sighs, "God bless you!"
  Come to thy mother-- boy come back!
  Then fondly sighs, "God bless you!"

3. "God bless you!" more of love bespeaks
Than volumes without number;
Reveal we thus our trust in Him,
Whose eyelids never slumber.
I ask, in parting, no long speech,
But while fond hands caress you,
I only ask the dear old words,
So sweet, so sad-- "God bless you!"
  I only ask the dear old words,
  So sweet, so sad-- "God bless you!"
