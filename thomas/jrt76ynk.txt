1. You nevver know what you can do, till you try, 
While plodding your journey, Oh bear this in mind, 
And if you will heed it you’ll “never say die,” 
Tho’ fortune should prove to you wayward and blind; 
Tho’ failure may come, to your ownself be true. 
A good heart will conquer tho’ stormy the sky, 
Have faith in yourself and then men will trust you, 
You never know what you can do, till you try, 
You never know what you can do, till you try.

 2. Be this then your motto, and all will be well, 
For if you should fall In attaining your end, 
You’ll always do something to help you to quell, 
The sorrow and gloom which misfortune attend; 
Remember the archer who aimed at the sun. 
Tho’ failing his mark yet his arrow sped high, 
So pause not in doubt when there’s work to be done, 
You never know what you can do, till you try, 
You never know what you can do, till you try.
