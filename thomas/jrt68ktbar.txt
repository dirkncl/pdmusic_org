1.
They've granted us a Candidate
That suits us to a man;
We've just a little while to wait
To spoil old Andy's play;
Those good old times will come again,
The Future skies are fair;
So let us go to work like men,
'Till Grant is in the chair.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So keep the ball a rolling, a rolling, a rolling,
O! keep it rolling onward evermore! (evermore!)
With Grant we'll soon be knocking, a knocking, a knocking,
A knocking at the Whitehouse door!

2.
That "Policy" is running out,
It needs a little rest;
But seems to me, one Policy--
Old Honesty's the best!
Columbia's true and faithful son
Shall to her arms repair;
There's nat a _Chase_ but we'll outrun
'Till Grant is in the chair.

3.
O! firmly shall the States be wed,
And those who say we'll fall,
When Grant is at the Nation's head
Will tell another tale!
That "drinking" yarn is mighty tough,
A party trick and snare,
They'll take their "bitters" enough,
When Grant is in the chair.

4.
We've got a noble work to do,
But ev'rything is bright,
And boys in blue, we count on you
To help us in the fight!
So don't forget the countersifn,
But in our vie'try share;
"We'll fight it out upon this line,"
'Till Grant is in the chair.
