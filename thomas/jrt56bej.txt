1. 
  O! the days of long ago,
  When my heart's unclouded glow,
Shed its radiance o'er my pathway, like the springtime fresh and bright;
  When I floated down life's stream,
  In a calm and pleasant dream,
And the light that shone around me then, was love's own light;
  When hand in hand I strayed,
  With a young and rosy maid,
O'er the hill side, through the meadow, and the daisy cover'd glen;
  And with many a garland fair,
  I entwined her flowing hair,
Sweet Jeannie, blue-eyed Jenny, I shall see ne'er again.

2. 
  O! those happy, happy days,
  When I tuned my careless lays,
And fondly deemed that life was on long summer-time of love,
  They will never come again;
  And no more through brake and glen,
With Jeannie, blue-eyed Jeannie, as of old shall I rove.
  Though my dream of life is past,
  Like a cloud before the blast;
I would not if I could, forget those happy days of yore;
  And she with whom I strayed,
  That young and rosy maid,
Sweet Jennie, still I love her, though I see her no more.
