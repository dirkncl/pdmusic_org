1. Nearest and dearest; oh! tell me once more, 
Am I remember’d and lov’d as of yore? 
Am I still dearer and more as thine own, 
Since thou hast taught me to love thee alone? 
Many the hopes I have cherish’d for thee— 
Tell me if nearest thy heart I shall be; 
Say if for me tender memories twine 
In the fond heart that should ever be mine. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Nearest and dearest; 
Oh! tell me once more,— 
Am I remember’d and lov’d as of yore?

2. Nearest and dearest; oh! tell me again, 
All my bright visions of love are not vain. 
Pleasure and hopes, o’er my sorrows and fears; 
Happily smile thro’ the far distant years. 
When I look up in the stargleaming air, 
Emblems of constancy smile on me there, 
O, to my spirit breathe lovingly new, 
Nearest and dearest and fairest art thou.
