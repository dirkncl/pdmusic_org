1. All the world is our home, the Philosophers say,
'Tis too large, though the wise men were right,
But for you and for me, we will no longer stray,
We are home we are home friends to night.
O! the sad lonely exile, who wanders for years,
Often fancies in dreams of delight,
That he hears the lov'd tones that once fell on his ears,
Softly syllable, home love to night,
Home love we'er home love to night!

2. Now away with the fetters that hamper'd us round,
With the glare that bewilder'd our sight,
O! be silenc'd each siren, each love-mocking sound,
We are home, we are home friends to night,
We may laugh, we may sing, for no critic is near,
None to darken or dim the home light,
Then away with each doubt, and with chilling fear,
For we're home, we are home friends to night,
Home, friends, we're home friends to night.
