1. Oh! must we part! how sad the words
Are falling on my heart!
Your beaming eyes would bid me stay,
Then dear one must we part?
And yet the words of hope you breath,
Have born away my pain,
I bless the lips that sweetly say,
"Good bye, but come again;
Good bye, good bye,
Good bye, but come again!

2. What bliss to hold you hand in mine,
And gaze within your eyes,
What bliss to know one heart is true,
'Neath fair or clouded skies;
Your loving words, like summer flow'rs,
Shall in my soul remain,
And soon I'll press the lips that say,
"Good bye, but come again;
Good bye, good bye,
Good bye, but come again!
