1. Those bright blue eyes, those bright blue eyes, 
Before whose liquid ray 
The dark sad cloud of mem’ry flies 
And sorrow melts away! 
How sweet I linger life along, 
My heart regains its youth 
Beholding lips, the fount of song, 
And breast the home of truth, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Ah! 
And those bright eyes, those bright blue eyes, 
Before whose liquid ray 
The dark sad cloud of mem’ry flies 
And sorrow melts away.

2. Those bright blue eyes, yes, those bright eyes 
That soul inspiring smile, 
Those lips that shame the rose’s dyes 
That heart which knows no guile; 
How blest with thee thro’ life to rove 
What e’er its path may be, 
Oh, give me but the light of love, 
And ’twill be Heav’n to me.
