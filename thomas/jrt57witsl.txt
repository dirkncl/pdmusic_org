1. Where is the sunny land, 
That I beheld of yore! 
With its lucid waves and its golden strand 
And its bright and dreamy shore, 
And its bright and dreamy shore. 
Where happy hearts in a joyous band 
Love on for ever more, 
Love on for ever more, 
Love on for ever more! 
Where is that sunny land, 
Where is that sunny land? 

2. Alas! for the dreams of youth! 
We seek their issue here, 
They are but the far off gleams of truth 
From heav’n’s unclouded sphere, 
From heav’n’s unclouded sphere. 
That region fair of eternal youth 
Unknown to sigh or tear, 
Unknown to sigh or tear, 
Unknown to sigh or tear! 
I long for that sunny land, 
I long for that sunny land!
