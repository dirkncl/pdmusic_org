1. When wand’ring feet have weary grown, 
And clouds make dim our way; 
When all my dearest hopes are flown, 
And darkly looms the day; 
The blest assurance O! how sweet, 
Amid this world of dross, 
Where ever stray our weary feet. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
“No crown without the cross!” 
“No crown, No crown without  the cross!”

2. Oh! gentle balm for ev’ry grief, 
Oh! fountain of our love! 
Here may my spirit find relief 
While in the gloom I rove. 
Lo! softly falls upon my ear, 
Amid my pain and loss, 
The watchword quelling ev’ry fear.

3. So bear thy burden, weary one, 
The toll will soon be o’er; 
Thy longing eyes— their weeping done— 
Shall see the golden shore! 
Now fair the blessing after pain! 
The gain for ev’ry loss! 
In life and death, in sun and rain.
