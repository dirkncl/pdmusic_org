1.
Wad ye hae me tell to you
What he whisper'd Jamie true
We were comin' down the brae
In the gloamin' Sweet of May.
Trembin', lean in' close to hear,
Thus he whisper'd in mine ear.
Ah! I maunna tell to you,
Maunna, maunna tell to you
Ah! I maunna tell to you
What he whisper'd Jamie true.

2.
Down the brae and through the glen
Lang we wander'd well I ken
Birds sang sweetly a' the morn
'Man the blossoms o' the thorn
Then he softly took my hand
Bendin' low to whisper an'
Ah! I maunna tell to you
Maunna maunna tell to you
Ah! I maunna tell to you
What a rosy lip mas do.
