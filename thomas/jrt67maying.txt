1. 
Come away! the rosy morning 
Breaks above the hill; 
Happy birds with merry music 
All the silence fill. 
Down the lane the winds are calling 
Where the poplars lean, 
All their slender tops  totether 
Robed in faintest green, 
Robed in faintest green.

2. 
Come away! the waters whisper 
Singing as they pass; 
Where the cowslip buds are shining 
In the meadow grass. 
In the woods the Mayflowers cluster 
Round our roving feet, 
Deep in leafy hollows hiding 
Half their dainties sweet, 
Half their dainties sweet.

3. 
Come away! when spring is waking 
Bird and flower and bee; 
Earth is full of happy voices 
Calling you and me: 
“Heart be glad! when storms are over 
Comes a brighter day, 
And the dreary hours of winter 
Blossom into May, 
Blossom into May!”
