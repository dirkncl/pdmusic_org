1.
Linger not darling, awake from thy sleep,
Sweetly the star of Love shines o'er the deep;
Fairy wing'd zephyrs have gone to their rest,
Kissing good night in the birds in their nest,
Wake from thy radiant dreams of delight,
Fairest of gems on the brow of the night.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Linger not darling I've something to tell,
Under the leaves in the shadowy dell,
Under the leaves in the shadowy dell.

CHORUS. ad lib. [sung after each REFRAIN]
Linger not darling I've something to tell,
Under the leaves in the shadowy dell,
Under the leaves in the shadowy dell.

2.
Linger not darling, the glimmering sea,
Sings of thy beauty in low melody;
Roses and lilies are smiling in dreams,
Softly is heard the light step of the streams,
Why art thou slumb'ring, every thing fair,
Revels tonight in the silvery air.
