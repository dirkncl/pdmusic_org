1. The summer is over and gone
When down by the slope of the hill
Our dear Kitty Clyde used to wander beside
The streamlet that ran by the mill.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Alas for the years that have gone
And taken our Kitty away
  The eyes that were bright
  And the heart that was light
Are deep in the cold, cold clay.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Alas for the years that have gone
And taken our Kitty away
  The eyes that were bright
  And the heart that was light
Are deep in the cold, cold clay.

2. She fishes no more by the brook.
She wanders no more by the mill.
We seek her in vain she will never again
Be seen by the slope of the hill.

3. She drooped in her fair maiden prime
Endear'd to each heart and each eye
The song of the brook can be heard from the nook
Where her once blooming beauties now lie.
