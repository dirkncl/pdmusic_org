1. Do ye right and fear not
O! heed thy Lord's command;
This thy noble watchword
While foes around thee stand,
Terrors that have bound thee,
Endure but for a day;
Shadows that surround thee
O! soon shall pass away.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Do ye right and fear not!
In doubt and pain and loss,
Onward! thou shalt conquer,
Thou soldier of the cross!

2. Doubts will fly before thee,
And O! the sweet relief;
Simple trust will give thee,
In all thy care and grief!
Lo! the end is wearing,
O! he then faithful still;
Life or Death unfearing,
Since thou hast done His will!
