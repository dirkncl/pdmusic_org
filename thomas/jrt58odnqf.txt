1. Oh, do not quite forget me, 
Nor the spot where last we met, 
That bonnie trysting spot of old, 
Oh! do not quite forget; 
When the silent stars are keeping 
Their lonely watch at night, 
When the pale sweet flow’rs are weeping, 
’Neath the cold and misty light. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh, do not quite forget me, 
Nor the spot where last we met, 
That bonnie trysting spot of old, 
Oh, do not quite forget.

2. Tho’ all the rest forget me, 
My own lov’d bonnie dear, 
Oh, say thou’lt sometimes think of me, 
Tho’ gayer ones are near; 
When round the cheerful hearth love, 
Light-hearted friends are met, 
When all around is mirth love, 
Oh, do not quite forget.
