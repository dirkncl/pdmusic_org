1. Dreaming, still dreaming, of days that are past,
Flow'rs that have faded, too lovely to last;
Sweet is the vision that greets me again,
Cheering my sorrow and soothing my pain.
Childhood's endearments and innocent wiles,
Passionate longings and love-lighted smiles;
Dreaming, still dreaming, while life glides away,
Visions of glory, bright, bright as the May!

2. Dreaming, still dreaming, while hopes that were fair
Fade like the snowdrift when Spring gilds the air;
Dreaming, still dreaming, though life's dawning rose
Dies like the radiance at daylight's repose.
Come to me, echoes of joys that are gone,
Come to my bosom, so weary and lone!
Dreaming, still dreaming, in sunlight and rain,
Life is but dreaming, still dreaming in vain!
