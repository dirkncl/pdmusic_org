1. I ask not a home in the mansion of pride 
Where marble shines out in the pillars and walls 
Though the roof be of gold it is brilliantly cold 
And joy may not dwell in its torch lighted halls. 
But seek for a bosom all honest and true 
Where love once awaken’d will never depart 
Turn, turn to that breast like the dove to its nest 
And you’ll find there’s no home like a home in the heart, 
You’ll find there’s no home like a home in the heart.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
A home in the heart, a home in the heart, 
You’ll find there’s no home like a home in the heart.

2. Oh link but on spirit that’s warmly sincere 
That will heighten your pleasure and solace your care 
Find a soul you may trust as the kind and the just 
And be sure the wide world holds no treasure so rare. 
Then the pains of misfortune may shadow our lot 
The cheek-scaring teardrops of sorrow may start 
But a star never dims sheds a halo for him 
Who can turn for repose to a home in the heart, 
Who can turn for repose to a home in the heart.
