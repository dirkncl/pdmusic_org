1. Ye sons and daughters of the Lord! 
The King of glory, King adored, 
This day Himself from death restored, 
Hallelujah! 
On Sunday morn, at break of day, 
The faithful women went their way 
To see the tomb where Jesus lay, 
Hallelujah!

2. Then straightway one in white they see,
Who saith, “ye seek the Lord, but He
Is risen and gone to Galilee,”
Hallelujah!
That night the Apostles met in fear,
But Christ did in their midst appear,
“My peace,“ He said, “be on all here!”
Hallelujah!

3. When Thomas first these tidings heard,
He doubted if it were the Lord,
Until He came and spake the word,—
Hallelujah!
“Behold my side, O Thomas, see!
My hands, My feet, I show to thee,
Not faithless, but believing be,”
Hallelujah!

4. When Thomas saw the wounded side,
The truth no longer he denied;
Thou art my Lord and God! he cried.
Hallelujah!
How blest are they who have not seen,
And yet whose faith hath constant been,
For the eternal life shall win,
Hallelujah!
