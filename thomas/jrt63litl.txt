1.
The sun was going down to rest,
Behind the woody hill;
The she was all in crimson drest,
And silent was the mill;
Upon the breeze a gentle sound
Was wafted o'er the plain,
And soon with fairy step and bound,
Came Lottie down the lane.

Came Lottie down the lane.
Lottie down the lane.
Lottie, Lottie,
Came Lottie down the lane.

2.
The curls beneath her dainty hood,
Came peeping to the light;
They were like golden buds, that would
In beauty take their flight;
Her snowy arm she placed in mine,
And past the fields of grain,
I wandered in a dream divine,
With Lottie in the lane.

With Lottie to the lane.
Lottie to the lane.
Lottie, Lottie,
Sweet Lottie in the lane.

3.
I see her face before me now,
In youthful glow and pride;
I kiss again her modest brow,
And linger by her side;
Her smiles near where-e'er I rove;
And when each hope shall wane,
I'll bless eve I won my love,
Sweet Lottie in the lane.

Sweet Lottie in the lane.
Lottie in the lane.
Lottie, Lottie,
Sweet Lottie in the lane.
