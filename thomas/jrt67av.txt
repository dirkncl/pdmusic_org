1. Angel voices sweeetly calling,
Come to cheer me day by day,
Round my pathway gently falling,
Whispers of the "far away!"
Lovely visions ever thronging,
Faces in their youthful glow,
Stir my heart with earnest longing,
Wake the dreams of long ago.

CHORUS ad lib. [sung after each verse]
Angel voices sweetly calling,
Leave me not while here I stray,
Round my pathway gently falling,
Guide me, cheer me, day by day!

2. Angel voices growing nearer,
As the golden sands depart!
Ever falling sweeter, dearer,
Whisper hope to ev'ry heart!
Come when stars of night are beaming,
Tell us of the radiant shore;
Come when morning dews are gleaming,
Tell of those who toil no more!
