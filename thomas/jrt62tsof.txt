1. See! the Standard of Freedom floats proudly on high; 
’Tis the bright waving banner of light— 
Fair symbol of Liberty, born of the sky— 
True emblem of Union and might! 
When our forefathers first, ’mid the clangor of strife, 
The Star-spangled Banner unfurl’d; 
’Twas babtiz’d with their blood, as sprang forth into life, 
A new nation, the hope of the world! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
See! the Standard of Freedom floats proudly on high: 
’Tis the bright waving banner of light— 
Fair symbol of Liberty, born of the sky— 
True emblem of Union and might!

2. When the patriot views that bright banner, each star 
In his bosom such ardor inspires, 
That he fears not the foe, nor the terrors of war, 
As he treads in the steps of his sires. 
Ay! the Freedom they won, ever dear to his heart, 
He will swear to protect with his arm; 
And from pen, loom or plough, like a hero, depart, 
When the trumpet shall sound an alarm!

3. Yet, may Peace and its blessings with Liberty blend, 
And be always the lot of one land; 
And may Plenty forever on Labor attend— 
Precious gift of a Bountiful Hand! 
Let the star of our empire be ever a guide 
To the pilgrim from over the sea; 
And the flag of our fathers the glory and pride 
Of a nation united and free!
