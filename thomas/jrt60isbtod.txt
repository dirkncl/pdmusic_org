1.
It seems but the other day to me,
When we together stray'd,
As children in the wildwood free,
Beneath its leafy shade;
And yet how many years have past,
Since life's springtime, away
Gone like a dream, too bright to last,
Dispell'd by the coming day!

2.
It seems but the other day to me,
I claim'd thee as my bride,--
Yet, children climb _our_ dear child's knee,
Like thee, thy mother's pride;
But thy dear love is still the same,
Tho' other joys depart,
And therefore time, I will not blame:
If it leaves me thy fond heart.
