1. All's for the best! be sanguine and cheerful;
Trouble and sorrow are friends in disguise;
Nothing but folly goes faithless and fearful;
Courage for ever! is happy and wise.
All's for the best! if a man would but know it,
Providence wishes that all may be blest,
This is no dream of the pundit or poet,
Fact is not fancy--and all's for the best!
  Fact is not fancy--and all's for the best!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
All's for the best!
All's for the best!
Fact is not fancy,
And all's for the best!

2. All's for the best! set this on your standard,
Soldier of sadness or pilgrim of love,
Who to the shores of despari may have wander'd
A way-wearied awallow or heart-stricken dove.
All's for the best! be a man but confiding
Providence tenderly governs the rest,
And the frail bark of his creature is guiding,
Wisely and warily all's for the best!
  Wisely and warily all's for the best!

3. All's for the best, dispel idle terrors,
Meet all you foes and your fears in the van
And in the midst of your dangers and errors
Trust like a child, and strive like a man.
All's for the best! unfailing, unbounded,
Providence wishes that all may be blest,
And both by wisdom and mercy surrounded,
Hope and be happy, then all's for the best!
  Hope and be happy, then all's for the best!
