1. We were boys and girls together, 
In that happy, happy time, 
When the spirit’s light shone brightest, 
And the heart was in its prime; 
Ere the morning light was clouded, 
That beam’d upon our youth, 
And the chill of worldly knowledge 
Had blighted childhood’s truth, 
And the chill of worldly knowledge 
Had blighted childhood’s truth. 
[REFRAIN]
We were boys and girls together, 
In that happy, happy time, 
When the spirit’s light shone brighter, 
And the heart was in its prime.

2. We were boys and girls together, 
When the step was firm and light, 
When the voice was clear and singing, 
And the laughing eyes were bright; 
Then our love sought no concealment, 
And our bosom’s knew no art, 
And the sunshine of our childhood 
Cast no shadow on the heart, 
And the sunshine of our childhood 
Cast no shadow on the heart. 
[REFRAIN]
We were boys and girls together, 
When the step was firm and light, 
When the voice was clear and ringing, 
And the laughing eyes were bright.
