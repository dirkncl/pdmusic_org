1. Oh, would that we had never met,
Oh, would that we had never lov'd!
Then I had never known regret
Nor she unfaithful proved;

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
But now 'tis past and ne'er again
Shall love enthrall me with its chain,
'Tis past and I have lov'd in vain--
False-hearted one, farewell!
  'Tis past and I have lov'd in vain--
  False-hearted one, farewell!

2. So false and yet so fair to see,
Her dreamlike beauty haunts me yet,
And tho' she now be dead to me,
I cannot all forget;
