1. Come again, happy days!
Come again to my heart as of old!
Gently fall, sunny rays,
Bring again ev'ry joy ye have told!
Bloom around, summer vales,
Where I played in my hope and my pride;
Fondly breathe, dewy gales,
Fondly breathe o'er the flow'rs at my side.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Come again, happy days!
Come again to my heart as of old!
Gently fall, sunny rays,
Bring again ev'ry joy ye have told!

2. Brightly shine, merry face,
Darling one I am dreaming of you!
Present joys ne'er replace
Kindly hands, kindly hearts that were true!
Sweet and low, like a bell
Softly swung in the depths of the sun,
Ever more fondly tell
All the dreams of the past unto me.
