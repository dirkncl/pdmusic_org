   A young soldier who was severely wounded at the Battle of
Antietam, lay in one of the hospitals at Frederick.  A Surgeon
passing by his bed side and seeing his boyish face lighted up
with a peaceful smile, asked him how he felt.  “Oh! I am happy
and contented now,” the soldier replied, “Last night Mother
kissed me in my dream!”

1. Lying on my dying bed, 
Thro’ the dark and silent night, 
Praying for the coming day; 
Came a vision to my sight; 
Near me stood  the forms I lov’d 
In the sunlight’s mellow gleam, 
Folding me unto her breast— 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Mother kiss’d me in my dream! 
Mother, Mother, 
Mother kiss’d me in my dream!

2. Comrades, tell her when you write
That I did my duty well,—
Say that when the battle rag’d
Fighting in the van I fell;
Tell her too, when on my bed,
Slowly ebb’d my being’s stream,
How I knew no peace until

3. Once again I long to see
Home and kindred far away,
But, I feel I shall be gone,
Ere there dawns another day;
Hopefully I bide the hour
When will fade life’s feeble beam,
Ev’ry pang has left me now—
