1. 
Fling high the Union banner! 
There’s life within the land; 
Around our chief we’ll gather, 
A true and loyal band! 
For freedom’s noble champion 
We’ll give our heart and voice; 
For he who sav’d the nation 
Shall be the Nation’s choice!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then rally round the banner, 
Good men of ev’ry station, 
For Victory and U. S. G. 
The man who sav’d the Nation!

2. 
O! give us peace and concord; 
Let this our motto be; 
The land is in commotion, 
We’ll calm the troubled sea. 
This war of “Reconstruction,” 
For evermore shall come; 
The man who sav’d the nation 
Shall give the Nation Peace!

3. 
“Good bye” to Ancient Veto, 
That patriotic son!
“A swinging round the circle,” 
Right homeward let him run! 
Extend the realms of Freedom! 
We’ll end this fuss and rant; 
We’ve got a cold Alaska, 
We’ll have a warmer Grant!
