1. Coldly comes the March wind, 
Coldly from the north, 
Yet the cottage little ones 
Gaily venture forth; 
Free from cloud the firmament, 
Free from sorrow they 
The playful children choosing 
The sunny side the way. 
The playful children choosing 
The sunny side the way.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
The sunny, the sunny, the sunny side the way.
The sunny, the sunny, the sunny side the way.

2. Sadly sighs the north wind 
Naked boughs among 
Like a tale of mournfulness 
Told in mournful song! 
But the merry little ones, 
Happy things are they 
Springing like the lark on 
The sunny side the way. 
Springing like the lark on 
The sunny side the way.

3. There the silv’ry snowdrop 
Daffodils like gold, 
Primroses and crocusses 
Cheerfully unfold; 
Poor? those cottage little ones 
Poor? no rich are they 
With their shining trea sures on 
The sunny side the way. 
With their shining treasures on 
The sunny side the way. 

4. Coldly oft the winds blow  
On the way of life 
Spreading in the wilderness 
Care and pain and strife; 
Yet the heart may shelter have 
Cold tho’ be the day 
Choosing like the lit tle ones 
The sunny side the way. 
Choosing like the little ones 
The sunny side the way.
