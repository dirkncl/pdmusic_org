1.
Oh farewell, farewell for ever,
We shall never meet again;
Love's bright chain which now we sever,
Ever broken must remain.
All the vows once fondly plighted!
Back to thee I now restore,
Thou my heart's best love has slighted,
And I'll dream of thee no more,
Thou my heart's best love hast slighted,
And I'll dream of thee no more,
Thou my heart's best love hast slighted,
And I'll dream of thee no more.

2.
Then farewell, farewell for ever!
I ne'er thought we _thus_ should part;
Oh farewell! and may'st thou never
Feel the pangs that wring my heart,
Other hearts will soon surround thee,
But for me all hope is o'er,
Thou hast broke the spell that bound me,
And I'll dream of thee no more,
Thou hast broke the spell that bound me,
And I'll dream of thee no more,
Thou hast broke the spell that bound me,
And I'll dream of thee no more.
