1. One by one the sands are flowing 
One by one the moments fall; 
Some are coming, some are going, 
Do not strive to grasp them all. 
One by one thy duties call thee, 
Let thy whole strength go to each; 
Let not future dreams elate thee, 
Learn thou first what these can teach; 
Learn thou first what these can teach.

2. One by one bright gifts from heaven 
Joys are sent thee here below, 
Take them readily when given, 
Ready too to let them go. 
Do not look at life long sorrow, 
See how small each moment’s pain; 
God will keep thee for tomorrow, 
So each day begin again; 
So each day begin again.
