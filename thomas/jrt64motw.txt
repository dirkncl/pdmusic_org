1. 
Once, in days departed, 
Dwell a lovely maid, 
Pure and simplehearted, 
In the forest shade. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Mary of the wildwood, 
Birdling blithe and free, 
Angel of my childhood,— 
Still I dream of thee!

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Mary of the wildwood, 
Birdling blithe and free, 
Angel of my childhood,— 
Still I dream of thee!

2. 
Hair of golden brightness, 
Cheeks of roseate hue, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, 
Eyes of tender blue. 

3. 
Earth is ever weeping: 
“All that’s bright must fade;” 
She I lov’d is sleeping 
In the forest shade.
