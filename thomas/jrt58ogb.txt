1. Oh! gently breathe the tender sigh, 
Which fell so sweetly on mine ear; 
And let thy soft and beaming eye. 
Again be radient with a tear. 
I’d rather hear that mournful sound 
And see that drop so pearly fine, 
Than list to thy most mirthful round, 
Or view thine eye with rapture shine.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Then gently breathe the tender sigh, 
Which found a ling’ring (an) echo near, 
And let thy blue and beaming eye, 
Again be soften’d by a (tear, yes, by a) tear.

2. THey speak of fond affection’s sway 
O’er all thy pure conffiding breast; 
They fell that passions far away, 
Nor mars thy peace, nor breaks thy rest. 
To me they are more pleasing still 
Than gayer sight or merrier sound, 
For do they not a tale reveal, 
Of love requited and return’d
