            _Life too Short for Strife.-_  Charles Dickens
relates the following of Douglas Jerrold: 
  Of his generosity I had a proof within these two or three
years, which it saddens me to think of now.  There had been
estrangement between us,_ not on any personal subject, and not
involving angry words,- and a good many months had passed
without my ever seeing him in the streets, when it fell out that
we dined, each with his own separate party, in the Stranger's
Room of the Club.  Our chairs were almost back to back, and I
took mine after he was seated and at dinner (I am sorry to
remember) and did not look that way.  Before we had sat long, he
openly wheeled his chair round, stretched out both hands in an
engaging manner, and said aloud, with a bright and loving face,
that I can see as I write you, "Let us be friends again. A life
is not long enough for this!"

1.
Come, place in mine an honest hand,
And heart to hand, we'll banish strife!
Let hate and wrath fly reason's wand,--
For ah! my friend, how brief is life!
Forget the follies of the past,
Forgive thy friend, each thoughtless pain,
And while our time on earth doth last;
Let us be friends, firm friends again!
Let's be friends,
Let's be friends, firm friends again!

2.
"Let not the sung go darkly down
Upon thy wrath"! are kind words giv'n
By One, whose brow ne'er knew a frown,
To guide our falt'ring steps to heav'n;
Then place in mine an honest hand,
Forgive thy friend each thoughtless pain,
And e'er while reason sways her wand;
Let us be friends, true friends again!
Let's be friends,
Let's be friends, firm friends again!
