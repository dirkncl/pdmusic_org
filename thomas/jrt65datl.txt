1. O when the weary day has fled,
And the flow'rs are dreaming
Across the vale my heart is led,
Where a light is gleaming
Beside the leafy lane we meet
(Just beyond the mill is)
And there we pass the hours so sweet,
Dowm among the lilies.
Down among the lilies,
Down among the lilies,
'Tis there we pass the hours so sweet,
Down among the lilies.

2. Before the zephyr low and bland,
Woke the rose to win it,
She gave to me her gentle hand
And her heart was in it
Her sunny life is pure and free
As the purling rill is,
And oh our way will ever be
Down among the lilies.
Down among the lilies,
Down among the lilies,
And oh way will ever be,
Down among the lilies.
