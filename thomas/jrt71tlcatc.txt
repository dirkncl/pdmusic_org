1.
God bless the little church around the corner,
May holy angels guard its walls!
It breathes a lesson sweet of love and kindness,
The smile of heav'n about it falls!
Though still the creeds of human hearts may differ,
Yet Christian love shall here abide;
No heart that claims the need of soothing comfort,
Shall here in sorrow be denied!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
God bless the little church around the corner.
May holy angels guard its walls!
It breathes a lesson sweet of love and kindness,
The smile of heav'n about it falls!

2.
God bless the little church around the corner,
Whose kindly words of Hope and Praise
Have lifted up our hearts in their affliction,
And shown us faith's enduring rays!
A blessing fall upon its portals ever,
And Love and Joy illime it still!
All honor to the kindly hearth within it,
That nobly did his Master's will!
