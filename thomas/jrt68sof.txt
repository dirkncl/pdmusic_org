1. Friendship is the perfect living, 
Since it is of two in one: 
For we live not, if we love not, 
Or we love ourselves alone. 
Lightest sunshine leans on shadow, 
In its golden alchemy; 
And the starlit sky of even 
Shares its jewels with the sea.

2. So our grief, if we but share it, 
With a loving breast and true, 
Turns its stony weight of sorrow 
To a golden joy for two. 
Life is double; dust and spirit; 
Ever two, forever one: 
Walking in the slanting sunlight; 
Casting shades beyond the sun.

3. Doubled is the joy divided: 
Friendship is the arch complete— 
In the rainbow arch and prism, 
Where the rays of gladness meet; 
Meet and scatter, many colored, 
O’er the darkness of our way, 
Light and beauty and the promise 
Of tomorrow to today.
