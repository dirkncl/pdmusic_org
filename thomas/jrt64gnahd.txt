1. When glowing stars have sweetly told,
The parting hour is nigh,
And gentle hands our own enfold,
While sadness dims the eye;
Then loving lips repeat the words,
That fall like sunny beams,
And linger like the songs of birds
Good night and happy dreams.
Good night! (Good night!)
Good night! (Good night!)
Good night and happy dreams,
  Good night! (Good night!)
  Good night! (Good night!)
  Good night and happy dreams.

2. Oh long we linger by the door!
The fleeting hours we chide,
For when love fondly tell them o'er
On wings of light they glide;
The risy lips again we kiss,
Beneath the silver beams,
And bless the whisper'd words of kiss,
Good night and happy dreams.
Good night! (Good night!)
Good night! (Good night!)
Good night and happy dreams,
  Good night! (Good night!)
  Good night! (Good night!)
  Good night and happy dreams.
