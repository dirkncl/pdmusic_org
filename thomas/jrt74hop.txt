1. Hearer of pray’r, incline Thine ear, 
And list, oh, list to mine: 
Blot from  my heart all guilty fear, 
And claim  it wholly Thine! 
Make me but wise to do the right, 
And brave the wrong to flee,— 
Shed o’er my steps the glo  rious Light 
Which leads to Life and Thee.

2. Hearer of pray’r, forgive the past— 
Forgive each lifelong sin; 
’Cause my  resolve’s to firmly last 
Thro’ worldly strife and din! 
Shield me from all the snares of earth, 
From crime, and griefs, and pain; 
Prepare me for the Nobler Birth— 
Then I’ve not liv’d in vain.
