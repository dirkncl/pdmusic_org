1. Bright days are comeing, love,
Brighter, more dear;
Teardrops are falling, love,
Still they are clear;
Hast thou e'er seen, love,
The icelets of spray--
The colder the region,
The brighter are they!
And so in our sorrow,
The darker it loom,
The brighter tomorrow
Will shine thro' the gloom.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Bright days are coming, love,
Brighter for thee:
Bright days are coming, love,
Brighter for thee!

2. Bright days are coming, love,
Sorrow no more:
Fond dreams are passing, love,
Smile as before;
Bent tho' the flow'r be,
While storms rage around,
The richer its perfume
After is found!
Dark tho' the night-cloud,
Still clearer the star,
And brighter the sunbeam
That's breaking afar.
