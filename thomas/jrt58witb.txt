1. When in thy bosom the wrath has been kindled, 
Bear with thy wrong, not in anger defend, 
Turn not away from the crowd where you mingled, 
Leaving a foe where you sought for a friend; 
Speak not in anger but rather in sorrow, 
Part, and tho’ each take a different path, 
Both may be wiser and better tomorrow; 
Let not the sun go down on your wrath! 
Let not the sun go down on your wrath. 

2. What tho’ your prospects a moment seem blighted, 
Trusting to others— by others betray’d, 
There is not a wrong that can never be righted, 
Justice was never by quarelling made; 
Urge but the truth and be guided by reason, 
Leaving to others the opposite path, 
So will you triumph, but all in good season— 
Let not the sun go down on your wrath! 
Let not the sun go down on your wrath.
