1.
Oh, my love's a flow'r, surpassing
All others I have seen;
Tho' call o'er my dear old Erin
A rover I have been,
I ne'er yet beheld a blossom
So beautiful and fair,
As that lovely gem of nature,
Young Kathleen of Kildare.

2.
Oh, her eyes are like the morning,
When breaking softly bright;
Her lips like op'ning roses,
Her teeth are snowy white;
Her step is light and graceful,
Her brow beyond compare,
And rich dancing golden tresses,
Hath Kathleen of Kildare.

3.
Oh, the sun and moon for ever,
With all the stars may shine,
but they cannot beam, no, never,
On bliss surpassing mine,
When she fondly yielding whisper'd,
"Life's ills or joys to share,
I am thine, my Terance, darling!"
Sweet Kathleen of Kildare.
