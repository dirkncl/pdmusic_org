1.
You are not what you were Marie, when 'neath the old oak tree,
  I gathered flowers rare Marie, and you crown'd both Cort and me;
You never smile on my Marie, as once in days of yore,
  I miss you in the cottage home, you shun me on the shore,
'Tis very hard to linger thus, beneath our childhood's sky,
  And hear your naughty tongue say "no" while "yes" is in your eye,
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, you are so sad, and sigh?
  Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, you are so sad, and sigh?
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, Oh! won't you tell me why?

2.
I thought you'd live with me Marie, as hope once promised true,
  When walking in the woods Marie, with birds half hid from view;
But we must hie to Rome Marie, must cross the deep, deep sea,
  And if the ship must sink with you, let ocean swallow me.
But oh, you're dreaming now of Cort, of my you are so shy,
  Alas! how sad the Painter's fate, how briht the Poet's eye,
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, in sadness I must die,
  Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, in sadness I must die,
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, Oh! won't you tell me why?

3.
Now since I've lost my dear Marie, her portrait give to me,
  'Tis painted by myself Marie, oh! how like to thee!
I'll kiss it o'er and o'er Marie, while crossing o'er the sea!
  I'll kiss it on our native shore, beneath that old oak tree,
I'll look not on your Cort again, nor on you deep black eye,
  Thy angel smile bids Poets live thy sigh bids Painter die.
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, you bade the Painter die.
  Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, you bade the Painter die.
Oh! won't you tell me why Marie, Oh! won't you tell me why?
