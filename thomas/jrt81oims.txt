1. Oft in my slumbers sweet forms arise, 
Dear ones departed clasp me once more; 
Voices of angels borne from the skies, 
Joy to my bosom fondly restore 
Lips that were loving meet then my own; 
Hope in my pathway blooms like the rose; 
Tempests of sorrow, cares that I’ve known, 
Oft in my slumbers calmly repose.

CHORUS (ad lib.) [sung after each verse]
Tempest of sorrow, cares that I’ve known, 
Oft in my slumber calmly repose. 
Oft in my slumber calmly repose.

2. Oft in my slumbers childhood so bright 
Lingers around me pure as the morn; 
Home with its visions clad in delight, 
Wakes at my bidding life to adorn! 
Glimpses of beauty leave me no more, 
Life has no sorrow when ye appear! 
Tempests may darken, joys may be o’er 
Oft in my slumbers heaven is near!
