Praise the Lord, 
Praise the Lord, 
O my soul; and all that is within me, 
praise his holy Name, 
Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, 
O my sould, and forget not all his benefits. 
Who forgiveth all thy sin, 
and healeth all thine infirmities; 
Who saveth thy life, 
thy life from destruction, 
And crowneth thee with mercy, 
and loving kindness. 
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, 
Ye that excel in strength; 
Ye that fulfill his command ment, 
and hearken unto the voice of his word. 
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts; 
ye servants of his that do his pleasure. 
O speak good of the Lord, 
all ye works of his, 
in all places of his dominion, 
praise thou the Lord, O my soul. 
Glory be to the Father 
And to the Son 
And to the Holy Ghost; 
As it was in the beginning, 
is now and ever shall be, 
World without end, 
Amen, Amen, Amen.
