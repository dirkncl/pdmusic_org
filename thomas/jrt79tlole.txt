1. Blue eyed darling, kind  and true, 
Heart of summer and soul of May, 
Thou art ever with me through 
Darkest night and drearest day, 
Strife and toll and care may come. 
Cloud and storms before me rise. 
Still like stars through deepest gloom 
Beams the light of loving eyes. 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Eyes of blue, kind and true, 
Soft and clear as the fairest skies, 
Love itself find life anew 
In the light of loving eyes.

2. Over land or over sea 
In the wild or by the shore 
Loving eyes, thou art with me 
Guiding bright’ning ever more, 
Do I wake or do I dream, 
Still the soft, sweet light is near, 
And before its gentle beam 
All things joyless disappear.

3. Time may sprinkle gleams  of snow 
Over the sheen of golden hair, 
Age may stear the roses glow 
From full many a face that’s fair; 
But though cheeks grow pale, and care 
Turns to gray the locks of gold, 
One dear charm time still must spare— 
Loving eyes can ne’er grow old.
