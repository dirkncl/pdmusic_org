1. Oh what a world this might be, 
If hearts were always kind. 
If friendship, none would slight thee, 
And fortune prov’d less blind, 
With love’s own voice to guide us, 
Unchanging e’er and fond, 
With all we wish beside us, 
Andnot a care beyond. 

[REFRAIN]
Oh what a world this might be, 
More blest than that of yore, 
Come, learn, and ’twill requite ye 
To love each other more.

2. Oh what a world of beauty, 
A loving heart might plan, 
If man but did his duty, 
And help’d his brother man, 
Then angel guests would brighten, 
The threshold with their wings 
And love  divince enlighten, 
The old forgotten strings. 

[REFRAIN]
Oh what a world of beauty, 
A loving heart might plan, 
If man but did his duty 
And lov’d his brother man.
