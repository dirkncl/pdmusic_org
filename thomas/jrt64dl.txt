1. All the hours are cheerless when thy smile is gone,
Day not night hath gladness, as I roam alone,
Sadly, sadly pining for the happy past,
Visions that have faded, dreams too bright to last.
Dreamy murmurs coming from the distant shore,
All are sadly calling Darling Leonore.

2. But the angels wathing o'er our darling prize,
Claimed the gift from heaven, from the upper skies,
Bore her to the mansions of the blest above,
There to dwell in gladness, happiness and love.
Still there beams a promise, fading nevermore--
That we soon shall meet our Darling Leonore.
