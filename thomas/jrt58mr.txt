1. 
The eve is calm, the moon shines bright, 
While o’er the stream we row, 
And sweetly beam the stars of night 
With soft and lustrous glow; 
With oar  in hand we ply thy streams, 
And swift we glide along, 
While we hear on the distant air the echo of our song! 
of our song, of our song, of our song! 
Merrily row, cheerily row, 
And let our oars keep time, 
While o’er the tide we swiftly glide, 
In song our voices chime! 
In song, in song, in song our voices chime! 
In sung our voices chime! 
In song our voices chime!

2. 
Sweet and cool the breezes blow, 
Refreshing o’er the lea, 
And gaily o’er the moonlit stream 
Our boat she glides no free; 
Our voices chime, our oars keep time 
To th’harmonious strain, 
And far we go with steady row, 
And then return again! 
return again, return again, return again! 
Merrily row, cheerily row, 
And let your oars keep time, 
While o’er the tide we swiftly glide, 
In song our voices chime! 
In song, in song, 
In song our voices chime! 
In song, in song, 
In song! our voices chime! 
our voices chime, 
our voices chime, 
our voices chime!
