1. Golden hours of youth and pleasure,
Ye were soon to fade away!
In my heart I fondly treasure
All your joys that would not stay;
  All your joys that would not stay.
Life in beautiful completeness,
Eyes that shown like dewy flow'rs
Hopes that bloomed with loving sweetness,
All were yours, bright golden hours!
  Hopes that bloomed with loving sweetness,
  All were yours, bright golden hours!

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Bright golden hours!
Bright golden hours!

2. Golden hours we scarce may number
All your sweet and rare delight,
Ere within the Past ye slumber,
Leaving us in gloomy night,
  Leaving us in gloomy night.
Life no dearer boon has left us,
Though we roam mid fairy bow'rs.
When your splendors have bereft us,
Joy is gone, bright golden hours!
  When your splendors have bereft us,
  Joy is gone, bright golden hours!
