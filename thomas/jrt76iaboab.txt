1. There's a nate little isle in the ocean,
And it's dearly I'm lovin' that same!
Och! it causes the sweetest emotion
In my heart when I mention its name.
For it's there you'll see dancin' an' "waking,"
But the divil a care to annoy;
And it's whiskey you'll get for the taking,--
Take my word, I'm a broth of a boy!
  An' it's whiskey ye'll get for the taking,--
  Take my word, I'm a broth of a boy!

2.
There's a town in this isle they call Dublin,
And a gem of a place is that neme!
Oh! it's ladies my soul they are troublin'
For I see them each night in my drame,
But there's one, such a foine little maiden,
That I think of wid sighing an' joy;
To my neck just in love I am wadin',
For she says I'm a broth of a boy!
  To my neck just in love I am wadin',
  For she says I'm a broth of a boy!

3.
Don't I see now the cot an' the garden,
An' the pigs wid me own bles-sed eyes?
Oh! the heart in our bosom must harden,
Whin the land of our birth we despise!
Darlin' home, it's to see you I'm burnin,
An' my love time can never destroy;
Sure the girls they'll most ate me, returning,
For they know I'm a broth of a boy!
  Sure the girls they'll most ate me, returning,
  For they know I'm a broth of a boy!
