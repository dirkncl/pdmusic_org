[CLARA]
1. Oh! these men, these fickle men,
Let maidens all beware!
Scarcely true one day in ten,
Tho' love they all declare;
Ev'ry girl who passes by,
May bring them to her feet;
If she bears a sparkling eye,
And smile that's fair and sweet.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Oh! these men! Oh! these men!
Oh! Oh! these men!

2. Oh! these men, these cruel men!
They drive a body mad;
When they wed, why then,--why then--
They're sometimes quite as bad!
Don't believe them when they speak
Of constancy and love;
Soon the tears will dim your cheek,
You'll find they all will rove!
