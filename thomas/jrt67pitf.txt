1. On the rug before the grate, 
	In the ruddy light, 
Tired of play, the children wait, 
	Ere they say, “Good night!” 
Rosy grows each dimpled face, 
	As the flame leaps higher, 
While their busy fancies trace 
	Pictures in the fire,— 
While their busy fancies trace 
	Pictures in the fire.

2. Blossoms in whose glowing cup
	Shines the nectar dew,
Golden bees that drink it up,
	Birds of wondrous hue,—
Fairy troops, that faintl show
	Through a rosy haze,—
So the pictures come and go,
	In a shifting maze!
So the pictures come and go,
	In a shifting maze!


3. Slowly fade the changing dyes
	To a duller light;
Dreamy grow the children’s eyes,
	As they say, “Good night.”
Sweet good night! the angels keep
	Dreams for such as you,
And the pictured halls of sleep
	Shine with beauty new!
And the pictured halls of sleep
	Shine with beauty new!
