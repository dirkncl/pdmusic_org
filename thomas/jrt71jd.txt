O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands; 
Serve the Lord with gladness, 
Serve the Lord with gladness, 
and come before his presence with a song. 
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God, 
it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves; 
We are his people, 
We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
O go your ways in to his gates with thanksgiving 
And in to his courts with praise; 
Be thankful unto him, and speak good of his name. 
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is ever lasting; 
And his truth endureth from generation to generation. 
Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; 
As it was in the beginning, 
is now and ever shall be and ever shall be, 
World without end, Amen, Amen, Amen.
