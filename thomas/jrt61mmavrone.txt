1. 
Avourneen, I’m bothered beyond comprehension, 
By means of a vision I had in the night, 
A darling there came that I’m bashful to mention, 
Along in my dream like an angel of light. 
She was winsome and fair, 
With a mild graceful air 
And a form, I declare, made to charm like thine own. 
O! her smile sent a dart Like a flush to my heart, 
That was equal to murder, sweet Mollie Mavrone!

2. 
Through all my fond daydreams her image is stealing, 
Encircling with bliss all the thoughts that arise, 
Still flinging around me a rapturous feeling, 
And tickling my heart with the light of her eyes, 
Slowly gliding away, Like the bright light of day, 
And leaving me hopelessly pining alone 
To wrestle with love In this comfortless way, 
Withour one to help me, sweet Mollie Mavrone!

3. 
Her voice like the song of the waters when singing, 
The musical ripples at eve to repose, 
Came flooding my soul like some fairy lute ringing 
With notes soft and pure as the breath of the rose. 
I’d willingly barter A star of the garter 
To get this rare darling for bone of my bone, 
To lovingly woo her And fondly cling to her, 
While life’s in this bosom, sweet Mollie Mavrone!
