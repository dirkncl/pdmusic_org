1.
I could live in a desert, if only with thee.
I would watch o'er thee, guard thee, and love faithfully;
I would give up all pleasures, that wealth could bestow,
For the wealth of thy heart love, one moment to know.
I would bask in thy sunshine with soul full of glee,
And would float on life's waves like a bark on the sea;
Ev'ry moment on earth to companionship given,
Would seem like a cycle of love-bliss in Heav'n.
If with thee, if with thee I could live in a desert, if only with thee.

2.
I could live in a desert, if thou wert with me,
An oasis of love there forever would be;
I would quench at love's fountain, this thirst in my heart,
And would bathe in that joy which true lover's impart
What is wealth or high station or worldly repute,
But an Ocean of trouble and endless dispute
So like pilgrims we'll hie to some desert away
And live for each other Love's long summer day.
If with thee, if with thee I could live in a desert, if only with thee.
