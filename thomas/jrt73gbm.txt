[CHORUS]
God be merciful unto us and bless us, 
and show us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us;
That the way may be known upon earth,
thy saving health among all nations.

Let the people praise thee O God;
Yea let all people praise thee.

[SOLO for Bass]
O let the nations rejoice and be glad;
for Thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon the earth.

[CHORUS]
Let the people praise thee, O God;
Yes, let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase;
and God, ev'n our own God, shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us; and all
the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father,
And to the Son,
And to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning,
is now and ever shall be,
World without end,
Amen, Amen,
Amen.
