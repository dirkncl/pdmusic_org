Verse_Lyric: 1
1. We lov’d her as our own, poor child,
As thro’ the weary years.
We nurs’d her life with constant care,
And kiss’d her silent tears;
She strove to seem contented while
We cheer’d her thro’ the day,
But when alone at night, poor child,
She wept her life aawy.

Verse_Lyric: 2
2. We strove by ev’ry art, poor child,
By ev’ry tender art,
And ev’ry gentle means, to win
Her sorrow from her heart;
But still she droop’d beneath our care,
And sadder grew each day,—
Her cheek was always wet, poor child,
She wept her life away.

Chorus_Lyric: 1
1. She wept her life away,
She wept her life away,
But when alone at night, poor child,
She wept her life away.

Chorus_Lyric: 2
2. She wept her life away,
She wept her life away,
Her cheek was always wet, poor child,
She wept her life away.

Verse_Lyric: 3
3. Still while she wept and strove, poor child,
To pay our love with smiles,
And hide her sorrow from our hearts,
With sweet and playful wiles;
Her lip grew whiter and her cheek
Grew paler day by day,
And struggling with her grief, poor child,
She wept her life away.

Chorus_Lyric: 3
3. She wept her life away,
She wept her life away,
And struggling with her grief, poor child,
She wept her life away.

Verse_Lyric: 4
4. She died when summer came, poor child,
The child we could not save,
And hardly mourning that she slept,
We laid her in the grave;
She never could forget the day
Her sainted mother died,—
They could not live apart, poor child,
They slumber side by side.

Chorus_Lyric: 4
4. They slumber side by side,
They slumber side by side,—
They could not live apart, poor child,
They slumber side by side.
