1. Oft in the stilly night, 
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me, 
Fond mem’ry brings the light 
Of other days around me; 
The smiles, the tears, of childhood’s years, 
The words of love then spoken, 
The eyes that shone, now dimm’d and gone, 
The cheerful hearts now broken! 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Thus in the stilly night, 
Ere slumber’s chain has bound me, 
Sad mem’ry brings the light 
Of other days around me.

2. When I remember all 
The friends, so link’d together, 
I’ve seen around me fall, 
Like leaves in wintry weather; 
I feel like one who treads alone 
Some banquethall deserted, 
Whose lights are fled, whose garlands dead, 
And all but he departed!
