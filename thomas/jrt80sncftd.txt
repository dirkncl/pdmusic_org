1. We lov’d her as our own, poor child, 
As thro’ the weary years 
We nurs’d her life with constant care, 
And kiss’d her silent tears; 
She strove to seem contented while 
We cheer’d her thro’ the day, 
But when alone at night, poor child, 
She wept her life away. 

CHORUS 1
She wept her life away,  
She wept her life away, 
But when alone at night, poor child, 
She wept her life away.

2. We strove be ev’ry art, poor child,  
Be ev’ry tender art, 
And ev’ry gentle means, to win 
Her sorrow from her heart; 
But still she droop’d beneath our care, 
And sadder grew each day,— 
Her cheek was always wet, poor child, 
She wept her life away. 

CHORUS 2
She wept her life away,
She wept her life away.
Her cheek was always wet, poor child, 
She wept her life away.

3. Still while she wept and strove, poor child, 
To pay our love with smiles, 
And hide her sorrow from our hearts, 
With sweet and playful wiles; 
Her lip grew whiter and her cheek 
Grew paler day by day, 
And struggling with her grief, poor child, 
She wept her life away. 

CHORUS 3
She wept her life away,
She wept her life away.
And struggling with her grief, poor child, 
She wept her life away.

4. She died when summer came, poor child, 
The child we could not save, 
And hardly mourning that she slept, 
We laid her in the grave; 
She never could forget the day 
He sainted mother died,— 
They could not live apart, poor child, 
They slumber side by side. 

CHORUS 4
She wept her life away,
She wept her life away.
They could not live apart, porr child, 
They slumber side  by side.
