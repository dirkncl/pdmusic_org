CHORUS 1
Once more beneath the Lights 
That rule our days and nights, 
We mingle on the corridors of Time; 
Once more our mystic band 
Prepare for Labors grand— 
Convening  in Fraternity sublime! 
Our faithful watch is set; 
And on the Level met, 
Our Labor and our Mystery we share 
Until the Gavel’s sound 
In Harmony profound 
Shall call us up, to part upon the Square. 

SOLO
Grand Master supernal! 
Grand Master eternal! 
To Thee! only Thee! 
Our devotion we render; 
To Thee! only Thee! 
Our ovation we tender; 
From temple and shrine 
All praises are Thine 
All praises are Thine! 
Grand Master supernal 
Grand Master eternal! 
Enthron’d on the Arches, 
Enthron’d on the Arches, 
Enthron’d on the Arches, the Arches divine!

CHORUS 2
O! pure immortal Art, 
That in each Mason’s heart 
The Ashlar of his destiny conceals; 
Ye mysteries of mind 
By ancient lore design’d, 
And only on the Trestleboard reveal’d; 
O! be it ours to rear 
Beneath our Arches here, 
The beauty and perfection of each shaft; 
Until on high, at length, 
Establish’d in its strength, 
We consecrate the Temple of our Craft!
