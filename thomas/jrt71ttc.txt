1. No wreath of roses dewy sweet 
Shall lie before your wand’ring feet! 
Your way must be thro’ pain and loss, 
If ye would bear your Saviour’s cross! 
For dark and narrow is the way 
That leads to realms of perfect day! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then falter not, tho’ eyes grow dim,— 
Bear ye the cross that leads to Him! 
Bear ye the cross that leads to Him!

2. True cross that bears no flow’rs to cheer; 
O, weary burden dark and drear! 
Yet sweet the blessing while ye rove, 
Your Saviour’s pure and precious love! 
Like balm it soothes the weary soul 
While round the stormy billows roll!         

3. Tho’ earthly hopes that cheer’d your way 
In tears and anguish die today; 
Tho’ hearts ye love, the good, the tried, 
No longer linger by your side, 
Ye know the Heav’nly Crown is won, 
Thro’ paths which bear no flow’rs nor sun!
