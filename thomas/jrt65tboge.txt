1. Wid all condecinshin, 
I'd turn your attinshin,
To what I would menshin iv Erin so green;
An' widout hisitayshin, 
I'd show how that nayshin
Became to creyashin the gim and the queen.
It happen'd one mornin',
Widout iny warnin',
That Vaynus was born in the beautiful say,
An' be that same tokin,
An' sure 'twas provokin,
Her pinions were soakin', an' wudnt give play.

2. So Niptune who knew her,
Began to pursue her,
In ordher to woo her, the wicked old jew,
An' he very nigh caught her
Atop iv the wather,
Great Jupiter's daughter, who cried Poo ta to!
But Jove, the great jaynious,
Look'd down an' saw Vaynus,
And Niptune so hanious purshuin her wild,
So he roar'd out in thundher;
He'd tear him asunder,
An' sure 'twas no wondher for tazin his child.

3. So a star that was flyin'
Around him, espyin',
He sazed widout sighin and burl'd it below,
Where it tumbled like winkin',
On Niptune while sinkin',
An' gave him I'm thinkin', a broth in a blow.
An' that star was dhry land,
Both lowland and highland,
An' form'd a swate island, the land iv my birth;
Thus plain is the shtory
'Kase sint down from glory,
That Erin so hoary's a heaven on earth.

4. Then Vaynus jump'd nately,
On Erin so shtately,
But fainted, kase lately so bother'd an priss'd,
Which much did bewildher,
But ere it had kill'd her,
Her father dishtill'd her a dhrop iv the bisht.
An that glass so victorious,
It made her feel glorious,
A little uproarious I fear it might porve
Hince how can yez blame us
That Erin's so famous
For beauty, an' murther, an' whisky, an' love.
