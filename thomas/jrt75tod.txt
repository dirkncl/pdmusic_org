1. Just beyond the purple shadows, 
When the sunset glimmers fair; 
Fancy roams o’er golden meadows, 
Dreaming of the loved ones there.
Olden mem’ries come to bless us, 
And we stray to yonder shore; 
Gentle ones again caress us, 
Coming thro’ the open door! 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[Overlapping voices]
 [Soprano]
Hark! the sounds of endless gladness 
Echoed from the far off shore! 
 [Alto, Tenor, Bass]
Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark! 
Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark! 
Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark! 
Hark! Hark! Hark! Hark!
[SATB together]
Weary heart, awake from sadness, 
Yonder gleams the open open door! 

2. Little faces that departed, 
Dawn upon our raptured sight! 
Forms that left me brokenhearted, 
Linger near us with delight! 
Thus, at sunset, lovely fancies 
All our darling hopes restore; 
Bless the dear, the fitful glances 
Giv’n us thro’ the open door!
