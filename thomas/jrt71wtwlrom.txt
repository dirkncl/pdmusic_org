1. Tis only when the sad farewell 
And parting sigh around us fall, 
The heart can know and fondly tell, 
The worlds of love which they recall, 
But angel rays will cheer our gloom, 
And dying hope to life restore; 
They whisper “joys that fade will bloom, 
When those we love return once more,” 
return, return once more.

2. We gaze with fond and weeping eyes, 
While one by one their forms depart; 
We cull the flow’rs we know they prize. 
And press them to our lonely heart! 
The moment comes in visions sweet, 
And gems the future’s mystic shore, 
O hands and lips in rapture meet 
When those we love return once more, 
return, return once more.
