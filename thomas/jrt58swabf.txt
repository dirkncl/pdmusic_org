1. She was a beauteous flower, 
Just blushing into day, 
And nought in fields or bower 
Could e’er such charms display; 
But, blight o’ertook her early bloom 
Ere dawn of summer tide, 
And we laid her in the lonely tomb, 
Earth’s young and spotless bride— 
We laid her in the lonely tomb, 
Earth’s young and spotless bride! 

2. The fairest flow’rs must wither, 
They die— but not in vain, 
For when the spring comes hither, 
They rise to bloom again; 
And she, we lov’d, tho’ pass’d away 
And lost to mortal eyes, 
Now blossoms in Eternal day, 
A Flow’r of Paradise— 
Now blossoms in E­ternal day, 
A Flow’r of Paradise!
