[Charles]
Sweet Angel, take away your mask, and let me see your face;
You image in my inmost heart has found a dwelling place.
[Clara]
Your flatt'ry, like my face, good sir,
You'll find is very plain;
Then let me leave you, I protest,
I cannot here remain.
[Charles]
Oh! do not bid me here to sigh,
Oh! leave me not alone,
But hear my while I swear you are my only, only own!
[Clara]
How many maids, good sir, have heard the same before from you?
[Charles]
Not one! I swear this heart of mine will evermore be true.

[DUET] [repeat after verses 1 and 2]
[overlapping voices]
[Clara]
And can I trust you when I say
You'll evermore be true?
Oh! can I trust you when I say
You'll evermore be true?
[Charles]
Believe me when I say my heart
Will evermore be true?
Believe me when I say my heart
Will evermore be true?

[Clara]
Oh! what would people say, you know,
I've known you scarce an hour;
[Charles]
Quite long enough to hold my heart
In Cupid's magic pow'r.
[Clara]
A bird that's caught so easily,
Will never long remain;
[Charles]
Your words would keep me, ev'ry word's a link in Cupid's chain.
[Clara]
But ere I let you see my face,
A secret I will tell;
There is another in this world who loves me fondly well.
[Charles]
A rival sweet, I could not bear,
Does he possess your heart?
[Clara]
Well, once he did, but now I fear
Your rival must depart.

3.
[Clara]
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! 
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
I've caught you now at last!
Where are your pretty speeches, sir,
Can I forgive the past?
[Charles aside.]
What, Clara caught by all that's fair,
In trap so neatly set!
I'm dumb, and really do declare
Man ne'er fooled woman yet!
[Clara]
What have you got to say, pray tell? 
your tongue, sir, have you lost?
[Charles aside]
The game she knows, alas, too well,
My truth I cannot boast.
[Clara]
I followed you unto the ball,
Your shadow there was I.
[Charles]
But love if you'll forgive me all,
Your Charles I'll live and die!

[DUET] [overlapping voices]
[Clara]
Oh, should I now forgive you all,
Mine will you live and die?
Oh, should I now forgive you all,
Mine will you live and die?
[Charles]
But, love, if you'll forgive us all,
Your Charles I'll live and die!
But, love, if you'll forgive us all,
Your Charles I'll live and die!
