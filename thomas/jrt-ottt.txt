1. Oh! take this token to thy heart. 
Tho’ poor and slight its worth may be, 
And promise ne’er from it to part, 
For bygone memories, old memories of me. 
Ah! could we but recal the past, 
Those days gone never to return 
When by a spell then o’er us cast 
Our vows were broken, And I’m left to mourn. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Then take this token to thy heart 
Tho’ poor and slight its worth may be. 
And promise ne’er from it to part 
For bygone memories of me.

2. The stream we sat by still glides on. 
Our fav’rite trees are now in bloom, 
All nature smiles and ev’ry one 
Is gay, while my poor aching heart is fill’d with gloom. 
The bird’s notes have no power to cheer. 
The bright sun lightens not my grief 
And then I linger on from year to year, 
Till in the grave at last I find relief.
