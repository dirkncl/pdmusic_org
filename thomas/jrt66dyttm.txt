1. Do you think the moon could have seen us,
As we stood with your white hand in mine,
And the words that you uttered so softly
Seem'd to me like a whisper divine;
Did you think when the time came for parting
And we wonder'd the hour was so late,
There was any one near us to hear you,
When you kiss'd me last night by the gate.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
There was somebody near us 'to hear us,
There was somebody out just as late;
For the whisper went by in the moonlight,
That you kissed me last night by the gate.

2. There was Katy-Dids hid in the willow,
And they must have heard all of our talk,
And the love words uttered so softly
Must have gone up to them from the walk;
For one said "you did," while another
Cried "you didn't," all thro' the long night,
While I thought as I went thro' the moonlight
If you did, you at least had a right.

3. In the years that are coming my darling,
We need care not tho' early or late,
Other Katy-Dids keep up the story
As to what was done down by the gate;
And the moon can betray us no longer,
Tho' beneath it, my coming you you wait,
For [oy?] right of the ring on your finger
you can kiss me again at the gate.
