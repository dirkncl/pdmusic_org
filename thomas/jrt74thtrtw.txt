1. Blessings on the hand of Woman!
Angels guard its strength and grace
In the palace, cottage, hovel,
O, no matter where the place!
Would that never storms assailed it;
Rainbows ever gently curled;

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
For the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rocks the world,
For the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rocks the world.

2. Infancy's the tender fountain;
Power may with Beauty flow;
Mothers first to guide the streamlets;
From them souls unresting grow.
Grow on for the good or evil,
Sunshine stream'd or darkness hurled;

3. Woman, how divine your mission
Here upon you natal sod!
Keep, O keep the child soul open
Always to the breath of God!
All true trophies of the Ages
Are from Mother Love impeached;

4. Darling girls, with Eden music
Ringing yet in each young heart,
Learn and treasure household knowledge,
Precious in Life's future part
When you'll too, exulting mothers,
Bravely boyed and gently girled,

5. Blessings on the hand of Woman!
Fathers, sons, and daughters cry,
And the sacred song is mingled
With the worship in the sky,
Mingles where no tempest darkens,
Rainbows evermore are curled;
