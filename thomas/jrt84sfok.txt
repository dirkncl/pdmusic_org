1. Oh! the fair summer morning all sparkling with dew, 
When I met in the valley my colleen so true, 
Pretty roses around her were blushing for shame. 
And the birds of the wildwood were warbling her name. 
She was bright as a vision of angels above, 
And the heart in my bosom was melting with love, 
Oh! it’s deep in my soul I shall keep ever more  

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
That sweet Flower of Kilmeena, 
The girl I adore, 
That sweet flower of Kilmeena, 
The girl I adore.

 2. Oh! the smiles of my darling are dearer to me, 
Than the light of the morning, the wealth of the sea; 
Tho’ afar I am straying, I know she is true. 
And my heart’s in her keeping since we bade adieu. 
Tho’ the winter of sorrow has blighted our joys. 
Yet there’s one gem of heauty which time ne’er destroys, 
Oh! it’s here in my heart that it blooms ever more
