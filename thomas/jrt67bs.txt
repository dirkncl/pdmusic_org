1. Beyond the upland reaches
The sun is sinking low,
The waves along the breaches
Are purple in its glow,--
  Are purple in its glow.
Come on, my sturdy rowers!
With sinews strong as steel;
Come, grasp the bending oars,
Push off the grating keel!

2. Across the harbor waving,
The summer woods are green,
And waters softly curling
In small waves lie between,--
  In small waves lie between.
The wind is freshly blowing
From leagues away at sea;
Come on, my sturdy rowers,
And taste its joys with me!

3. Now pull, my sturdy rowers,
With steady strokes away!
The track is smooth before us,
Our oars keep merry play!
  Our oars keep merry play.
Hurrah! we ride like sea-kings
Across the sparkling brine,
And feel in all our pulses
The red blood leap like wine!

4. Row light! we near the shadows,--
Row light along the shore.
The waters break in sll over
From off the gleaming oar,--
  From off the gleaming oar!
The evening breeze is creeping
In spicy airs along;
Now soft, my sturdy rowers!
Take up the homeward song.
