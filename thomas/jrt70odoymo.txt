1. O when the morn is waking, 
And my heart is all alone, 
I sigh not, if I only keep 
One dream of you, my own! 
When the stars are softly beaming, 
And falls the tranquil night, 
Do you gaze, while still I’m gazing, 
On their fair and tender light? 

[Refrain sung after each verse]
O, when the morn is waking, 
And my heart is still alone, 
I sigh not, if I only keep 
One dream of you, my own!

2. O, leaves may dream of summer, 
The rose may dream of dew; 
And birds may dream of bloom and flow’rs,— 
’Tis mine to dream of you! 
Each day that leaves me finds you 
Still dearer, dearer grown! 
Let life take all but leave me— 
One dream of you, my own!
