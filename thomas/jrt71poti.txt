1. O, the sweetest of names I recall in my dreams, 
When the past, like a star, in my memory beams! 
And I roam once again on the shore of the sea, 
And I look in the eyes that were glory to me! 
Ev’ry joy of my spring time has fadad away, 
Like our steps on the sand when our lifetime was gay; 
But I dream of thy beauty, and sigh for thy smile, 
And I ne’er can forget thee Sweet Pearl of the Isle, 
I ne’er can forget thee sweet Pearl of the Isle.

2. O, the morning of life, how it pass’d from our view! 
Never lips were so sweet! never hearts were so true! 
There were cheeks that outvied the rare tints of the shell; 
There were hands that were white as the fair lily bell! 
How I long but to ramble again on the shore, 
But my dear sunny land I shall greet never more! 
Yet I dream of thy beauty, and sigh for thy smile, 
And I ne’er can forget thee Sweet Pearl of the Isle, 
I ne’er can forget thee sweet Pearl of the Isle.
