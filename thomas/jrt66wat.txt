1. When poor in all but truth and love 
I clasped thee to this beating heart. 
And vowed for fame and wealth to rove, 
That we might meet no more to part. 
Years have gone by, long years of toll, 
To win thee peace and comfort now, 
Of ardent hopes and burning fears and wealth is mine, 
Wealth is mine, but where, where art thou? 

2. Fame’s dazzling dream for thy dear sake, 
Grew brighter than before to me, 
I grasped at all I thought could make 
This loving heart more worthy thee; 
Years have gone by, the laurel droops 
In mock’ry o’er my fevered brow, 
A conquered world before me stoops, and fame is mine, 
Fame is mine, but where, where art thou?

3. In youth’s first hours des tined and lone, 
I wandered ’mid the busy crowd, 
But now that life’ best hopes are gone 
They greet with smiles and murmurs loud, 
Ah! for thy voice thy laughing voice, 
To give its happy wellcom now, 
Wealth, fame, and all that can rejoice, are mine in vain, 
Mine in vain, for where, where art thou?
