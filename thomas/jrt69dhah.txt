1. Hearth and home, delightful dream!
O, the joys you now recall!
Hope and love around you beam,
Sweetly sad your echoes fall.
Gentle words and loving smiles,
Live again in hallowed light;
Childhood's path o'er moon and star,
Find you still, dear hearth and home!

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Hearth and home! the tender sigh,
Falls for you while footsteps roam!
Visions wake that never die,
Born of you, dear hearth and Home!
[with CHORUS]
Hearth and Home! (Dear Hearth and Home!)
Hearth and Home! (Dear Hearth and Home!)
Dear Hearth and Home!

2. Years may die, and flow'rs may fade,
Time shall leave you still the May;
Back to you our hearts have strayed--
Back to you from day to day.
Life but binds you closer far;
O, when here no more we roam,
May the path o'er moon and star,
Find you still, dear hearth and home!
