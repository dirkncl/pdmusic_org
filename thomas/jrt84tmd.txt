1.
It is the miller's daughter
And she is grown so dear, so dear
That I would be the jewel
That trembles at her ear;
For hid in ringlets day and night
I'd touch her neck so warm and white,
  For hid in ringlets day and night
  I'd touch her neck so warm and white.


2.
And I would be the girdle
About her dainty, dainty waist
And her heart would beat against me
In sorrow and in rest;
And I should know if it beat right
I'd clasp it round so close and tight,
  And I should know if it beat right
  I'd clasp it round so close and tight.

3.
And I would be the necklace,
And all day long to fall and rise
Upon her balmy bosom
With her laughter or her sighs,
And I would lie so light, so light
I scarce should be unclasp'd at night,
  And I would lie so light, so light
  I scarce should be unclasp'd at night.
