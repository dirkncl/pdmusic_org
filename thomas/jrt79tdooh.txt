1.We hear their voices gaily ring
In sweet and pure delight;
Their snowy arms around us cling;
Their hopes are warm and bright,
Our hearts are longing to caress them,
While far away we sadly roam;
We fondly pray that Heav'n will bless them,--
The darlings of our home!
  We fondly pray that Heav'n will bless them,--
  The darlings of our home!

2. The waving wheat in morning's breeze,
Is sweet unto the ear;
But there are sweeter tone than these
In childhood's laugh so dear!
Fair lilies blooming on life's river!
No weary shadows 'round them come;
May love and sunlight bless forever
The darlings of our home!
  May love and sunlight bless forever
  The darlings of our home!

3. This earth would be a dreary place,
If we should see no more
Each loving, kind, and little face
That greets us at the door!
Oh, best and brightest of life's pleasures
That wait us 'neath yon starry dome;
Our rosy, fond and dimpled treasure,
The darlings of our home!
  Our rosy, fond and dimpled treasure,
  The darlings of our home!
