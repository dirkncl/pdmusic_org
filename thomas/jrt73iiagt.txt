It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, 
And to sing praises unto thy Name, O most Highest; 
to tell of thy loving kindness early in the morning, 
and of thy truth in the night season, 
upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; 
Upon a loud instrument, and upon the harp. 
For thou Lord hast made me glad through thy works; 
and I will rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands. 
Glory be to the Father, 
And to the Son, 
And to the Holy Ghost; 
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, 
World without end, 
Amen, Amen.
