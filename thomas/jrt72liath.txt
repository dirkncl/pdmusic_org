1.
Awake, awake my dearest,
My shallop waits for thee,
From ev'ry care thou fearest,
Oh! come my love to me!
Oh! come my love to me!
By shores, by shores of chilling sadness,
Where sorrows, where sorrows overwhelm,
We'll glie in peaceful gladness,
For Love is at the helm.
For Love, Love is at the helm.

2.
Arise, arise in glory,
And shame the stars on high!
My heart would breathe its story
Beneath the radiant sky,
Beneath the radiant sky.
While o'er, while o'er the deep we're bounding
No storms, no storms overwhelm,
The voice of hope is sounding
And Love is at the helm.
Yes Love is at the helm.
Yes Love Love is is at the helm.
