1. I gaze upon its tiny flow’rs, 
Their dainty bloom and fragrance flows; 
I live a dream of other hours, 
When hope and love were all my own! 
A simple act it was to you,— 
A passing whim soon to forget, 
You gave me, dimpled o’er with dew, 
This faded spray of mignonnette, 
You gave me, dimpled o’er with dew, 
This faded spray of mignonnette.

2. You held the treasure lightly then, 
A pretty flow’r and nothing more; 
But o’er its dust I hear again 
Each loving word you whispered o’er! 
The many joys that life can give, 
May leave me now without regret; 
But love itself could not outlive 
My faded spray of mignonnette, 
But love itself could not outlive, 
My faded spray of mignonnette.
