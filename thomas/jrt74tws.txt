There were shepherds abiding in the fold, 
Keeping watch, keeping watch, 
keeping watch o’er their flocks by night. 
And lo! the angel of the Lord came upon them, 
and the Glory of the Lord shone round about them, 
and they were sore afraid. 
And the angel said unto them, “Fear not, 
For behold, I bring you good tidings of joy 
which shall be to all people; 
For unto you is born this day, 
in the city of David, a Saviour, 
which is Christ the Lord.” 
And suddenly there was with the angel 
a multitude of the heav’nly host, 
praising God, and saying: 
Glory to God, Glory to God, 
Glory to God in the highest, 
Glory to God, Glory to God, 
Glory to God in the highest, 
And peace on earth, good will towards men, 
good will towards men, good will towards men, 
good will towards men, good will towards men, 
good will towards men, good will towards men, 
good will towards men.
