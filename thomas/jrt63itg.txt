1.
I am dreaming, ever dreaming
Of the woodland and the glade,
Of the oak tree 'neath whose branches
In the starlight oft we stray'd;
And I hear a voice now silent,
That did whisper soft and low
Words of hope and love endearing,
In those days of long ago;
Words of hope and love endearing
In those days of long ago,
In those days of long ago.

2.
I am dreaming, ever dreaming
Of the happy bygone years,
When my soul was free from anguish,
And I wept no bitter tears;
Of the world, its cares and sorrows
And its frowns was never afraid
While beside thee in the starlight
Stood I dreaming in the glade;
While beside thee in the starlight
Stood I dreaming in the glade,
Stood I dreaming in the glade.

3.
I am dreaming, ever dreaming
Of a lonely quiet grave,
Where they laid thee in thy beauty
When no pow'r on earth could save;
And I see thy paleface ever
Peering at me thro' the shade,
And do hear thy farewell blessing
As we parted in the glade;
And I hear thy farewell blessing
As we parted in the glade,
As we parted in the glade.
