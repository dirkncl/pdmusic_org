1. There is color in the wineglass, 
There is fire beneath its crest; 
There are sparkles in the goblet, 
Gems of light made manifest 
But the hue is red, infernal, 
Hot with food for mad desire; 
Ev’ry sparkle is a demon, 
Gladly leaping in the fire.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O, then, touch not, taste not, 
Join the temp’rance throng; 
Precious moments waste not, 
List our temp’rance song.

2. There is laughter where they revel 
In their wild and drunken glee, 
But ’tis cold, and false, and hollow, 
Born for woe and misery; 
Friendship form’d by wine is fleeting, 
Love abhors its unchaste light; 
Nothing born of wine is lasting, 
With its sparkles joy takes flight.

3. Then abhor the flashing goblet,
Hate and shun its deadly glare;
Read upon the scarlet record
Sin, and woe, and dark despair;
Homes made cold, and oh! how wretched,
None but _victims_ e’er can tell
Victims who, by thousands dying,
Woe’s wild ocean yearly swell.

4. Minds of might and brilliant genius,
Which with light refulgent shone,
Now are dark, and lost, and shattered,
All their strength and power gone;
Forms of bright majestic beauty,
Which amid our circle trod,
Now beneath the ground are restling,
Lost to us and lost to God.

5. Then avoid the mocking sirens
Who would charm you to their side;
Think upon the sinking millions
Who are drifting down the tide;
Think of firesides, now deserted,
Once so cheerful, bright, and gay;
Think ’twas caused by wine and revel,
And forever turn away.
