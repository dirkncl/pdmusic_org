1. Gone  beyond the darksome river; 
Only left us by the way; 
Gone beyond the night forever; 
Only gone to endless day! 
Gone to meet the angel faces, 
Where our lovely treasures are; 
Gone awhile from our embraces,— 
Gone within the gates ajar!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
There’s a sister, there’s a brother, 
Where our lovely treasures are; 
There’s a father, there’s a mother, 
Gone within the gates ajar.

2. One by one, they go before us;
They are fading like the dew;
But we know they’re watching o’er us,
They the good, the fair, the true!
They are waiting for us, only,
Where no pain can ever mar;
Little ones who left us lonely,
Watch us thro’ the gates ajay!

3. Gone where ev’ry eye is tearless;
Only gone from earthly care;
O, the waiting, sad and cheerless,
Till we meet our loved ones there!
Sweet the rest from all our roving,
Land of light and hope afar!
Lo! our Father’s hand so loving,
Sets the pearly gates ajar!
