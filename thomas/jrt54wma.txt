1.
When friend from friend is doom'd to stray,
 And glist'ning is each eye;
When lips with trembling accents say
 The last fond word "Good Bye,"
One thought still cheers the drroping heart
 And soothes the bosom's pain
That tho' in sorrow we depart,
 In joy we meet again, we meet, we meet again.

CHORUS [sung afte each verse]
We meet again, 
We meet again, we meet again, we meet again,

2.
The wand'rer far from those he loves
 And all his heart holds dear;
Oft ling'ring as he onward roves,
 To check the rising tear--
When thoughts of home and bygone days
 Come crowding o'er his brain
How sweet the voice within that says:
 "Hope on, we meet again, we meet, we meet again.

3.
And when we near the bed of death,
 Shall watch life's less'ning say,
While as we gaze the feeble breath,
 Is fleeting fast away;--
In that dark hour of bitter woe
 When tears are all in vain,
Calm o'er the soul these words shall flow:
 "In Heav'n we meet again."
