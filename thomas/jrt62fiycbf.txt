1. In the journey of life all wishing to find 
In our family’s happiness beam 
Be gentle, be cheerful, forbearing, and mind, 
Let Forgiveness be ever your theme. 
Should you e’er be deceived by a friend you have loved, 
As in peace you hereafter would live; 
Let your heart by a thirst for revenge be unmoved, 
And forget if you can, forget if you can, 
forget if you can but Forgive. 

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Forget if you can, forget if you can, 
for get if you can, but Forgive.

2. Remember the precept, “to do unto men 
As you would they should do unto you”. 
How many a pang will your conscience be saved 
Should you e’er keep this motto to view? 
Then gain a command o’er each stubborn resolve 
’Tis a glorious deed to achieve; 
You’ll be amply repaid by the pow’r to absolve, 
So forget if you can, forget if you can,
forget if you can but Forgive.
