1. “Speculation” is the theme 
That every soul arouses; 
’Tis the maiden’s artless dream 
Who sighs for love and houses! 
“Speculation” never stops 
When once we all begin it; 
Land, or gold, or flour, or hops,— 
Why “there’s millions in it!” 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
“Hogs!” Why here’s a fortune there, 
Anyone may win it; 
“Corn!” its wealth I can’t compare,— 
Why, there’s millions in it!” 
[SPOKEN: 1. "Yes, it don't make any difference for instance--]
[SPOKEN: 2. "Dear little charmer or unsophisticated--]
[SPOKEN: 3. "Mules," or "eyewash" or--]
“Hogs!” Why here’s a fortune there! 
Any one may win it; 
“Corn!” its wealth I can’t compare,— 
Why, “there’s millions in it!”

2. “Fitz Augustus” is a youth 
Whose noodle is the lightest; 
Comes along the widow “Truth” 
With eyes that  are the brightest. 
Now, her dimes are on the wane, 
His fortune she must win it; 
“Speculation” is her game,— 
Why, “there’s millions in it!”

3. So, the world is wagging on, 
And will be till it ceases; 
All have “Speculative” grown, 
And want the wealth of Croesus. 
Old and young their fortune see, 
And struggle on to win it; 
Each pet scheme they all agree,— 
Why, “there’s millions in it!”
