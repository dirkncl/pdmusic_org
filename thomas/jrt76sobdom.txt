[Charles]
1. I would not bid those lovely eyes
Unclose like flow'rs like flow'rs at peep of day!
Tho' still to hear thy fond replies,
My heart would stay, my heart would stay,
Oh! be thy visions bright and fair,
While slumber reigns o'er land and sea;
And this be love's delicious pray'r:

[Refrain sung after each verse]
Sleep on, sleep on, but dream of me!
Sleep on, sleep on, but dream of me!

2. So deep the love my heart doth keep,
That envy still should be, should be mine own,
If I shared not, amid thy sleep,
One thought alone, one thought alone!
Then while my heart in sweet delight
Awakes and fondly dreams of thee
In angel visions, pure and bright:
