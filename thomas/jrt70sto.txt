1. Still thine own! still thine own! 
Star of all my weary vigils! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
While I watch for thee! 
Day by day, tears that fall, 
Tell my love, my pain! 
Snow and leaf but recall 
Hours that died in vain! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
Star of all my weary vigils! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
While I watch for thee!

2. Still thine own! sill thine own! 
One by one the leaves are falling! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
Tho’ my heart repines! 
Stars of night lead thee here! 
Waves be kind and true! 
Mine the doubt, mine the fear; 
Joy thy way pursue! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
Star of all my weary vigils! 
Still thine own! still thine own! 
While I watch for thee!
