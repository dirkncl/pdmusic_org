1.
In the hollow tree, in the old grey tow'r,
The spectral Owl doth dwell,
Dull, hated, despised in the sunshine hour,
But at dark he's abroad and well.
Not a bird of the forest ere mates with him,
All mock him outright by day,
But at night when the woods grow still and slim,
The boldest will shrink away
O when the night falls and roosts the fowl,
Then, then is the reign of the Horned Owl!
Then, then, then, then is the reign of the Horned Owl!
Then, then, then, then is the reign of the Horned Owl!

2.
And the Owl hath a bride who is fond and bold,
And loveth the woods' deep gloom,
And with eyes like the shine of the moonstone cold,
She awaiteth her ghastly groom!
Not a feather she moves, not a carol she sings,
As she waits in the trees so still,
But when her hearing heareth his flapping wings,
She boots out her welcome shrill!
O then the moon shines and dogs do howl,
Then, then is the joy of the Horned Owl!
Then, then, then, then is the joy of the Horned Owl!
Then, then, then, then is the joy of the Horned Owl!
Then, then, then, then is the joy of the Horned Owl!

3.
Mourn not for the Owl, nor his gloomy plight,
The Owl hath his share of good;
If a prisher is he in the broad daylight,
He is Lord of the dark green wood.
Nor lonely the bird, nor his ghastly mate,
They're each unto each a pride,
Thrice fonder, perhaps since a strange dark fate
Hath rent them from all beside
So when the night falls and dogs do howl,
Sing ho! for the reign of the Horned Owl!
We know not alway who are kings by day,
But the king of the night is the bold brown Owl!
Yes the king of the night is the bold brown Owl!
