1. There's an angel, gently stealing
O'er each home upon this earth,
Breathing tones of kindest feeling,
Waking all that's good to birth;
E'er obeying Heaven's mission,
Soft'ning manhood's worldly strife:
This is woman's dear tuition--
She's the angel of our life!
  This is woman's dear truition--
  She's the angel of our life!

2. When the hour of woe is near me,
She's the angel voice that breathes
Words of comfort, that will cheer us,
E'en when twin'd with cypress wreathes;
Then e'er speak in accents tender,
Be she mother, sister, wife,--
Too much joy thou canst not render,
She's the angel of our life!
  Too much joy thou canst not render,
  She's the angel of our life!
