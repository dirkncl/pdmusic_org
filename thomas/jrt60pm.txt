1. Pleasant mem’ries softly stealing, 
Echoing thoughts of former years, 
Faces of the past revealing, 
Bath’d in mem’ries silent tears; 
Feelings buried with the past, 
Come like some remember’d strain, 
Joys by sorrow long o’er cast, 
Pleasant mem’ries wake again. 
Wake again, Wake again. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Pleasant mem’ries softly stealing, 
Echoing thoughts of former years, 
Faces of the past revealing, 
Bath’d in mem’ry’s silent tears; 
Pleasant mem’ries wake again, 
Pleasant mem’ries wake again.

2. Pleasant mem’ries, dearest blessing 
Heav’n hath giv’n to soothe the breast,— 
Life no greater charm possessing, 
Lulling aching hearts to rest; 
Hope long faded, past away, 
Bloom as in life’s early spring, 
Dreams of many  a happy day, 
Pleasant mem’ries oft ye bring. 
Oft ye bring, Oft ye bring.
