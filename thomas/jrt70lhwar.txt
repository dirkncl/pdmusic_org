1.
Love he went a-roving
On a sunny day.
Soon he met a maiden
Fair as dewy May!
Long she would not linger,
But she gaily said,
"Come again tomorrow,
Time enough to wed"!
Love he wandered homeward,
Singing as he went,
"Those who slight me now, dear,
Some day may repent!"
  "Those who slight me now, dear,
  Some day may repent!"

2.
Soon the roses faded,
Icy grew the blast;
Then the maid was lonely,
Sad she grew at last.
Though she often wanders,
Where they met before,
She and Love are strangers,
For he comes no more!
Long the maided gazes
Down the road he went,
Singing "come again, Love,
Dearly, I repent!"
  Singing "come again, Love,
  Dearly, I repent!"
