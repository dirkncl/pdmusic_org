1. Father, hear us! Father, hear us!
Be thou near us,
Ever near us,
Let thy spirit bless and cheer us
While we journey on our way,
Help to save us, lowly bending;
Shades of evening 'round us blending;
Give, O! give us peace unending,
Guide and keep us till the day.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Father, hear us! Father, hear us!
Be thou near us, ever near us,
Let thy spirit bless and cheer us
While we journey on our way.

2.
Doubt and sorrow long have bound us,
Ills unnumbered flock around us,
Heav'nly Father! thou hast found us
Full of sadness and of guilt;
For thy blessing humbly sighing,
Ohn thy mercy still relying,
Sweet is living, sweet is dying,
Guide us, Father, as thou wilt.
