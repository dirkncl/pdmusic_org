1.
Let us speak of a man as we find him
And censure alone what we seee
And should a man blame let's remind him
That from faults we none of us free.
If the soil from the heart could be torn
And the mind could be read on the brow
There are many we'd pass by with scorn
When we'er loading with high honors now.
 Let us speak of a man as we find him
 And censure alone what we see
 And should a man blame let's remind him
 That from faults we are none of us free.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Let us speak of a man,
Let us speak of a man,
Let us speak of a man as we find him.

2.
Let us speak of a man as we find him
And heed not what others may say
If he's frail then a kind word will bind him
Where coldness would turn him away.
For the heart must be barren indeed
Where no bud of repentance may bloom
Then prune ere you raise it to bleed
On a smile or a frown hangs its doom.
 Let us speak of a man as we find him
 And heed not what others may say
 If he's frail then a kind word will bind him
 Where coldness would turn him away.
