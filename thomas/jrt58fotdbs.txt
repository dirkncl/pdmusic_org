1. Far on the deep blue sea,
The ever moving sea,
Our hearts will fondly turn
Beloved home to thee;
And all who made it dear,
The loving and the true,
We ne'er may see again,
How turn our hearts to you!
Thus as we watch the foam
Dart backward on our lee,
We think of thee dear home,
Far on the deep blue sea,
Far on the deep blue sea.

2. Swift o'er the rolling wave
Our bark speeds gaily on,
Each billow seems the grave
Of happy moments gone;
Hope points to brighter hours,
We wipe our tears away,
And think blest land
Where friendships ne'er decay!
Still as we watch the foam
Dart backward on our lee,
We think of thee dear home,
Far on the deep blue sea,
Far on the deep blue sea.
