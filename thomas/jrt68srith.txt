1. When the merry birds are flying 
Far beyond the wintry wave: 
When the purple leaves are dying, 
And the flow’rs are in the grave, 
Shall we sigh while earth is sleeping? 
Shall we mourn that joys depart? 
Let us hold within our keeping— 
Summer roses in the heart! 
Let us hold within our keeping— 
Summer roses in the heart!

2. When the days are dark and dreary; 
When the hopes of youth decay; 
Shall we linger sad and weary, 
Sighing for the gentle May? 
Though the wintry winds are blowing, 
Yet we know they soon depart: 
Sweet, O, sweet while Time is flowing— 
Summer roses in the heart! 
Sweet, O, sweet, while Time is flowing— 
Summer roses in the heart!
