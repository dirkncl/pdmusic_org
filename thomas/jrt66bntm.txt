1. Be near to me!
Be near to me!
O! linger by my side,
When like some merry melody,
The golden moments glide;
For all that Pleasure's hand may give,
Shall win no smile from me,
In gloom I must forever live,
'Mid joys unshar'd with thee.
Be near to me!
My own, my own, be near to me!

2. Be near to me!
Be near to me!
When happy days are fled,
And sorrow, like the sounding sea,
Is rolling o'er its dead;
Then, ev'ry pang that grief may give,
Shall win no sigh from mem
In joy I must forever live,
When life I shar'd with thee.
Be near to me,
My own, my own, be near to me!
