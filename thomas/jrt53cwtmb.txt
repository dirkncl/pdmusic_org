1. Come while the moonlight beams
  Brightly on hill and grove.
Come while the melting radiance, streams,
  O'er all, like a dream of love.
The night hath in the sky
  Her starry veil unfurl'd
And soft winds sing their lullaby
  Over the sleeping world,
I am waiting, love for thee.
  Oh wherefore dost thou stay,
Each waving flow'r and tree,
  Are beck'ning, beck'ning us away,
Then come while the moonlight beams
  Brightly in hill and grove.
Come while the melting radiance streams,
  O'er all like a dream of love.

2. Moonlight, Love, and flowers!
  How near to Heav'n ye are,
There's nought within this world of ours,
  Can with thy bliss compare.
Oh! that my love would haste
  And fly to yonder bower;
Nor thus these precious moments waste,
  Fraught with such rapt'rous power.
Oh! say love willt thou go,
  No mortal sound is near;
And music soft and low,
  Shall charm thy list'ning ear,
Then come while the moonlight beams,
  Brightly on hill and grove;
Come while the melting radiance streams,
  O'er all like a dream of love!
