1. Oh! why are thou dreaming? 
The bright moon is beaming, 
Giving the lustre of day to the night! 
Awake from thy slumbers, 
And list to my numbers, 
Rise like a star in the regions of light!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O come love to me, 
And our carol shall be: 
Over the  waters, over the waters, 
over the waters I’ll wander with thee! 
O ver the waters, over the waters, 
over the waters I’ll wander with thee.

2. Arise from thy pillow, 
Come over the billow, 
Oh there is danger in longer delay! 
Ere Sol is adorning 
The hilltops of morning, 
Lady arise! with thy lover away!
