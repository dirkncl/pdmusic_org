1.
There are sorrows, weary sorrows
In the daily path of all,
You will find no human bosom
Where they never sadly fall;
For they come like clouds in summer,
Veiling all our happy dreams,
And we languish, never heeding,
That the sun behind them beams.
Lest us seek to bear up nobly,
With a firm and earnest will,
And whatever ills betide us,
Let us keep a brave heart still.
Keep a brave heart still,
Keep a brave heart still,
Keep a brave heart still.

2.
When our brother's men around us,
To the earth are bowing down,
Let us ever from our forehead
Drive the sad and gloomy frown;
For in kindly words of comfort,
There is wealth of joy unknow,
And a smile will often cheer them
When the dearest hopes are flown.
Then with holy balm of kindness,
Let us seek their cups to fill,
Bid them rise, and bid them ever;
Keep a brave heart still,
Keep a brave heart still,
Keep a brave heart still,
Keep a brave heart still.
