[NOTE: Soprano solo thru-out,
with ATB singing "Hallalujah!" repeatedly
ending with "Amen."]

1.
I hear sweet voices singing
The anthems of the skies,
And golden bells are ringing
A theme that never dies.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then let no thought or sadness,
Dear mother, rest on thee,
But be your heart all gladness
When you remember me,
When you remember me.

2.
I see bright angels bending
In glory 'round my head,
A heavenly radiance lending,
That they alone can shed.

3.
I grieve, but oh! thy sorrow,
Yet, think I go before,
'Twill only be tomorrow,
And we shall part no more.
