Angels, roll the rock away! 
Death, yield up the mighty Prey. 
See the Saviour quits the tomb, 
Glowing glowing with immortal bloom. 
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, 
Christ the Lord is ris’n today. 
Alleluia Alleluia Alleluia 
Shout ye Seraphs, 
Angels, raise your eternal song of praise; 
Let the earth’s remotest bound 
Echo to the blissfull sound. 
Christ the Lord is ris’n today. 
Holy Father, Holy Son, 
Holy Spirit Three in One. 
Glory, glory as of old to thee, 
Now and evermore shall be, 
Glory as of old to thee, 
Now and evermore shall be, 
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia! 
Christ the Lord is ris’n today.
