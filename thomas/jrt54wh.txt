1. Welcome Home! thou long-lost rover,
  Welcome, welcome, welcome home!
All our doubts and fears are over,
  Dearest one at last thou'rt come;
Oh, how we have yearn'd to greet thee,
  Many a long and weary day,
And our hearts went forth to meet thee
  When thou still wert far away.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Welcome home, (Welcome home,)
welcome home, )welcome home,)
welcome home, welcome home!

2. Many years have glided o'er thee
  Since thou had'st thy long adieu,
And the gallant ship that bore thee
  Faded in th' horizon blue;
Oft we've thought on that sad parting
  Sealed by many a fervent pray'r,
Oft too felt the teardrop starting
  When we view'd thy vacant chair.

3. Welcome home thou long lost rover,
  Welcome, welcome, welcome home!
All our anxious fears are over,
  And thou ne'er again shalt roam;
Now away with thoughts of sadness,
  Let them slumber in the past,
For our hearts are fill'd with gladness,
  Dearest one thou'rt come at last.
