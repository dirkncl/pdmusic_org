1. 
The sun is dropping down the west, 
The little birds have gone to rest; 
And little feet have weary grown, 
And mother watches all alone. 
While fondly bending o’er her child, 
To pleasant land of dreams beguiled, 
Oh! softly sweet is uttered there, 
In pleading words the mother’s prayer, 
“Oh! sleep, my little darling, sleep! 
While ev’ning shadows round thee creep, 
For He who marks the sparrow’s flight, 
Will keep my babe from harm tonight.” 

2. 
How fondly ’mid her joys and fears 
The mother waits the coming years; 
For little feet may go astray 
And wander from the narrow way! 
That angel hands may shield his life 
Amid the neverending strife,— 
That love may banish pain and care, 
Is all the mother’s earnest prayer. 
“Oh! sleep my little darling, sleep! 
While ev’ning shadows round thee creep, 
For He who marks the sparrow’s flight 
Will keep my babe from harm to­night, 
Will keep my babe from harm tonight.”
