1. Who would care for friendship’s dower 
If the bliss, the joy it brought, 
Only blest the passing hour 
And should scorn all future thought? 
Though the world may bid us sever, 
And we dwell in distant climes, 
Yet the heart will murmur ever— 
Think of me sometimes! 
Think of me, think of me, 
think of me sometimes!

 2. E’en though other smiles may meet you, 
And though words of tender tone 
Breathed by other voices greet you, 
And should win you all their own; 
Yet, may be, so sweetly ringing, 
Will awaken mem’ry’s chimes, 
’Mid the thoughts those tones are bringing— 
Think of me sometimes! 
Think of me, think of me, 
think of me sometimes!

 3. When I muse o’er days departed, 
Of the joy that we have seen, 
Dream what true and single hearted 
Friends together we have been; 
O’er my heart the truth comes stealing, 
That through change of years and climes, 
You will still with selfsome feeling— 
Think of me sometimes! 
Think of me, think of me, 
think of me sometimes!
