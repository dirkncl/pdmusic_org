1. A song for those who love us, 
Whereever they may be! 
How many of them wander 
Upon the land and sea! 
They meet us in our visions, 
They come to cheer us now; 
Again we roam together, 
While birds are on the bough! 
The years have brought us trouble, 
The years have brought us care, 
But, O, the days of pleasure, 
When all our skies were fair. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
So while our friends may wander 
Upon the land and sea, 
A song for those who love us, 
Where ever They may be!

2. A song for those who love us, 
The roses of our home! 
We find no brighter glories, 
While down the step we roam! 
The kindly hand of welcome, 
The eyes that fondly greet; 
The merry laugh of childhood 
There’s nothing half so sweet! 
The years may bring us sorrow, 
The years may bring us pain, 
But while we’ve one to love us, 
We have not lived in vain.
