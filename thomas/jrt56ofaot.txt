1. Thinking of old times, 
Hopes ne’er to be, 
Speaking of old friends, 
Far o’er the sea; 
Distance can change not 
Dear ones like you, 
Fortune estrange not 
Hearts that sre true; 
Thus in the twilight 
Fond thoughts will stray 
Back to the old homes, 
Homes far away!

CHORUS
1. Homes far away, 
Far, far away, 
Homes far away, 
Far, far away!

2. O ’mid the old friends 
I no more see, 
Is there a kind thought 
Ever for me? 
If there’s but one hope, 
One wish, though vain, 
If there’s but one sigh, 
I’ll not complain; 
Thus in the twilight 
Tears oft will stray, 
Thinking of old friends, 
Friends far away!

CHORUS
2. Friends far away, 
Far, far away, 
Friends far away, 
Far, far away!
