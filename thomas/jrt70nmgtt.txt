[SOPRANO SOLO]
Nearer, my God, to Thee! 
Nearer to Thee! 
E’n though it be a cross 
That raiseth me; 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! 

[Tutti]
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! 

[QUARTETTE]
Though like a wanderer, 
Weary and lone, 
Darkness comes over me, 
My rest a stone, 
Yet in my dreams I’d be, 
Nearer, my God to Thee! 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee!

[SOPRANO] 
There let my way appear, 
Steps unto heav’n; 
All that Thou sendest me, 
In mercy giv’n; 
Angels to beckon me, 
Nearer, my God to Thee, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee!

[Tutti] 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee! 

[Tutti]
Or, if on joyful wing, 
Clearing the sky, 
Sun, moon and stars forgot, 
Upward I fly; 
Still all my song shall be, 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
Nearer, my God to Thee, 
Nearer to Thee!
