1.
I see thy smile in visions bright,
While beaming sweet and clear
Throughout the dime silent night
When all is dark and drear.
It tells me of days long, long ago
When all was bright with love's pure glow
Where spotless beautiful as snow
Did life's sweet hopes appear.
Did life's sweet hopes appear.

2.
I dream of hours when purest joy
Around my pathway shone
In brightest scenes without alloy
And I was not alone.
When fell thy smiles like sunbeams bright
Illuming life's sad dreary night
Oh! then came hours of sweet delight
That from me now are gone.
That from me now are gone.

3.
I see thy smile in visions bright,
But morning bids it fly
And with the dawning of the light
Its radiant glories die.
Yet still its mem'ries fill my heart
And hope of joy again impart--
Of life and love they form apart
Nor wholly fade with light.
Nor wholly fade with light.
