1. Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy? 
Oh! must the love we plighted 
One bitter word destroy? 
Life without thee were lonely; 
Thou art my spirit’s sigh; 
Bid not affection’s roses 
Wither and fade and die. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
O, must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy? 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy?

2. Can we then meet as strangers, 
When we recall the past? 
Will not its beauteous vision 
Deathless in mem’ry last? 
Give me the smiles of gladness 
Once I could fondly claim; 
Whisper with sweet affection,— 
Whisper that once loved name!
