When Life was May, Oh! bright and gay, 
I roamed upon the merry leas; 
And free as air, I knew no care, 
My friends the sunlight, the sunlight and the breeze. 

Never sighing, never pining. 
Pain, Pain and sorrow passing, passing by, 
Hope and beauty round me shining, 
Who so happy, who so happy then as I? 

When life was May, Oh! bright and gay, 
I roamed upon the merry leas; 
And free as air, I knew no care, 
My friends, the sunlight, the sunlight and the breeze. 

Now I’m grieving, Love’s deceiving! 
Never chiding, still, still believing, 
Hearts their folly still are proving, 
When they sadly wake to loving 
Ah! yes, Ah! yes, Ah! yes, 

when Life was May, Oh! bright and gay, 
I roamed upon the merry leas; 
And free as air, I knew no care, 
My friends, the sunlight, and the breeze. 

Ah! me, When Life was May, 
How bright, bright and gay, 
la la la la la la la la la la la.
