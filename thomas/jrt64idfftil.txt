1.
I am dying far from those I love;
No gentle voice my way to cheer;
How calmly would my breath depart,
If loving ones were only near,
No Mother's lips are on my brow,
But strangers watch my lonely bed;
And no one here will shed a tear,
When I am lying cold and dead.

CHORUS (ad lib.) [sung after each verse]
I'm dying far from those I love,
(from those I love,)
No gentle voice my way to cheer.
(my way to cheer,)
How calm-(how calm-)ly would my breath depart,
(my breath depart,)
If loving ones were only near.
(were only near.)

2.
I'm dying far from those I love;
O tell them, in the gory fight
I bore our banner's starry folds,
And battled for the Truth and Right,
What grief will rend poor Mother's heart,
To hear my mournful story told!
I was her pride, and by her side
I thought to stay when she was old.

3.
I'm dying far from those I love'
I'm going now-- my eyes are dim,
And all around there softly falls
The angel's sweet and happy hymn,
O stranger bear my parting words
To those at home so true and dear,
Tell them in love we'll meet above,
Though we are sadly severed here.
