1.
Meet me tonight dearest! down by the gate,
Anxiously, longingly for thee I'll wait;
There, while the lady moon softly reclines,
There, while her beaming eye lovingly shines;
In sweetest dreams of thee, happy I'll wait,

[Refrain sung after each verse]
Eager to meet thee, love,
Eager to meet thee, love,
Eager to meet thee, love, down by the gate.

2.
Come, gently gliding, on love's downy wings,
Over the vale when the nightengale sings;
On the soft zephyr her music will move,
Pleading to thee in its murmurs of love;
Ev'ry soft whisper will tell thee I wait,

3.
Meet me tonight, dearest! day will soon close,
Yonder the sun softly sinks to repose;
Love will awake as the starlights arise,
On me will shine through thy dreamy eyes;
Visions of joy will be mine as I wait,
