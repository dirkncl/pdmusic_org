1. Comrades, be true to our country, for ever,
Let no invader its bright glory stain;
Fixed be our hearts on one lasting endeavor,
All our great birthrights to bravely maintain.
Foes shall not tauntingly point with shame's finger
To our old banner on rampart and crag,
Thousands have died for it, we should no linger
When we are called on to follow the flag,
  When we are called on to follow the flag!

2. Stand by the flag that true hearts have defended,
When the fierce tempests of battle shall come,
Ever are courage and loyalty blended,
Gather our legions and beat ev'ry drum,
Ever be true to the trust we inherit,
On with the struggle, and let no one lag,
True to the past and the present, our spirit,
Laurels shall crown those who follow the flag,
  Laurels shall crown those who follow the flag!

3. Oh! not in vain are our brave comrades sleeping,
On fields where Mars his dark wings has outspread,
We will avenge them, yes! brave hearts are leaping,
Scorning to live, unless treason be dead;
Up with our banner, then, let it wave o'er us,
Let it float proudly from rampart and crag,
Let our brave legions shout loyalty's chorus
Thrilling and grand as we follow the flag,
  Thrilling and grand as we follow the flag!
