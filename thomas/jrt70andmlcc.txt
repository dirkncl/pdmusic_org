1. Ah! never deem my love can change,
Or false that I could prove to be;
Nor time, nor space can e'er estrange
This heart, my own beloved, from thee.
Without thy smile life would be naught,
Thy presence 'tis alone can cheer;
Each look of thine with joy is fraught,
For ah! to me thou art so dear.
  Each look of thine with joy is fraught,
  For ah! to me thou art so dear!

2.
Tho' years may roll, tho' seas divide,
Alike shall live my faith and thine;
What ever good or ill betide,
I feel and know thy heart is mine.
Away with doubt, all fear be o'er!
For constant shall I ever prove;
Each hour I feel but more, and more
'Tis thee, and thee alone I love!
  Each hour I feel but more, and more
  'Tis thee, and thee alone I love!
