1. In the starry summer sky, 
When the moon dips o’er the lea, 
I’ve heard whispered, soft and low, 
There’s a star that shines for thee; 
And  I gaze with love and pride 
On the richly spangled gray, 
Till the fragrant ev’ning breeze 
Wafts my soul from earth away, 
	Till the fragrant ev’ning breeze 
	Wafts my soul from earth away.

2. By the ray of thy sweet smile
Through this dreary world I’ve strayed;
And new joys I’ve ever found
In its sunshine and its shade;
And when night her mantle casts,
Over land and over sea,
Then I gaze on yon bright star
And I know it shines for thee.
	Then I gaze on yon bright star
	And I know it shines for thee.

3. Thy words of love were o’er
As the sungilt clouds of hope;
Or the classic dreamy, harp,
With its low and silv’ry note,
And I know an angel’s smile
Is o’er thee full and free,
There’s a crown awaits thee there,
And a star that shines for thee,
	There’s a crown awaits thee there,
	And a star that shines for thee.
