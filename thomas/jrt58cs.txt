1. Brother Johnny Bull and cousin Vie,
  We welcome you three fold;
And extend the hand of friendship
  To your jolly seamen bold.
Twice you quarrelled with us, John,
  And twice you were well matched;
So let us live in harmony,
  Since we've become attach'd.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So blow the winds of morning,
  Our hearts and voices yield,
To give three rousing bully cheers,
  For Cyrus W-- Field!

2. Oh, let there be rejoicing,
  Bring out the fatted calf;
We'll toast our brother Johnny Bull
  In a glass of "arf and arf."
United let us ever be,
  For surely we are able,
Since we are joined together
  By the great Atlantic cable.

3. We've saved you an espense, John,
  We think you've had enough;
You needn't board our vessels, John,
  Any longer in the Gulf;
Respect the laws of nations, John,
  Don't give us cause to vex you,
If you do, we'll take the cable, John,
  Haul you over and annex you.

4. I've got a plan I'll tell to you,
  To cement our friendship fast,
'Twill unite the two great families,
  And thus forget the past,
For Buchanan is a bachelor,
  And I really think he'd orter
Take a trip to England's shore,
  And marry Queen Vic's daughter.
