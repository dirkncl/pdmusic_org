1. Ye midnight stars! 
My lady sleeps! 
Oh! weave a gentle dream; 
And gliding moon in azure deeps, 
Withhold no lovely beam! 
Look down, look down in vale and grove, 
And whisper if ye see 
A fairer vision than my love 
In any dreams that be!  

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Ye midnight stars! rain golden beams 
O’er silent land and sea! 
Oh! tell me if my lady dreams, 
One gentle thought of me.

2. Keep watch and ward 
O’er land and sun! 
And let no cares be near; 
Wake in her dreams the melody 
That rings from sphere to sphere. 
Oh! linger till the dewy light 
Of morning gems the skies; 
Then take O take, your envious flight 
When ope my lady’s eyes!
