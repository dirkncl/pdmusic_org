1.
O! I have a little sweetheart,
With brow like the drifted snow,
And cheeks like the early peach-bloom,
And locks like the sunset's glow;
But the voice of this little sweetheart,
I will not,-- I cannot compare
To aught on this planet we life on,
To aught in the ocean or air,
No! the voice of this little sweetheart,
Is to me beyond compare.

2.
O! I have a little sweetheart,
With step like the fleet Gazelle,
And form as fair as Poet-dreams
Of Fays, in the twilight dell;
But the Eyes of this little sweetheart,
I will not,-- I cannot compare
To aught on this planet we live on,
To aught in the ocean or air;
No! the eyes of this little sweetheart,
Is to me beyond compare.

3.
O! I have a little sweetheart,
And her love will make me strong
Thro' life to urge, and do what's right,
And as swiftly flee the wrong;
But me love for this little sweetheart,
I will not,-- cannot compare
To aught on this planet we live on,
To aught in the ocean or air,
No! my love for this little sweetheart,
Is to me beyond compare.
