1.
"Oh, loosen the snood that you wear, Janette,
Let me tangle a hand in your hair, my pet"
For the world to me had no daintier sight
Than your brown hair veiling your shoulders white,
As I tangled a hand in you hair, my pet.
It was brown with a golden gloss, Janette,
It was finer than silk of the floss, my pet,
'Twas beautiful mist falling down to your wrist,
'Twas a thing to be braided, and jeweled, and kiss'd--
'Twas the loviest hair in the world, my pet!

2.
Your eyes had a swimming glory, Janette,
Revealing the old, dear story, my pet,
They were grey, with that chasten'd tinge of the sky,
When the trout leaps quickest to snap the fly--
And they match'd with your golden hair, my pet.
Your lips-- but I have no words, Janette,
They were fresh as the twitter of birds, my pet,
When the spring is young, and the roses are wet
With dewdrops in each red bosom set,
And they suited your gold brown hair, my pet.

3.
You tangled my life in your hair, Janette,
'Twas a silken and golden snare, my pet,
But, so gentle the bondage, my soul did implore
The right to continue thy slave evermore,
With my fingers enmesh'd in you hair, my pet!
Thus ever I dream what you were, Janette,
With your lips, and your eyes, and your hair, my pet;
In the darkness of desolate years I moan,
And my tears fall bitterly over the stone
That covers your beautiful hair, my pet.
