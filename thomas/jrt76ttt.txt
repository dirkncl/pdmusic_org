1. Roquish little heads together,
Bending o'er the slate;
They are marking, one by one,
Till the merry game is done,
Stirring to keep staight
Noughts and crosses; this you know,
Is tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe.

2. Little fellow, speaking wisely,
Tells the other there;--
"If the game you want to win,
Mark right when you first begin,
This your only care;
Then, all right you'll surely go,
In tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe.

3.
They were playing by the fireside
All the evening long;
And I thought of Life's slate then,
When we mark, as boys and men,
Our path, right or wrong.
Mark right! straight thro' life we'll go,
And tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe, tit, tat, toe.
