1. Beautiful, Beautiful Highlands!
Above the rolling sea,
To breath the pure refreshing air,
Gives joy and health to me!
Sweetly at dewy-eyed morning,
The merry birds they sing;
And echoed thro' the mossy glens.
I hear their praises ring!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Beautiful, Beautiful Highlands!
Oh, how I love to roam
Adown thy wild and flow'ry paths
My charming Highland home!
My charming Highland home!
My charming Highland home!

2. Beautiful, Beautiful Highlands!
Sweet pleasure 'tis to me,
To mark the golden sunlight fall
Upon the mighty sea!
Bright is the glimmer of glory,
That dazzies in the sky;
To me it brings such happy dreams
Upon the mountains high!

3. Beautiful, Beautiful Highlands!
Upon the moonlit night,
I look from out thy leafy side
To watch the highland light!
Fondly its beacon is shining,
Like some fair rose in bloom;
To guide the sailor safely on
Amid the rising gloom!
