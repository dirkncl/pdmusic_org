1. We had a lovely Sister, 
A fair, sweet sister she, 
A being gentle good and pure 
As aught on earth could be; 
And bright th誕ngelic nature, 
Profusely to her giv地: 
It beams on us alas no more, 
She dwelleth now in Heav地.
	It beams on us alas no more, 
	She dwelleth now in Heav地.

2. Gone is that breathing loveliness
That calm and heav地ly brow,
Those eyes that spoke unearthly love
Are closed in silence now!
To check our mortal sorrowing,
Oh! vainly have we striv地
For her we mourn unceasingly
Who dwelleth now in Heav地,
	For her we mourn unceasingly
	Who dwelleth now in Heav地.

3. We miss her at the twilight hours,
When her seraphic soul,
Would muse on holy things and speak
Of heav地: its wish壇 for goal;
We look for her at starey night,
At morn, at noon, at ev地,
In vain we seek the vanish壇 one,
She dwelleth now in Heav地,
	In vain we seek the vanish壇 one,
	She dwelleth now in Heav地.
