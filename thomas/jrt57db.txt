1. Once again my native mountains,
Thro' thy wilds I stray,
Hear again thy warbling fountains,
Feel their cooling spray;
But the maid I fondly cherish'd
More than earthly store,
Like a new-blown flow'r has perish'd,--
Joy is mine no more.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Darling Bessie, Charming Bessie,
Now my Spirit bride,
Hover near me 'till they lay me
Gently by thy side.

2. When bright dreams of wealth and honor,
Urged me o'er the main,
Fondly then I gaz'd upon her,
Heard love's vows again;
"Back to thee" I cried "sweet Bessie
Soon I'll cross the wave,"
Now return'd, Alas! I find her,
In the silent grave.
