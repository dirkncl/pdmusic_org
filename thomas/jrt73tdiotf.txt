1. The dew is on the flow'r,
And the stars are o'er the lea;
Sweet love, with gentle pow'r,
Guides my longing heart to thee
While dream the radiant roses,
Thy soul from care reposes;
No orb on high discloses
A face so fair to me.

(CHORUS ad lib. sung after each verse)
The dew is on the flow'r (The dew is on the flow'r,)
And the stars are o'er the lea; (the stars are o'er the lea;)
Sweet love, with gentle pow'r,
Guides my longing heart to thee!

2. Oh dreams of joy be thine,
Till the night shall fade away;
One thought of me enshrine
In thy dreaming, ere the day
But when the hours of fleetness
Bring on the morn's completeness,
Thou gem of light and sweetness,
Thy loveliness display!
