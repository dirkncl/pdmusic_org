1. Come o'er the lake, love,
Stars are awake, love,
Fondly I linger to welcome thee, once more.
Birds are asleep, love,
Dark shadows creep, love,
Softly the breezes are sighing to the shore.
Moonlight is gleaming,
Wake from your dreaming,
What is the night, love, when you are from my side.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Come o'er the lake, love,
Stars are awake, love,
Gently we wander above the merry tide.
[CHORUS]
Come o'er the lake, love, (Come o'er the lake,)
Stars are awake, love, (Stars are awake,)
Gently we wander above the merry tide.


2. Fair as yon star, love,
Beams from a far, love,
Shine on my heart, love, and laugh away my care!
Sweet as the dew, love,
So sweet are you, love,
Wake from your slumber and charm the balmy air.
Fast fly the hours, love,
Soon wake the flow'rs, love,
Rise in your beauty and shame their gentle pride.
