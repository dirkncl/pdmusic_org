1. ’Twas when the hay was mown, Maggie, 
In the long years ago, 
And while the western sky was rich 
With sunset’s rosy glow, 
Then hand in hand close linked we pass’d 
The dewy ricks between,

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
When I was one and twenty, Mag, 
And you were seventeen.

2. Your voice was low and sweet, Maggie, 
Your wavy hair was brown, 
Your cheek was like the wild red rose 
That show’rs its petals down; 
Your eyes were like the blue speedwell 
With dewy moisture sheen,

3. The years have come and gone, Maggie, 
With sunshine and with shade, 
And silvered is the silken hair 
That o’er your shoulders strayed, 
In many  a soft and wayward tress, 
The fairest ever seen, 

4. Though gently changing time, Maggie, 
Has touched you in his flight, 
Your voice has still the old sweet tone, 
Your eyes the old love light, 
And years can never, never change, 
The heart you gave, I ween,
