1. There never bloomed a summer flow’r, 
Uncheered by dew and sun; 
There never lived a darksome hour, 
When joy could not be won! 
When joy could not be won! 
There never dawned a life so sad, 
Whose days were all of ill; 
O, pining one, belight and glad— 
Some heart will love thee still!— 
O, pining one, be light and glad— 
Some heart will love thee still!

2. Tho’ friends may one by one depart, 
And day may turn to night,— 
There waits for thee a gentle heart, 
To cheer thee with its light! 
To cheer thee with its light! 
There is no life unblest by love, 
Go seek it where we will; 
While stars are in the blue above— 
Some heart will love thee still!— 
While stars are in the blue above— 
Some heart will love thee still!
