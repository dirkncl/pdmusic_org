1. Where the sun, when daylight’s closing, 
Throws a mellow golden light, 
O’er yon snowy cottage, peeping 
Thro’ the vine and blossoms bright; 
There, amid its quiet beauty, 
By the ever flowing rill: 
Dwells our gentle village darling, 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Winsome Winnie, Winsome Winnie of the mill. 
Winsome Winnie, Winsome Winnie, 
Winsome Winnie, Winsome Winnie of the mill.

 2. Joyous as the Queen of Music, 
Warbling some enchanting lay; 
Fairer than the rosy dawning, 
Of a glorious summer day; 
Graceful as the welcome Flora, 
Decking forest, vale and hill, 
Is our gentle village darling, 

3. Always making others happy 
By some kindly word or deed: 
Cheering those that bow in sorrow, 
Helping thost that strive in needl; 
And the pray’rs her deeds awaken, 
May they e’er with hope’s fond thrill, 
Guide aright from ill and sorrow,
