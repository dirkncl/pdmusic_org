1. How oft I have thought, when in quiet reposing
On the green mossy banks of the wild Genesee,
When the mild summer-day in its beauty was closing,
O, how oft have I thought dearest Mary, of thee!
It was there that in childhood we wander'd together,
When the warm sun had kiss'd the night dew from the lea
And we cull'd the gay flow'rs that bespangled the heather,
While we roam'd on the banks of the wild Genesee!

2. And then in the dell where the lilies were growing,
And the clear sparkling waters came leaping along,
I was wild with delight, while thy soft voice was flowing
Thro' the soul thrilling cadence of exquisite song!
Thus we wander'd together from morning till even,
We were careless of our sorrow, our hearts danc'd with glee;
And then oft in my musings I wonder'd if heaven,
Were as bright as the banks of the wild Genesee!

3. My fancy wings back to the scenes of our childhood,
When the lawn is dedeck'd with the sweet flow'rs of May,
And I seem to be roaming thro' meadow and wildwood,
With my beautiful Mary, now far, far away!
There's a fountain of joy in my heart ever flowing,
That springs love, from mem'ries I cherish of thee,
And the bliss we have felt when the fond kiss bestowing,
On the green mossy banks of the wild Genesess!
