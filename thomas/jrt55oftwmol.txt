1. Oh fare thee well mine own love,
I'm going far from thee;
Oh think of me mine own love,
When I am on the sea.
It grieves my heart to leave thee,
Aye, more than tongue can tell;
Oh! fare thee well mine own love,
A thousand times farewell!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Fear not, I'll ne'er forget thee,
Too dear art thou to me,
And wheresoe'er IO rome love,
My heart is still with thee.

2. Thy heart is beating fast love,
Thy lips refuse to speak;
I find the tear drop stealing
Adown thy lovely cheek.
Farewell, this constant heart love,
Shall faithful still remain,
'Till happier hour restore thee
To these fon arms again.
