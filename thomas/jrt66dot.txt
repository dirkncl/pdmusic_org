1.
Dreaming of thee,
Only of thee,
Still by they side,
Longing to be,
Days wander by;
Joys they are flown;
Fondly I sigh, love,
Pining alone.
Summer is flying,
Come in thy bloom;
Roses are dying,
Cheer thou my gloom.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Dreaming of thee,
Only of thee,
Still by my side, love,
Longing to be.

CHORUS (May be omitted.) [sung after each REFRAIN]
Dreaming of thee, (Dreaming of thee,)
Only of thee, (Only of thee,)
Sill (Still) by thy side, love,
Longing to be.

2.
Star of my night,
When shall we meet?
When shall thy lips, love,
Sweet words repeat?
When shall our days
Peacefully glide?
Never to part, love,
Come to my side.
Summer is waking,
Roses will bloom;
Shadows are breaking,
Dawn on my gloom.
