1. When we met I never dreamed
Of the hour of pain so near;
When we met I little deemed
That my days would be so drear.
For you clasped my hand and said,
“We shall meet again, my own”;
But my heart must mourn you dead,
And my way must be alone.
For the seas were not so deep
As the guile within your heart,
And I weep, ah! yes, I weep,
That our days are now apart!
  And I weep, ah! yes, I weep,
  That our days are now apart!

2. Tho’ in life we meet no more,
And your love was but a dream,
Once again I walk the shore,
And your eyes in rapture beam!
There were tears, and you were gone!
Oh, the hopes that were to be;
But the waves that bore you on
Buried hope and joy for me.
For your love’s a faded rose
That I keep within my heart;
Tho’ we’ll meet when life shall close,
Yet our days must be apart;
  Tho’ we’ll meet when life shall close,
  Yet our days must be apart!
