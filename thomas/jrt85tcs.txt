1. Oh the candy stick stiped like a gay barbar’s pole, 
Was a luscious delight of my infantile soul, 
Ev’ry penny I earn’d in my little palm burn’d, 
Till away to the store on the corner I stole, 
For the candy stick striped like a gay barber’s pole.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh! a luscious delight of my infantile Soul, 
When away to the store on the corner I stole; 
Was the candy stick striped like a gay barber’s pole, 
The candy stick striped like a gay barber’s pole.

2. But what added a zest to that boyish delight,
Was my giving a longedfor and generous bite,
To another boy’s sis, and far sweeter the kiss,
’Mid the crumbs on her lips, I then furtively stole,
Than the candy stick striped like a gay barber’s pole.

3. And that sweet sis and I, now both ripend by years,
Oft live over the past with its joys and its tears,
As when day after day, Bobbie comes home from play,
With a smile in his eye, with delight in his soul,
And a candy stick striped like a gay barber’s pole.
