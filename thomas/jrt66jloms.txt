1.
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the raging billows roll,
While the tempest still is high:

[REFRAIN]
Hide me, O my Savior, hide
Till the storm of life be past,
Safe unto the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last,
receive, receive,
O receive my soul at last.

CHORUS
Hide me, O my Savior, hide
Till the storm of life be past,
Safe unto the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last,
receive, receive,
O receive my soul at last.

2.
Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee,
Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.

[REFRAIN]
All my trust on Thee is stay'd,
All my help from Thee I bring,
Cover my defenceless head,
With the shadow of Thy wing,
the shadow, the shadow,
With the shadow of Thy wing.

CHORUS
All my trust on Thee is stay'd,
All my help from Thee I bring,
Cover my defenceless head,
With the shadow of Thy wing,
the shadow, the shadow,
With the shadow of Thy wing.
