1. Waiting in the twilight, 
Will he, will he come? 
Whisper gentle zephyrs, 
In the leafy gloom. 
Tell me, chirping cricket, 
Tell me, grows it late? 
How my heart is longing 
While I sadly wait. 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Waiting in the twilight, 
Oh to see him now! 
Oh, to find his kisses 
Warm upon my kisses 
Warm upon my brow!

2. Gentle bird of ev’ning, 
Chide him for delay; 
Tell himthat I linger, 
Lead him on his way! 
Oh! to hear his footsteps, 
For the days are lone; 
Life is dark without thee, 
Come to me my own!
