1. Happy dreams, return again
To my aching heart once more,
With your merry laughing train
Calling back the days of yore,
When no sorrow waked the morrow,
When my soul was filled with Joy,
Now from sleep I only borrow,
What my waking thoughts destroy.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Happy dreams, return again
To my aching heart once more,
With your merry laughing train
Calling back the days of yore.

2. Bring the friend I loved and cherished,
Let me clasp him by the hand
As I did before he perished
Friendless in a foreign land.
Shew me, her to whom I plighted
Heart and hand, ah let me see
What she was ere she had blighted
Hope and Love no more for me.

3. Dear companions, long lost mother,
Now your shadowy forms I see,
Angel sister, darling mother,
Smiling sweetly down on me.
Kindred spirits long departed,
Struggling with this earthly chain,
Faint and weary, broken hearted,
Soon I'll be with you again.
