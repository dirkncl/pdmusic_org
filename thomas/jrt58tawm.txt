1. Thou art with me, ever with me, 
Lord of mercy, King of might! 
In the sunshine of the morning, 
In the darkness of the night; 
In sickness when the shadow 
Of the grave was on my brow, 
Thy word, the staff I leant on 
And in health my comfort now! 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Thou art with me ever with me 
Lord of mercy, King of night, 
In the sunshine of the morning, 
In the darkness of the night. 

QUARTETTE [sung after each verse]
Thou art with me, ever with me,
Lord of Mercy, King of might,
In the sunshine of the morning,
In the darkness of the night.

2. Thou art with me ever with me, 
And no evil I will fear, 
In the hour of my affliction 
Thou art by, my soul to cheer; 
Thro’ Thee my Lord and Saviour 
I am victor in the strife 
For Thy cross the portals open’d 
And made Death the gate of life!
