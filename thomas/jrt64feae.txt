1. If friendships grow cold and no hopefulness bring,
And love evanescent as snows in the spring,
O think of that love, from which nothing can sever,
And cling to the love, which abideth for ever!
When hearts from warm hearts, are all ruthlessly torn,
And, false ones have thrown off the mask they had worn,
O rest in the love, which betrayeth us never,
The love that was promised, for ever and ever!

2. When low we are bow'd in the anguish of grief,
And vainly we look all around for relief,
There's one Friend alone, who each soul can deliver,
O, look to that love, which abideth for ever!
When friendship and love long neglected arise,
And gaze with reproachfull, but pitiful eyes,
Remorse it were vain, there is nothing can sever,
From HIm who is faithful for ever and ever!
