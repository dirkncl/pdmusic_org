1. Home is home, however lowly;
Fenc'd around by many a spell;
If within its precincts holy,
Room be found for Love to dwell.

There is sure no spot on earth,
Wheresoe'er our steps may roam
Can out shine the smiling hearth
Of a tranquil happy home.

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Home is home, however lowly;
Fenc'd around by many a spell;
If within its precincts holy,
Room be found for Love to dwell.
Home is home! Home is home!

2. Home is home, however lowly;
Peaceful pleasures there abide;
Soothing thoughts and visions holy,
Cluster 'round our own fireside.

Though the outer world be dark,
And its ocean lash'd to foam,
Safe within its shelt'ring ark
All is bright and calm at home.
