1. Oh! let me shed one silent tear, 
To ease my sorrowing heart from pain,— 
One tribute to the friends so dear, 
And then I will be brave again! 
And if I seem to feel my grief, 
Above the battle’s fearful care, 
Remember tears can give relief, 
And I have dear friends fighting there!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Oh, let me shed one silent tear, 
To ease my sorrowing heart from pain,— 
One tribute to the friends so dear; 
And then I will be brave again!

2. Oh, deem me not of craven heart, 
Nor think I’ve lost the patriot’s pride: 
Because I have not gain’d the art, 
My tears for friendship yet to hide: 
I love my Country, while I weep, 
I pray her Sons may all things dare,— 
But still the mem’ry will not sleep, 
That I have dear friends fighting there!

3. Tho’ mine may be sad hours of grief, 
My Country’s cause shall be my own,— 
In her success I’ll find relief, 
And stifle ev’ry selfish moan; 
And I will learn to watch and wait, 
And seeking strength the end to bear, 
I’ll trust, with Providence, the fate 
Of all my dear friends fighting there!
