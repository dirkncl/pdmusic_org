1. There, the hope that blooms for ever, 
Here, the sweetest joys of life; 
There, the bliss that fails us never, 
Here, a refuge from the strife. 
Stars in sweet communion shining, 
Linked in kindness and in love; 
Joy amid our days declining, 
Home below and Heav地 above! 

[CHORUS sung after each verse]
Home below and Heav地 above! 
Home below and Heav地 above!

2. Here, the bright and loving faces, 
There, our dear ones gone before; 
Here, the sweet and fond embraces, 
There, our rest for evermore. 
Precious gift to weary mortals, 
Tokens of our Father痴 love; 
Endless joy within you portals, 
Home below and Heav地 above!
