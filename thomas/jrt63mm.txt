1. 
How wildly glad, yet sweetly sad, 
Come back the darling days of yore; 
When first I knew how tried and true, 
Could be the heart of Maudie Moore; 
The year was young, the robins sung 
Of joy around my cottage door, 
And nature bright with love and light, 
Stole half the smiles of Maudie Moore.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O Maudie Moore! the years of yore 
Come thronging back my mem’ry o’er, 
I would not give one wish to live, 
Since thou hast left me, Maudie Moore.

2. 
As oft we strayed adown the glade, 
The sunset stole her blush of bloom, 
The flowers wild looked up and smiled, 
And filled the air with rich perfume, 
And side by side at eventide, 
We walked the river’s shining shore; 
The breath of God hung o’er the sad, 
And kissed the cheek of Maudie Moore.

3. 
But she is gone! at darkor dawn, 
When winds and waters howl and hum, 
I watch and wait till it is late, 
But Maudie never more will come; 
At dawn of day she passed away, 
To walk another shining shore; 
And oft from sleep I wake and weep, 
To find I’ve lost sweet Maudie Moore.
