1. Oh! I’m not myself at all, 
Molly dear, Molly dear, 
I’m not myself at all. 
Nothing caring, nothing knowing, 
’Tis after you I’m going, 
Faith your shadow ’tis I’m growing, 
Molly dear, Molly dear, 
And ’tis not myself at all. 
Th’other day I went confessin’, 
And I ask’d the father’s blessin’, 
But says I, “don’t give me one entirely, 
For I fretted so last year, 
But the half o’ me is here, 
So give the other half to Molly Brierly; 
Oh! I’m not myself at all.

2. Oh! I’m not myself at all,
Molly dear, Molly dear,
My appetite’s so small.
I once could pick a goose,
But my buttons is no use,
Faith my tightest coat is loose,
Molly dear, Molly dear,
And I’m not myself at all.
If thus it is I waste,
You’d better dear make haste
Before your lover’s gone away entirely;
If you don't soon change your mind
Not a bit o’ me you’ll find,
And what ’ud you think o’ thaf Molly Brierly?
Oh! I’m not myself at all.

3. Oh! my shadow on the wall, 
Molly dear, Molly dear,
Isn’t like myself at all.
For I’ve got so very thin,
Myself says ’tis n’t him,
But that purty girl so slim
Molly dear, Molly dear,
And I’m not myself at all.
If thus I smaller grew,
All fretting dear for you,
’Tis you should make me up the deficiency
So just let Father Teaf
Make you my better half,
And you will not the wurse of the addition be;
Oh! I’m no myself at all.

4. I’ll be not myself at all
Molly dear, Molly dear,
’Till you my own I call,
Since a change o’er me there came,
Sure you might change your name,
And ’twould just come to the same
Molly dear, Molly dear,
Oh! ’twould just come to the same.
For if you and I were one, 
All confusion would be gone,
And ’twould simplify the matter entirely,
And twould save us so much bother,
When we’d both be one another,
So listen now to rayson Molly Brierly;
Oh! I’m not myself at all.
