1. The young stars are glowing,
Their clear light bestowing!
Their radiance fills the calm, clear summer night!
Come forth, like a fairy,
So blithesome and airy,
And ramble in their soft and mystic light.

[REFRAIN repeat after each verse]
Come, come, come, love, come!
Come, ere the night-torches pale;
Oh come, in thy beauty,
Thou marvel of duty,
Dear Annie, dear Annie of the Vale.

CHORUS [repeat after each REFRAIN]
Come, come, come, love, come!
Come, ere the night-torches pale;
Oh come, in thy beauty,
Thou marvel of duty,
Dear Annie, dear Annie of the Vale.

2. The world we inherit
Is charm'd by thy spirit,
As radiant as the mild, warm summer ray!
The watchdog is snarling,
For fear, Annie, darling,
His beautiful young friend I'd steal away!
