1. Farewell! Farewell!
The dream of love is o'er,
Farewell! Ah! Farewell!
I ne'er shall see thee more,
Never again to hear thy loved voice--
Music that with thee dies--
Ah! Feel its spell,
And hold thy soft hand--
Gaze in thy melting eyes.
Farewell! Farewell!
The dream of love is o'er,
Farewell! Ah! Farewell!
I ne'er shall see thee more.

2. Farewell! Farewell!
The dream of love is o'er,
Farewell! Ah! Farewell!
I ne'er shall see thee more,
Sadly I turn to scenes of the past
Blessings and hope depart Ah!
When thee I learned to cherish and love,
Parting will break my heart.
Farewell! Farewell!
The dream of love is o'er,
Farewell! Ah! Farewell!
I ne'er shall see thee more.
