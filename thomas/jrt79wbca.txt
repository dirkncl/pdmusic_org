1. When skies were gloomy overhead, 
I heard the robin sing; 
It seem’d to have no doubt nor dread, 
That morn in early spring. 
And this is what it warbled there 
Amid the falling rain; 
“Tho’ skies be dark,  they’ll soon  be fair, 
When blossoms come again! 
Tho’ skies be dark, they’ll soon be fair, 
When blossoms come again!”

2. So when our skies are overcast, 
My heart, can we forget 
Our loving dreams of glory past? 
The joys that we have met? 
Oh, like that trusting birdling sweet, 
We’ll learn to bear our pain; 
For life, to us, will be complete, 
When blossoms come again! 
For life to us will be complete 
When blossoms come again!
