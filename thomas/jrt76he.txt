1. In the hour I first beheld thee,
Soft thy kindly glances fell.
And my heart bowed down before thee,
As beneath a magic spell.
Since that time like some sweet plantom,
In my home thy form doth rise,
And wheree'er my sad gaze wanders,
There I meet thy haunting eyes!
  And wheree'er my sad gaze wanders,
  There I meet thy haunting eyes!
Thy haunting eyes! Thy haunting eyes!


2. Oh, these eyes! their lovely shadow
Stole the light of life away.
And my heart in languid dreaming
Idly pines from day to day.
Vain the evening's dewy coolness,
Vain the calm of midnight skies;
E'en with darkness closing round me,
Still I see those haunting eyes!
  E'en with darkness closing round me,
  Still I see those haunting eyes!
Those haunting eyes! Those haunting eyes!
