Blessed be the Lord God, 
the Lord God of Israel; 
For he hath visited 
and redeemed his people; 
And hath raised up 
a mighty salvation for us, 
in the house of his servant David; 
As he spake by the mouth 
of his holy prophets, 
which have been since 
the world began; 
that we should be saved 
from our enemies, 
and from the hand 
of all that hate us. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Ghost; 
As it was in the beginning; 
is now and ever shall be, 
World without end. 
Amen, Amen.
