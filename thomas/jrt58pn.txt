1. Pretty Nelly, winsome Nelly, 
Pretty Nelly’s bright and gay, 
Ev’ry light of joy around her, 
Beaming like a summer day; 
We are poor, both I and Nelly, 
Neither land nor gold have we, 
But she says

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
I am her treasure,— 
And she’s all the world to me.

2. Pretty Nelly, guileless Nelly, 
Pretty Nelly’s ever wild, 
Lovely as a poet’s dreaming 
Simple as a very child; 
Let the wealthy boast their splendor, 
Still a greater gift have we, 
For she says

3. Pretty Nelly, faithful Nelly, 
Pretty Nelly’s true as gold, 
With a heart as pure as ever 
Beat within a mortal mould; 
Are we poor then, I and Nelly? 
No! but rich as rich can be, 
For I know
