[CLARA]
1. Love once met a little maiden,
While he tripped along;
Oh, her heart with joy was laden,
Light and free her song;
"Will you come," said Love so gaily,
"To my bow'r so gay?"
"'Neath the roses wand'ring daily,
Care shall never stray!"
But the little maiden smiling,
Whispered, "no! no! no!"

2. Now this maiden grew so lonely,
In the years that came;
Life but gave her freedom only,
Freedom soon grew tame:
Oft she wandered o'er the meadow,
Where sweet Love she met;
Nor in sunshine, nor in shadow,
Has Love found her yet!
So the little maiden sighing,
Whispers, wiser grown:
"Come, sweet Love, the days are flying!
Leave me not alone!"
