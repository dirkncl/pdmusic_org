1. The fields of home, the merry fields,
Where waved the golden corn:
What joy their glowing mem'ry yields,
'Twas here that I was born!
Along their side the river wound
With sweet and ripling flow,
And near it was the old playground
We cherished years ago.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
The fields of home the merry fields
Where waved the golden corn,
What joy their glowing mem'ry yields,
Twas here that I was born!

2. The fields of home-- I roved them o'er
With gentle ones now gone:
When life had blissful hopes in store,
And pleasure round us shone.
THe rosy days! how fast they fled!
Alas! I sadly roam;
And many were the fears I shed
To leave the fields of home.

3. The fields of home, where oft I heard
The farmer's cheery song,
As gay as voice of morning bird,
While sped the plough along.
My bosom fondly yearns to see
Each blooming hill and plain.
To lie beneath some balmy free
And be a child again.
