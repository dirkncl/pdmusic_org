1. Down by the river, 
Dawns her sweet face 
Where she has wander’d, 
Flow’rs you may trace 
Sunbeams and blossoms— 
Music of birds 
Live in her laughter, 
Wake in her words. 
Come to me darling, 
Never to part. 
Rose of the Valley, 
Bloom  in my heart.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Come to me darling, 
Never to part. 
Rose of the Valley, 
Bloom in my heart!

2. Stars of the midnight, 
Breeze of the sea 
Tell is my loved one’s 
Dreaming of me. 
Fold her in slumber, 
Balmy and fair 
Watch o’er her pillow, 
Shield her from care. 
Come to me darling, 
Never to part. 
Rose of  the Valley, 
Bloom in my heart.
