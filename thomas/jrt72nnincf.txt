1. No, No, I never can forget 
The heart so dear to mw; 
Whate’er may be thy lot, or mine, 
I will be true to thee. 
For love like thine, unselfish proved, 
Of life becomes a part, 
In weal, or woe thou still art Queen, 
To reign within my heart.

2. The day will never come to us, 
When heart from heart shall roam, 
Without thee, life would be unrest, 
With thee tis love and home. 
Then cease thy doubting and thy fears, 
Love’s song that we now sing, 
Shall ever vibrate in our hearts, 
And pleasant music bring.

3. Though time may steal thy silken locks, 
May dim thy soullit eyes, 
May leave his footprints on thy cheek, 
My spirit still replies: 
No, No, I never can forget 
The heart so dear to me, 
While time rolls on, each day shall find 
My soul still true to thee.
