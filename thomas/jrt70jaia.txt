[SOPRANO (SOLO)]
Just as I am, without one plea 
But that Thy blood was shed for me, 
And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee, 
O Lamb of God I come. 
Just as I am, and waiting not 
To rid my soul of one dark blot, 
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
O Lamb of God I come.

[QUARTETTE] 
Just as I am, though toss’d about 
With many a conflict, many a doubt, 
With fears within, and foes without, 
O Lamb of God, I come. 
Just as I am— poor, wretched blind, 
Sight, riches, healing of the mind, 
Yes, all I need, in Thee to find, 
O Lamb of God, I come. 

[BASS SOLO]
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, 
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
Because Thy promise I believe, 
O Lamb of God, I come. 

[QUARTETTE]
Just as I am, Thy love unknown 
Has broken ev’ry barrier down; 
Now to be Thine, yes Thine alone, 
O Lamb of God, I come.
