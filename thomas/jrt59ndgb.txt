1.
Nelly dear I'm going to leave you,
Nelly dear, good bye!
Smile my love nor let it grieve you
Nelly dear, good bye!
Though away I'm doomed to wander
O'er the stormy sea,
Yes my heart will fondly ponder,
Nelly dear on thee.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Nelly dear I'm going to leave you,
Nelly dear good bye.
Smile my love and let it grieve you
Nelly dear, good bye.

2.
Nelly though for years we sever,
Though we part in pain,
Though in this world we may never
Meet or speark again,
Yet thy parting glance shall cheer me
On the ocean foam,
And in dreams I'll still be near thee,
In thy cottage home.

3.
May be 'tis the last I'm telling,
Nelly dear adieu!
Our brave hawk's white-sails are swelling
O'er the waters blue.
In the far land of the stranger
There I soon shall be,
Seeking gold and braving danger,
Nelly dear for thee.
