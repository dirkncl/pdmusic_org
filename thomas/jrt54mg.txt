1. When the early flow'rs were springing
  O'er the grassy lea,
And the happy birds with singing
  Wildest melody;
In the leafy woods I met her,
  Bright as blooming May;
This sad heart can ne'er forget her,--
  Lovely Mary Gray.

CHORUS [sung twice after each verse]
Now mine eyes ne'er cease their weeping,
  All the livelong day;
She in death's cold arms is sleeping,
  Lovely Mary Gray.

2. Beauteous as the rosy moring
  Of a summer day;
She without one word of warning
  Stole my heart away;
All was calm and bright and glowing,
  Like a blissful dream,
And our hearts with love o'erflowing,
  As on soul did seem.

3. When the autumn winds were sighing
  Through each forest tree,
And the gentle flow'rs were lying,
  Withered on the lea;
She whom I shall love forever,
  Faded from my sight;
Spring returns, but she will never,--
  Day is turned to night.
