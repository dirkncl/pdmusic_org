1. They say that the Year is old and gray, 
That his eyes are dim with sorrow; 
But what care we, though he pass away?— 
For the New Year comes tomorrow. 
No sighs have we for the roses fled, 
No tears for the vanished Summer; 
Fresh flowers spring where the old are dead, 
To welcome the glad newcomer.

2. He brings us a gift from the beautiful land 
We see in our rosy dreaming, 
Where the wonderful castles of fancy stand 
In magiccal sunshine gleaming. 
Then sing, young hearts that are full of cheer, 
With never a thought of sorrow; 
The Old goes out, but the glad Young Year 
Comes merrily in tomorrow.
