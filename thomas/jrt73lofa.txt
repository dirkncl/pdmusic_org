1.
When the quiet stars are gleaming,
In the deep and lovely blue,
Then my heart is fondly dreaming,--
Dreaming of the loved and true.
Once again they linger near me,
Bringing back life's joyful May;
One by one, to bless and cheer me,
Come the loved one far away.

2.
Still my heart, in hope and gladness,
Whispers o'er each loving name;
While it wonders oft, in sadness,
If it still is loved the same.
Like the breath of roses sighing,
Olden mem'ries round me stray;
Like sweet music, softly dying,
Call the lov'd ones far away.

3.
Tho' I nevermore may meet them,
As we met in early years,
Yet in dreams I still may greet them,
And their love my pathway cheers.
Longing, sighing to caress them,
Thinking of them, day by day,
With my latest breath I'll bless them,
Bless the lov'd ones far away.
