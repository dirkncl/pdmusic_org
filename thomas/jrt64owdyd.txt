1. Oh! why did you die when the flowers were springing, 
And winter’s wild tempests had vanished away; 
When the swallow was come and the sweet lark was singing, 
From the morn to the eve of the beautiful day? 
Oh! why did you go when the summer was coming, 
And the heather was blue as your own sunny eye; 
When the bee on the blossom was drowsily humming, 
Mavourneen! Mavourneen! Oh! why did you die?

2. Achora Machree you are ever before me, 
I scarce see the heavens to which you are gone; 
So dark are the clouds of despair which lie o’er me, 
Oh! pray for me, pray at the Mighty One’s throne: 
Oh! plead that the chain of my bondage may sever, 
That to thee, and our Father, my freed soul may fly; 
Or the cry of my spirit for ever and ever, 
Shall be Oh! Mavourneen! Oh! why did you die?
