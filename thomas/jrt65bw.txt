1.Beautiful Wales,
Beautiful Wales!
Dear to my heart ev'ry mem'ry of thine;
Proud land of Bards!
Storied thy vales,
Breathing to me in their language divine.
Childhood and all its bright visions return,
Friendships long sever'd in radiance burn,
Round thee still cluster the hopes of my soul,
True as thy waves in melody roll.
Beautiful Wales.
Beautiful Wales.

2. Beautiful Wales,
Beautiful Wales!
Oft in my dreams I have wander'd to thee,--
Roam'd o'er thy hills,--
Breath'd thy soft gales,
Kiss'd by thy golden light, far o'er the sea.
Land where my earliest joys had their birth,
Land of my lov'd ones the dearest on earth,
When the last hours of my being shall close,
On thy fair bosom thy son would repose!
Beautiful Wales.
Beautiful Wales.
