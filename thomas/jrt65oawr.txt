1. Only a withered rose 
It seems to thee, 
Yet day by day it grows 
Dearer to me, 
I know its beauty fled 
Long months ago, 
I know its petals red 
Turn’d white as snow 
Yet dear it is to me 
As when it came. 
Fresh dearest one from thee, 
Breathing thy name. 

2. I know its fragrance died 
Long, long ago. 
I know that flow’rs beside 
More beauteous grow 
Yet I still cherish this, 
One gift from thee 
Symbol of earthly bliss 
Thy love for me 
Oh! though the rose must fade 
And bloom decay 
Our love shall e’er be made 
Brighter each day.
