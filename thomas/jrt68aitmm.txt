1. Among the meadows straying, a-straying, a-straying,
The birds were long delaying,
The sun was going down.
While doves were softly cooing,
A youth was fondly wooing,
A pretty maid pursuing
In spite of pout and frown.
Among the meadows straying, a-straying, a-straying,
O! winning comes of wooing,
All in the merry, merry, May!

2. Among the meadows straying, a-straying, a-straying,
Before the year's decaying,
Her lips had whisper'd "Yes"!
While buttercups were springing,
And birds were gaily singing,
The village bells were ringing,
For whom, I think, you'll guess!
Among the meadows straying, a-straying, a-straying,
O! Wedding bells are sweetest,
All in the merry, merry, May!
