1. Before the days of sadness come,
Our hearts should happy be,
For who would choose in gloom to roam
That now from care is free!
As autumn leaves are wither'd
When coldness reigns around,
As autumn leaves are scatter'd
And fall upon the ground;
[REFRAIN]
So sorrow casts a gloominess
Upon the fairest fare,
And grief and care the loveliness
From beauty's cheek erase,
And grief and care the loveliness
From beauty's cheek erase,
From beauty's cheek erase.

2. As silent is the gleesome bird
When cheerful day is gone,
As sounds thro' woods and fields afar,
The nightbird's plaintive tone;
As flowers, when of light bereft,
In [pile?-]ness fade away,
And as they, white and odorless,
Their dark abode [betray?];
[REFRAIN]
As sorrow casts a gloominess
Upon the fairest face,
And grief and care the loveliness
From beauty's cheek erase,
And grief and care the loveliness
From beauty's cheek erase,
From beauty's cheek erase.
