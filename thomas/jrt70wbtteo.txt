1. We'll be true to each other, tho' Fate has now parted
Two spirits that yearn with devotion and love;
We will shew the hard world that we both are strong-hearted,
That the wings of the eagle can nurture the dove.
Perhaps it is well that our faith and affection
Are tried in our youth by a lingering test;
But if both of us love by the soul's free selection,
We'll be true to each other and hope for the rest
  We'll be true to each other and hope for the rest.

2. Let us chafe not unwisely by rudely defying
The doubts and denials that echo in vain;
Like the ship in the stream on her anchor relying,
We'll live on our truth till the tide turns again.
We are parted, but trust me it is not forever,
Our vows breath'd in earnest will surely be blest;
So we'll work and we'll wait with Love's fervent endeavour,
Be true to each other, and hope for the rest,
  Be true to each other, and hope for the rest.
