1. Only of thee are my thoughts in the day;
Only of thee, ev'ry dream;
Thou art to me sweeter far than the May,--
Brighter than eve's silv'ry beam!
Visions of thee in my hours of delight,
Bring to my bosom repose; 
Ah! Brightest and fairest of flow'rs to my sight,
Bloom in my heart, lovely rose!
  Bloom in my heart, lovely rose!


2. Only of thee, ev'ry bird of the vale
Swwetly reminds me, my own!
Only of thee, doth the fair summer gale
Speak to my fond heart alone;
Only of thee do the stars in the sky
Whisper at day's gentle close;
Ah! Only of thee,-- while the moments go by,
Bloom in my heart, lovely rose!
  Bloom in my heart, lovely rose!
