1. My barque stood by with waiting sail. 
She came with tearful eye. 
And press’d to mine her cheek so pals, 
And whisper’d: “Love, goodbye!” 
One last embrace, and far behind 
I left the lovelit shore; 
Yet still I heard, upon the wind, 
The voice of Effie Moore.

CHORUS 1
The voice of Effie Moore, 
Of darling Effie Moore, 
Came out to me upon the sea, 
The voice of Effie Moore.

2. All dark with storm the heavens hung. 
The sea upon me press’d; 
The name of God was on each tongue, 
And fear in ev’ry breast. 
When lo! the sky again was fair 
And smiling as before, 
While on the air I heard in pray’r 
The voice of  Effie Moore.

CHORUS 2
The voice of Effie Moore, 
Of darling Effie Moore,
Upon the air I heard in pray’r 
The voice of Effie Moore.

3. At length the weary year was past, 
And all my waiting o’er; 
And with a happy heart, at last 
I sail’d for home once more; 
And as my barque with joy drew near. 
I saw her on the shore, 
And heard, in words of welcome dear, 
The voice of Effie Moore.

CHORUS 3
The voice of Effie Moore, 
Of darling Effie Moore,
O! life is dear while I can hear 
The voice of Effie Moore.
