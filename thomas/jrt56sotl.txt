1. Some one to love in this wide world of sorrow, 
Some one whose smile will efface the sad tear; 
Some one to welcome the light of tomorrow, 
Some one to share it when sunshine is here. 
Oh, the world is a desert amid all its pleasures, 
And life seems bereft of the only true zest, 
If we fail in posessing with all its proud treasures 
The best of all blessings: some dear kindred breast!   

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Some one to love in this wide world of sorrow, 
Some one whose smile will efface the sad tear; 
Some one to welcome the light of tomorrow, 
Some one to share it when sunshine is here.

2. Some one to love whose affection will cherish, 
The sweet bud of hope when ’tis blighted with care; 
Some faithful heart that will ne’er let it perish 
By sinking forever in depths of despair. 
’Tis an angelic radiance, a beacon to guide us, 
Resending these lamps that are shining above 
’Tis a guardian from heaven, a light to decide us, 
Teaching us wisdom in lessons of love!
