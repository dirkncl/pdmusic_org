1. When the evening shades are falling, 
Dreams of other days appear; 
Gentle voices sweetly calling, 
Wake the past so fond and dear. 
Loving hands again caress me, 
Loving eyes look in mine own; 
Oh the pleasant tho’ts that bless me, 
While my days are dark and lone! 

2. When the evening shades are falling, 
Childhood’s days are mine once more; 
Echoes on my heart are calling, 
Every joy they now restore. 
So, when life’s hour is declining, 
And our cares and joys depart, 
Lovely stars of joy are shining, 
In the twilight of the heart.
