1. There’s a home for those who seekit,— 
Blessed home of love and light! 
There’s a rest for all our bur dens, 
In those regions calm and bright! 
By the still and pleasant waters 
O! I dearly long to stray; 
Lead me, gentle Saviour, lead me 
To the light of perfect day. 

QUARTET (ad lib.) [sung after each verse]]
There’s a home for those who seek it, 
Blessed home of love and light; 
There’s a rest for all our burdens 
In those regions calm and bright, 
In those regions calm and bright.

2. There’s a home for those who seek it, 
In our Father’s house above, 
Where the weary soul is welcome, 
And we meet in purest love! 
Far beyond the darksome river 
And the earth and all its fears, 
There’s a blessed home of glory 
Thro’ the bright eternal years.
