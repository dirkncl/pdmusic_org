1. Far away but not forgotten,
Dear one with the hazel eyes,
Mem'ry fond is ever busy,
Giving some sweet our prise,
Evermore thy tender glances,
Meet me as in moments gone.
And I hear thy loving whispers,
As at bygone eve and morn.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Far away but not forgotten (but not forgotten,),
For I wish that you were here;
Loving whispers, tender glances,
Darling make you doubly dear.

2. Far away but not forgotten,
And my lips in vain beseech,
For the roses of the summer,
That have gone beyond my reach,
Are you coming back to love me,
With a love as pure as gold,
Then the skies shall shine above me,
Brighter than they did of old.

3. Far away but not forgotten,
Absent and yet ever near,
Come my darling come and let me,
Whispering something in your ear,
Other lips must not repeat it,
Other ears are not to hear,
It is only for my darling,
For my darling and my dear.
