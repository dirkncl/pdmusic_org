[CHORUS]
Earth, tell it out abroad!
The Passover of gladness,
The Passover of God!
From death to life eternal,
From this world to the sky,
Our Christ hath brought us over,
With hymns of victory.

[Soprano Solo]
Our hearts be pure from evil,
That we may see a-right,
The Lord in rays eternal
Of resurrection light;
And list'ning to his accents,
May hear so calm and plain
His own "all hail!: and hearing,
May raise the victor's strain,
May raise the victor's strain.

[CHORUS]
Now let the heav'ns be joyful!
Let earth her song begin!
Let the round world keep triumph,
And all that is therein!
Invisible and visible
Their notes let all things blend,
For Christ the Lord hath risen,
Our joy that hath no end,
Our joy that hath no end.
