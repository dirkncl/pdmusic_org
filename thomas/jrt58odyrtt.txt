1. Oh! don’t you remember the time 
When you gathered the cowslips for me. 
And I trembled to see you upclimb 
To the nest in the old apple tree? 
Oh! dont you remember the time 
When we had a great festival day, 
And you taught me your earliest rhyme 
And crowned me the Queen of the May. 
Yes I feel that you cannot forget. 
From your lips I need ask no reply; 
For the light of old happiness yet 
Beams out like a star from your eye.

2. Oh! don’t you remember the time 
When after an absence of years; 
We met ’neath the shade of the time, 
And you whisper’d your hopes and your fears? 
And dont you remember the time 
When we sat by the river alone 
And we heard the bells distantly chime, 
And you said but  that time is all gone. 
And I see that you do not forget. 
From you lips I need ask no reply 
For the light of old happiness yet 
Shines out like a star from your eye.
