1. Nellie wilt thou be my bride, 
And leave a home of gladness, 
To dwell with me whate’er betide 
And cheer my heart's lone sadness? 
There are  no gifts that I may own 
But nature’s sweet bestowing 
Yet cheer’d by thee where weeds have grown 
Sweet flowers may be growing. Oh... 

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Nellie wilt thou be my bride 
And leave a home of gladness 
To dwell with me whate’er betide 
And cheer my heart’s lone sadness?

2. Nellie wilt thou be me bride, 
And all my fears dispelling, 
Turn from the home of gilded pride 
To bless a lowly dwelling 
Love shall be ours whate’er our lot 
’Till at the grave we sever 
To meet again where death is not 
And love shall last forever. Oh...
