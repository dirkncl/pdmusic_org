1.
Though our way is dark and dreary,
And we toil from day to day,
While the heart is sad and weary,
At our home there shines a ray.

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Kindly words and smiling faces,
Gentle voices as of yore,
Loving kisses and embraces
Ever wait us at the door.

CHORUS [sung after each REFRAIN]
Kindly words and smiling faces,
Gentle voices as of yore,
Loving kisses and embraces
Ever wait us at the door.

2.
Here we turn when all forsake us--
Here we never look in vain,
For the soothing tones that wake us
Back to joy and peace again.

3.
Though we err yet in our sadness,
Here's a shelter from the storm,
Just as in our days of gladness,
Here the hearts are true and warm.
