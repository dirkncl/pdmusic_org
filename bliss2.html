<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;The following was written by (the <a href="root-gf.html">composer</a>) George Frederick Root (1820-1895) from his book <b>The Story of a Musical Life,</b> An Autobiography, published in Cincinnati by The John Church Co., in 1891, from Chapter XII, concerning events from 1861-1870, pages 138-139.</p></FONT>

<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been some time in 1863 that I received a<br>
letter from somewhere in Pennsylvania that interested us<br>
all very much.  It accompanied the manuscript of a song.<br>
Would we give the writer a flute for it, was the substance<br>
of the letter, expressed in a quaint and original way, and in<br>
beautiful handwriting.  We were on the lookout for bright men,<br>
and we felt sure that here was one.  The song needed some revising,<br>
but we took it and and sent him a flute.  After<br>
a while he wrote again, saying he would like to come out to<br>
Chicago if he could find anything to do.  He gave an account<br>
of his accomplishments in his droll way, and we all became<br>
much interested in having him come.  I think it was he who<br>
finally made the plan that was agreed upon, namely:  He<br>
would go as our representative to the towns that would<br>
naturally be tributary to Chicago, and hold conventions, or<br>
give concerts, or do, something musical, whenever he could<br>
get the opportunity, (his wife being his accompanist,) and so<br>
turn people's attention to us for whatever they might want<br>
in the way of music.  For this service we guarenteed him a<br>
certain annual sum.  If the proceeds of his concerts and<br>
conventions did not match that amount we were to make it<br>
up.  While engaged in this work he was constantly sending<br>
in words and music of various kinds for revision and correc-<br>
tion.  It was not long before I saw here was a man who<br>
had a "call" especially as a poet.  His musical training and<br>
experiences were too limited to permit safe flights on his part<br>
beyond simlpe harmonies, although it was easily seen that<br>
he had a natural vein of true melody.  What a wonderful use<br>
his songs have performed now for more than a score of years.<br>
I presume it is seen that I am writing of the beloved and<br>
lamented P. P. Bliss.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Moody, from being a simple, hard working<br>
but devoted city missionary in Chicago, began to come to<br>
the front as an evangelist, Mr. Bliss's songs, and some that I<br>
wrote, were of much use to him.  He used to say of my first<br>
gospel song, "Come to the Savior," that is was the "Rally<br>
Round the Flag" of the gospel work.  It was indeed stirring<br>
when Mr. Bliss's magnificent voice gave it forth, for it then<br>
came from a heart and soul in deepest sympathy with the<br>
work to which he ultimately devoted himself--the writing<br>
and singing of gospel songs.  He remained with us until the<br>
breaking up caused by the great fire, and we published all<br>
the songs and other music that he wrote up to that time.
