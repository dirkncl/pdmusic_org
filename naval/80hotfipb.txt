1. Blue and crimson and white it shines,
Over the steeltipped serried lines;
The colors before us fly;
But more than the flag is passing by.
Sea fights and land fights grim and great,
Fought to make and to save the state;—
Weary marches, and sinking ships;
Cheers of victory on dying lips.

CHORUS 1
Hats off! Hats off! Hats off!
The flag, the flag is passing by,
Along the street there comes
A blaze of bugles, a ruffle of drums,
A flash of color beneath the sky,
Hats off! Hats off! Hats off!
The flag is passing by.

2. Days of plenty and days of peace;
March of a strong land’s swiftincrease;
Equal justise, right and law,
Stately honor and rev’rend awe.
Sign of a nation great and strong,
To ward her people from foreign wrong;
Pride and glory and honor all,
Live in the colors, to stand or fall.

CHORUS 2
Hats off! Hats off! Hats off!
The flag, the flag is passing by,
Along the street there comes
A blaze of bugles, a ruffle of drums,
And loyal hearts are beating high,
Hats off! Hats off! Hats off!
The flag is passing by.
