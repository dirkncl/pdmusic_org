1. Shades of ev’ning close not o’er us, 
Leave our lonely Bark awhile! 
Morn alas will not restore us, 
Yonder dim and distant Isle; 
Still my fancy can discover, 
Sunny spot where friends may dwell; 
Darkness shadows round us hover, 
Isle of Beauty, Fare thee well! 

2. ’Tis the hour when happy faces, 
Smile around the taper’s light; 
Who will fill our vacant places! 
Who will sing our songs to night! 
Through the mist that floats above us 
Faintly sounds the Vesper bell, 
Like a voice from those who love us, 
Breathing fondly “Fare thee well”!

3. When the waves are round the breaking, 
As I pass the dock alone, 
And my eye in vain is seeking 
Some green leaf to rest upon, 
What would I not give to wander, 
Where my old companions dwell; 
Absence makes the heart grow founder, 
Isle of Beauty, Fare thee well!
