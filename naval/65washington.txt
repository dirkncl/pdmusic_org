1. Oppression's cloud, with thunderings loud,
Upon the land in horror lay;
Fair peace had fled, and justice dead,
And dimm’d was freedom’s heavenly ray;
In ev’ry heart was dread dismay,
And war’s grim spectre lowered dun,
When on the gloom in glory’s bloom,
Flash’d forth the name of Washington!

CHORUS 1
’Tis a cherished name— ’Tis a word of might,
’Tis the pride of the brave and free,
’Tis a beaconlight on the starcrown’d height
Of deathless Liberty!
’Tis the watchword of truth and freedom won,
The glorious name of our Washington!

2. When the earth was red with carnage dread,
And darkly doubtful frown’d the skies,
When cannon’s flash and squadron’s crash
Blent with a nation’s anguished cries,
Who bade the star of hope arise?
Who lit the gloom like freedom’s sun?
What godlike form outbrav’d the storm?
It was our heartshrin’d Washington!

CHORUS 2
’Tis a word of love— ’Tis a name for right!
’Tis a watchword for eternity!
’Tis a beaconbright on the starcrown’d height
Of deathless Liberty!
Down the echoes of ages still shall run
The glorious name of our Washington!

3. When war’s surcease brought white robe’d peace,
With countless blessings on her wings,
When Nature smiled on home and wild,
Freed from the godless grasp of kings,
When time had soothed and mem’ry’s stings,
And love was crowned in freedom’s throne,
Who shared love’s peace with heav’nborn grace,
Our heartthroned hero Washington!

CHORUS 3
The first in war as in peace divine,
Ever sweet to us that name shall be,
As the flow’rs that twine round Vernon’s shrine,
Where rests the great and free,
Till fame’s trump is hushed and time is done
Shall endure the name of our Washington!
