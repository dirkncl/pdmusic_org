1. 
With half the Western world at stake,
See Perry on the midland lake,
  The unequal combat dare;
Unawed by vastly stronger pow’rs,
He met the foe and made him ours,
  And closed the savage war,
  And closed the savage war.

2. 
Macdonough, too, on Lake Champlain,
In ships outnumbered, guns, and men,
  Saw dangers thick increase;
His trust in God and virtue’s cause,
He conquer’d in the lion’s jaws,
  And led the way to peace,
  And led the way to peace.

3.
To sing each valliant hero's name
Whose deeds have swelled the lists of fame,
  Requires immortal powers;
Columbia's warriors never yield
To equal force by sea or field,
  Her eagle never cowers,
  Her eagle never cowers.

4.
Long as Niagra's cataract roars,
Or Erie laves our Northern shores,
  Great Brown, thy name shall rise;
Outnumbered by a veteran host
Of conquering heroes, Britain's boast--
  Conquest was there thy prize,
  Conquest was there thy prize.

5.
At Plattsburg, see the Spartan band,
Where gallant Macomb held command,
  The unequal host oppose;
Provost confounded, vanquished flies,
Convinced that numbers won't suffice
  Where Freemen are the foes,
  Where Freemen are the foes.

6.
Our songs to noblest stains will raise
While we attempt thy matchless praise,
  Carolina's godlike son;
While Mississippi rolls his flood,
Or Freedmen's hearts move patriot's blood,
  The palm shall be thine own,
  The palm shall be thine own.

7.
At Orleans-- lo! a savage band,
In countless numbers gain the strand,
  "Beauty and spoil" the word--
There Jackson with his fearless few,
The invincibles by thousands slew,
  And dire destruction poured,
  And dire destruction poured.

8.
O Britain! when the tale is told
Of Jackson's deeds by fame enrolled,
  Should grief and madness rise,
Remember God, the avenger, reigns,
Who witnessed Havre's smoking plains,
  And Hampton's female cries,
  And Hampton's female cries.
