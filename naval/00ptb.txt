1. Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling 
The darling of our crew. 
No more he’ll hear the tempest howling, 
For death has broach’d him to. 
His form was of the manliest beauty, 
His heart was kind and soft; 
Faithful below he did his duty, 
And now he’s gone aloft,
And now he’s gone aloft.

2. Tom never from his word departed,
His virtues were so rare,
His friends were many and truehearted.
His Poll was kind and fair;
And thus he’d sing so blithe and jolly,
Ah! many’s the time and oft,
But mirth is turn’d to melancholy
For Tom is gone aloft,
For Tom is gone aloft.

3. Yet shall Poor Tom find pleasant weather,
When He, who all commands
Shall give, to call life’s crew together,
The word to pipe all hands.
Thus death, who Kings and Tars dispatches
In vain Tom’s life has doff’d;
For tho’ his body’s under hatches,
His Soul is gone aloft,
His Soul is gone aloft.
