"Old Ironsides" (1830)
(The U. S. S. Constitution.)

[In 1830 the _Constitution_, frigate, was surveyed, condemned,
and ordered to be broken up.  The news spread like wild-fire
throughout the land, the popular indignation finding 
expression in the following lines by Dr. O. W. Holmes then 
but 21 years of age.  The poem was eagerly caught up and 
copied in almost every newspaper in the country.  In 
Washington it was printed on hand-bills and distributed 
through the city.  The result was the preservation of the 
ship, another example of the influence of song.  (See 
Introduction.)  She is now, 1912, lying at the Boston Navy 
Yard, restored as far as practicable to her original condition
by virture of and Act of Congress (The Naval Appropriation 
bill of June 29, 1906).]

1. Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! 
Long has it waved on high, 
And many an eye has danced to see 
That banner in the sky; 
Beneath it rung the battle shout 
And burst the cannon’s roar; 
The meteor of the ocean air 
Shall sweep the clouds no more! 
[REFRAIN]
Beneath it rung the battle shout 
And burst the cannon’s roar; 
The meteor of the ocean air 
Shall sweep the clouds no more!

2. Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!
[REFRAIN]
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!

3. O better that her shattered nulk
Should sink beneath the waves;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set ev’ry threadbare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,
The lightning and the gale!
[REFRAIN]
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set ev’ry threadbare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,
The lightning and the gale!
