1. Of all the flags that float aloft,
O’er Neptune’s gallant tars,
That wave on high in victory,
Above the sons of Mars,
Give us the flag— Coumbia’s flag,
The emblem of the free,
Whose flashing stars blazed thro’ our wars,
For Truth and Liberty.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Then wave it, lads, o’er ocean’s brine,
And give it three times three,
And fling it out, ’mid song and shout,
The Banner of the Sea.

2. Beneath its folds we fear no foe,
Our hearts shall never quail,
With bosoms bare the storms we’ll dare,
And brave the battle gale;
And tho’ the cannon plow our decks,
The planks with gore run red,
Stull thro’ the fray our flag alway
Shall gleam far overhead.

3. On ev’ry wave, to ev’ry shore,
Columbia’s flag shall go,
And thro’ all time its fame subline
With brighter hues shall glow;
For Freedom’s standard is our flag,
Its guardians, Freedom’s sons,
And woe betide th’insulter’s pride,
When we cast loose our guns.

4. Its enemies our own shall be,
Upon the land or main;
Its starry light shall gild the fight,
And guide our iron rain;
Nor foreign pow’r nor treason’s arts
Shall shake our patriot love,
While with our life, in peace or strife
We’ll keep the flag above.

[Repeated CHORUS for Last Stanza]
Then wave it, lads, o’er ocean’s brine,
And give it three times three,
And fling it out, ’mid song and shout,
The Banner of the Sea.
