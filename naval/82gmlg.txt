1. he ship goes sailing down the bay,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
We may not meet for many a day,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
My heart will evermore be true,
That now we sadly say adieu;
Oh, kisses sweet I leave with you,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!

CHORUS [sung after each VERSE]
The ship goes sailing down the bay,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
’Tis sad to tear my heart away!
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!

2. I’ll miss you on the stormy deep,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
What can I do but ever weep?
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
My heart is broken with regret!
But never dream that I’ll forget;
I lov’d you once, I’ll love you yet,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!

3. Then cheer up till we meet again,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
I’ll try to bear my weary pain,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
Tho’ far I roam across the sea,
My ev’ry thought of you shall be,
Oh, say you’ll sometimes think of me,
  Goodbye, my lover, goodbye!
