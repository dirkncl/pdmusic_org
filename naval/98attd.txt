1. Fill all your glasses full tonight,
The wind is off the shore,
And be it feast or be it fight,
We pledge the Commodore, the Commodore,
We pledge the Commodore.

2. Thro’ days of storm, through days of rain,
On broad Pacific seas,
At anchor off the Isles of Palm,
Or with the Japanese, the Japanese,
Or with the Japanese.

3. Ashore, afloat, on deck, below,
Or where our bulldogs roar,
To back a friend or breast a foe,
We pledge the Commodore, the Commodore,
We pledge the Commodore.

4. We know our honor’ll be unsustained
  Wheree’re his pennant flies,
Our rights respected and maintained,
  Whatever Power defies, Power defies,
Whatever Power defies.

5. And when he takes the homeward tack
Beneath an Admiral’s flag,
We’ll hail the day that brings him back,
And have another jag, another jag,
And have another jag.

6. We drank to him no empty toast,
Nor was our boasting vain,
For on the far Phillipine coast
He “singed the beard of Spain, the beard of Spain,”
He “singed the beard of Spain.”

7. And up from all our hills and vales,
From city, town, and shore,
A mighty shout the welkin halls—
“Well done, brave Commodore! brave Commodore!
Well done, brave Commodore!”

8. An Admiral’s flag you now will fly,
You’ve won it like a man
Where heroes love to do or die,
Right in the battle’s van, the battle’s van,
Right in the battle’s van.

9. And on our history’s matchless scroll,
Writ large along its lines,
With those who’ve played a deathless role,
The name of Dewey shines, of Dewry shines,
The name of Devey shines.
