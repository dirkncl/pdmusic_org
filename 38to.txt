1. Woodman spare that tree.
Touch not a single bough, 
In youth it shelter’d me 
And I’ll protect it now;
It was  my father’s hand 
That placed it near his cot.
There, woodman, let it stand.
Thy axe shall harm it not!

2. That old familiar tree,
Whose glory and renown,
Are spread o’er land and sea,
And wouldst thou hack it down?
Woodman, forbear thy stroke!
Cut not its earhbound ties;
Oh! spare that aged oak,
Now towering to the skies!

3. When but an idle boy
I sought its grateful shade;
In all their gushing joy,
Here, too, my sisters played;
My mother kiss’d me here;
My father press’d my hand—
Forgive this foolish tear—
But let that old oak stand!

4. My heartstrings round thee cling,
Close as thy bark, old friend!
Here shall thy wildbird sing,
And still thy branches bend;
Old tree! the storm still brave!
And, woodman, leave the spot;
While I’ve a hand to save,
Thy axe shall harm it not!
