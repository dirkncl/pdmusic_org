1. 
When earth was at its morning,
And years were as a day,
God fashioned all the flowers
To make the young world gay.
So fresh, so fair, so lovely,
As they to blossom came,
God stooped from His high heaven
And gave to each a name.

2. 
One tiny blueeyed flower
Stood shyly and apart,
And spread in adoration
Its little golden heart.
“O blessed God!” it murmured,
Its soul with love aflame,
And looking up to greet Him
It quite forgot its name.

3. 
In shame its head bent lower,
And dewy tears welled up,
And filled to overflowing
Its little azure cup.
Then God said: “Little flower,
Thyself thou hast forgot,
It is no sin, if only
Thou wilt forget me not!”
