1.
My son! I proudly see him marching by,
My only son, who goes maybe to die;
The smile he sends me as he hurries past
Will cheer my heart as long as life shall past.
My son, my son!

2.
My son! along the battlefield he goes;
The agony of love a mother knows
In following him through ev'ry hour of each day
To be a comfort on his weary way.
My son, my son!

3.
My son1 again I see him marching by,
In all the world there's only he and I.
Thank God, thank God, the victory's won!
The world has freedom, and I have my son!
