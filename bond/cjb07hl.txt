1.
You cried in your sleep for your mother dear,
Baby, Baby.
I would you could call her back to us here,
Baby, Baby.
The little lambs are asleep on the sod,
And my own lambkin's beginning to nod,
And over the starlight your mother's with God,
Baby, Baby.

2.
Sleep has come to the birds with the dew,
Baby, Baby.
Her eyes were as blue as the eyes of you,
Baby, Baby.
Dreams for your slumbers come up from the deep,
I'll love as she loved till morning lights peep,
And mother above us will watch while we sleep,
Baby, Baby.
