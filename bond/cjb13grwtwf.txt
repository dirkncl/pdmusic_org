1.
How many gardens in this world of ours,
Hold blossoms that have never come to flow'rs?
A sudden wind comes coldly by,
The rose tree bids its fairest bud goodbye.

2.
How many ships of ours go out to sea,
In search of havens that shall tranquil be?
The storms of fate their fairest hopes o'er set,
And there is naught to do except forget.

3.
How many weary a smile upon their face,
Although their hearts may hold an empty place?
None know the heights nor depths of their regrets,
But God remembers when the world forgets.
