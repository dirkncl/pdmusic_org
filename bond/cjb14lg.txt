"Life's Garden" (1914)
Words by Fred Jacobs Smith

Out of life's garden, where sympathy grew,
I found a heart,'twas the heart of you.
In that same garden devotion grew,
And I found a soul, 'twas the soul of you.
And still farther on, where the flow'rs are few,
I looked for hours, through the mist and dew,
Till I found my ideal, and mother, my mother,
My mother, 'twas you.
