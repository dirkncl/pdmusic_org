[Source: pp. 36-39 from "Songs Everybody Sings"]

1.
Sometimes when shadows cross my path,
As shadows sometimes do,
I reach my hands across the mist
And touch the hand of you.
I know the sun is in the sky,
I know true love is true;
But oh, it comforts in the dark
To touch the hand of you.

2.
Though all the silence of the years,
Through friendships old and new,
The dearest mem'ry of my life,
I touch the hand of you.
So clouds and sorrows come along,
We all must have a few;
But through them all, please God, let me
Still touch the hand of you.
