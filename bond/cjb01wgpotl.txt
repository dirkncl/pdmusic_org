1.
There is a stillness, but it is not death,
When life and light depart;
There is a calmness, but is is not death,
When God has stopped the heart.
There's a room we enter just to sleep,
Where God puts out the lights;
And in the morning when we wake
We've passed all earthly nights,
And in the morning when we wake
We've passed all earthly nights.

2.
The glorious lights of heaven shine with peace,
The gates of sorrow past;
And ev'ry earthly ill we know
Is lost and gone at last.
O you, who think that death is fear,
And keep that fear in sight;
Be sure your sleep will be serene
When God puts out the light,
Be sure your sleep will be serene
When God puts out the light.
