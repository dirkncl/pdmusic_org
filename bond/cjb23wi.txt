1.
Were I a leaf I'd like to be
A scarlet one upon a tree,
And I would swing and never fall,
Just cling and cling, and fool 'em all!

2.
Were I a rose I'd be so rare
They would not find me ev'rywhere,
And from the day that I was born
I would not grow a single thorn.

3.
Were I a star up in the sky
I'd wear a twinkle in my eye,
I'd shine so bright they could not see
Another single star but me!
