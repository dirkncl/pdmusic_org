1.
As I sit in the twilight of life and of day,
I want to go home, oh, I want to go home!
As I think of the friends I have lost by the way,
I want to go back to my mother.

2.
The meadow, the orchard, the swinging grapevine,
Makes me long to go home, how I long to go home!
The scenes of my childhood, the love that was mine
Takes me back to my home and my mother.

3.
My mother still sits by the ivy-crowned door,
And I want to go home, how I want to go home!
She is here in my heart, though I see her no more,
O Time! take me back to my mother!
