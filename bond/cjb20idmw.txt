1.
I've done my work, I've sung my song,
I've done some good, I've done some wrong,
And I shall go where I belong;
The Lord has willed it so.
He knows my heart and ev'ry thought,
He knows what paing and joy I've brought;
And by His love I shall be taught
The way to Hymn I know.

2.
He knows my soul so weak and blind,
So full of fears of mortal mind,
And He will lead, and I shall find
The way to Him, I know.
He guides my steps, and He knows best,
He will not harm where He is blest.
And so goodnight, I'll take my rest,
Where sweet wild roses grow.
