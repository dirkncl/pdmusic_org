1. Some little children hear a song
that mother sweetly isngs
When they are tired and bedtime comes,
What joy and peace it brings.

And some sweet children thake their dolls
to hold so snug and tight.
But my own dearie always said,
“Des hold my hands tonight.”

2. Oh, little hands so soft and white,
your memory I keep.
Could I but live that time again,
To lay you down to sleep.

This lonely life that I have led
would all seem gay and bright
If I could only hear you say,
“Des hold my hand tonight.”
