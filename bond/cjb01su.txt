1. Ah! ’tis but a dainty flow’r
I bring to you;
Yes, ’tis but a violet glist’ning with dew.
But deep in its heart there lie,
Beauties concealed,
So, too, in my heart of hearts,
Love unrevealed.

2. Ah! ’tis but a faded flow’r
Kept thro’ the years;
Yes, ’tis but a violet wet with my tears.
Yet deep in my heart of hearts,
Truest and best,
There lives my love for you
Still unexprest.
