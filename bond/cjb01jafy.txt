"Just A-Wearyin' For You" (1901)
Words by Frank Stanton
Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
Just a-wearyin' for you,
All the time a-feelin' blue,
Wishin' for you, wound'rin' when
You'll be comin' home again.
Restless, don't know what to do,
Just a-wearyin' for you.

2.
Mornin' comes, the birds awake,
Used to sing so for your sake
But there's sadness in the notes
That come trillin' from their throats.
Seem to feel your absence, too,
Just a-wearyin' for you.

3.
Eve-nin' comes, I miss you more
When the dark gloom's round the door,
Seems just like you orter be
There to open it for me,
Latch goes tinklin', thrills me through,
Set me wearyin' for you.
