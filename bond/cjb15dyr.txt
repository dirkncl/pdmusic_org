1.
Do you remember the days in the mountains?
Do you remember the mist on the lea?
Do you remember the scent of the wildflow'rs?
And are the mem'ries still mem'ries of me?
Do you remember the dew on the fern leaves
Down by the brook that flows on to the sea?
Do you remember the songs sung together?
And, thus rememb'ring, think sometimes of me?

[REFRAIN sung after each verse]
Remember, remember,
Althou' we're apart,
Thro' silence and distance
You still hold my heart.

2.
Do you remember the days in the mountains?
Do you remember the sky's wondrous blue?
Do you remember the meadowlark's singing?
To me those mem'ries are mem'ries of you.
Do you remember the song of the cricket?
And the soft moonbeams aslant on the hill?
Do you remember the soft winds a-sighing
Down thro' the [ca-?] so peaceful and still?
