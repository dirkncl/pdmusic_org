1.
You's my little black baby wid a turned up nose,
An' a little bunch o' wool upon yo' head;
You's got dimples in yo' elbows an' wrinkles in yo' toes,
An' a mouf lak a watermelyon red.

CHORUS 1
You's ma sweet, sweet pertater, you's ma ripe, ripe termater,
You's ma purty little black sugar ball;
You's a little bit o' honey dat de bees ain't foun',
You's my own pickaninny--dat's all!

2.
You's de onlies' little darlin' in de whole roun' worl',
An' yo' got little fingahs on my heart;
You's ma little bit o' wooly headed brown eyed gal
Dat I'se always longin' for when we're apart.

CHORUS 2
For I don't know what I'll do if it wasn't jes' fo' you,
You's ma purty little black sugar ball;
You's a little bit o' honey dat de bees ain't foun',
You's my own pickaninny--dat's all!
