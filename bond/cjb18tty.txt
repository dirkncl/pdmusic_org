To Mabel Geneva Sharp
"Through the Years" (1918)
Words & Music by
Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
The birds don't sing as sweetly as they did when I was young,
I see the sunbeams thro' a mist,
The fleeting hours beyond
And as I hear the echo of a voice I knew of old,
Again I hear the harpsichord, again this story's told.

[Refrain, sung after each verse]
Time makes all but love the past,
Love is ever new;
Should the darkness gather fast,
I would still see you.
I would hear your voice so sweet singing thro' the years,
I would see the face I loved thro' a mist of tears.

2.
I used to love the twilight, to hear the cricket sing,
But now the time 'twixt day and night
Can only sorrow bring.
How sad to part from those we love, how hard to say goodbye,
But listen to the harpsichord, old songs will never die.
