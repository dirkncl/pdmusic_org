1. Say not “goodbye” the sounds have all regret,
I cannot loose your hand with such a word,
Our ways part here and yet ah love and yet,
I cannot leave you till my soul has heard,
The charm to bring me to your side again.
The dear Auf Wiedersehn “Auf Weider sehn,”
The charm to bring me to your side again.
The dear “Auf Wiedersehn,”
The dear “Auf Wiedersehn.”

2. Say not “adieu” the word has hidden pain,
Within its foreign accents sweet and clear,
That haunts my heart with sad and hopeless strain,
And pleads with duty just to linger here.
Smile courage in mine eyes O love and then.
The dear Auf Wiedersehn, “Auf Wiedersehn.”
Smile courage in mine eyes O love and then,
Whisper “Auf Wiedersehn,”
Whisper “Auf Wiedersehn.”

3. Say not “farewell” if thou wouldst have it so—
The word, like a wan hand wave us apart.
I cannot leave, “mein liebling” will not go,
Until you whisper lying on my heart
The golden bridge between the now and then,
The sweet Auf Wiedersehn, “Auf Wiedersehn.”
The golden bridge between the now and then,
The sweet “Auf Wiedersehn,”
The sweet “Auf Wiedersehn.”
