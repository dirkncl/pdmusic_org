"The Golden Key" (1924)

1.
I found a Golden Key one day,
Upon the path I trod;
And it unlocked a Golden Door,
The door that led to God.
And as I look'd inside I saw
These words upon the wall:
"Your God is Love, and Love brings work,
There's Love and work for all."

2.
No idle life can happy be,
We all must do our part,
Must work awhile and play awhile
With all our soul and heart;
For those who do their work with joy,
Grim toil can live no more,
And in their hands they'll find the Key
That opens ev'ry door.
