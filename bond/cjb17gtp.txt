Here I am,  my mother dear,
I come quickly when I hear
Your sweet voice calling me,
Your sweet voice calling me.
You’re as kind as kind can be,
Mother, dearie, can I do
Any little thing for you,
Any little thing for you?

Got to practice? Oh dear me!
I’m so tired as I can be;
Mercy, mother, can’t you see
You should not do this to me!
Thirty minutes, did you say?
Thirty minutes ev’ry day?
What a dreadful thing to do,
When I am so kind to you!
