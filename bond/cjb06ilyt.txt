"I Love You Truly" (1906)
by Carrie Jacobs-Bond

1.
I love yuo truly, truly, dear;
Life with its sorrow, life with its tear,
Fades into dreams when I feel you are near,
For I love you truly, truly, dear.

2.
Ah, love, 'tis something to feel your kind hand,
Ah, yes, 'tis something by your side to stand;
Gone is the sorrow,
Gone doubt and fear,
For you love me truly, truly, dear.
