"In the Meadow" (1925)
Words and Music by
Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
Today I walked within a lovely meadow,
I heard the crickets chirping in the grass.
A gentle meadowlark was gaily singing,
And only ceased his song to let me pass.
Then mem'ry took me back again to childhood,
To happy days and songs that once were sung.
While you and I were walking in the meadow,
As lovers did when you and I were young.

2.
The years have passed, but we have walked together
Through gardens that were filled with thyme and rue.
But I have never known a lonely hour, dear,
Because along the path I walked with you.
And now that winter time has come upon us
Again I hear the songs that once were sung
While you and I were walking in the meadow,
As lovers did when you and I were young.
