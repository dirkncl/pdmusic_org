1.
O, England's full of Englishmen
And France is full of Frence,
And Italy has sons enough
To fill up ev'ry trench;
But what are we across the sea
Who come from all the earth
To the land that gave us freedom,
Though it did no give us birth?
O, we are all Americans,
And when we come away
From England, France and Italy,
We swore we came to stay.

2.
To Italy and Austria,
To Russia, Greece and Spain,
We said "Goodbye, we've gone for good,
We'll not be back again;
And we will lift our country's flaf
And float its Stripes and Stars
In place of those we used to wave
For Kaisers, Kings and Czars,
For we are all Americans,
And when we come away
From anywhere and ev'rywhere,
Dear land, we came to stay.

3.
Yet we will cross the seas again
To Europe's tortured sod,
With these who, though not brothers born,
Are brothers under God.
Since we have sworn our manhood's oath,
We stand to make it good
Againse the mightiest foes of earth,
Whatever be their blood,
For we are all Americans,
And we will fight our way
To victory and back again,
And then come home to stay.
