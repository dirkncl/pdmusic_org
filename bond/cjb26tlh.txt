I want to have a little house with sunlight on the floor,
A chimney with a rosy hearth and lilacs by the door,
With windows looking East and West,
And a crooked apple tree,
And room beside the golden fence, for hollyhocks to be,
And room beside the golden fence, for hollyhocks to be.

Oh, all my life I’ve wander’d ’round,
But the heart is quick at knowing,
Its own roof and its own bush,
And its own boughs ablowing,
And when I find that little house,
At noon or dusk, or dawn,
I’ll walk right in and light the fire,
And put the kettle on,
I’ll walk right in and light the fire,
And put the kettle on.
