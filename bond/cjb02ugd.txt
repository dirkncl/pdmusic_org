To Mr. Charles W. Clark
"Until God's Day" (1902)
Words by Frank L. Stanton
Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

A little while to walk with you my own, 
Only a little way­­ 
Then one of us must weep and walk alone until God's day. 
A little while it is so sweet to live together, 
That I know life would not have one tear to give, 
If one of us should go, 
If one of us should go. 
And if these lips should ever learn to smile 
With your heart far from mine, 
'Twould be for joy that in a little while 
They should be kissed by thine by thine; 
'Twould be for joy they should be kissed by thine.
