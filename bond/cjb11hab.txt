1.
Hush-a-baby, close yo' eyes,
An' go right off t' sleep,
Great big goblin comin' sure
T' ketch yo' ef yo' peep.
'Tain's no use t' make a fuss,
Yo' better snuggle tight
'Spect I'se gwain t' play wif yo'
All day an' half de night?

2.
Ebe'nin's growin' mighty late,
De birds hab gone to nest;
Ev'ryting wif eyes t' close
Hab shut em' tight in rest.
Mammy's eyes am tired, too,
De moon it am so bright,
Gwain t' go t' bed maself,
Good night, dear child, good night.

(Hum)
