of the Turn of the Century"]

[1] "Making the Best of It"
What you can't help,
what you can't help,
what you can't help,
forget!

[2] "First Ask Yourself"
Before you said it about them,
Ask yourself if you'd like them
to know you said it.

[3] "To Understand"
To understand a sorrow,
You must have one all all your own.

[4] "Doan' Yo' Lis'n"
No mattah w'at dey said,
Keep a walking' straight ahaid
W'y dey'll praise yo' when yo' daid,
But doan' yo' lis'n.

[5] "How to Find Success"
The man who finds success,
looks sometimes when he's tired,
when he's tired, when he's tired,
when he's tired, looks sometimes
when he's tired.

[6] "The Pleasure of Giving"
I'd rather say "You're welcome" once,
than "Thank you" a thousand times.

[7] "Answer the First Rap"
Opportunity may knock down,
but's it's better to answer the first rap!

[8] "A Good Excercise"
With evil things you'll always find
It's best to be deaf, dumb and blind.

[9] "A Present from Yourself"
A friend is a present you give yourself.

[10] "Now and Then"
The "lucky" fellow gets up at five (AM),
and gen'rally works till ten (PM);
But the other fellow, not quite so "lucky," works hard--
just now and then!

[11] "When They Say the Unkind Things"
Ain't it gay -- that what "they say" --
Can't hurt you -- unless it's true?

[12] "Keep Awake"
Success never comes to the sleeping.
