1.
Great mother of a newborn race,
All earth shall be thy dwelling place;
Democracy, thy holy name
Shall not the continents aflame,
Shall thrill the islands of the sea,
And keep thy children ever free.

2.
From God's eternal universe
Shall thou remove the primal curse
Which man upon his fellowman
Imposed since first the world began;
Away with slaves, deprived of rights
And lily-fingered parasites!

3.
For thus God's newworld purpose we
Can, step by step, unfolded see;
Columbus sailed, at His behest,
From lands by wicked kings oppressed--
God's instrument, to search the earth
And find the place for Freedom's birth.

4.
And Washington, America's undaunted son,
Whose spirit, caught beyond the blue,
Encompassed France and Europe too,
Until the purpose of the Lord
Was plainly written with the sword.

5.
Today the climax of the fight;
A world embattled for the right,
We brave the tyrant's frenzied hour
Till shattered thus shall be his pow'r
And all the world made safe for thee--
Hail, glorious Democracy!
