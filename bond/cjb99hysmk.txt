1.
Have you seen my kitten gray,
She's the cat that runs away,
My but she is awful wild,
She'a a dreadful, dreadful child,
Just as soon as she sees me,
Off she goes and climbs a tree,
Yet that kitten I love well,
What's the matter can you tell?

REFRAIN [such after each verse]
Dear me puxz!
Kittie, Kittie, Kittie,
Kittie come and play,
Kittie, Kittie, Kittie, Kittie,
Please don't run away.
You're the kitten I love well.
What's the matter can't you tell?
Kittie, Kittie come let's play.

2.
Did she climb a tree so high,
Seemed to reach most to the sky,
Did she always squirm and wail,
If you held her by the tail.
Mama says that it's all me,
Kittens really good will be,
But the kittens I have known,
Seem to want to live alone.
