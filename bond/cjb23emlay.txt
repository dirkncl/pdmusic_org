Tho’ the cares of the day be many, 
And the fruits of the struggle few, 
I know at the close comes ev’ning, 
Ev’ning, my dear, and you. 

Then you come and sit beside me, 
The hope of the parting day, 
And say, in the words I’ve dreamed of, 
The things I would have you say. 

Then the world is lost in the gloaming, 
And life sweetens down to this: 
The warmth of your hand in the twilight, 
Ev’ning, my love and your kiss.
