To the memory of little Bernice.
"A Little Pink Rose" (1912)
by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

A little pink rose in my garden grew,
The tinniest one of all,
'Twas kissed by the sun, caressed by the dew,
Oh, little pink rose in my garden,
Oh little pink rose, 'twas you!

Oh, little pink rose of your mother's heart!
Have you faded and gone away?
Has the Gardener gathered my little pink rose,
For His loveliest garden today?
Did He seed one more blossom of your vine and hue,
And was that the reason the Gard'ner chose you?

Oh, little pink rose in your mother's heart,
Have you faded, and gone away?
