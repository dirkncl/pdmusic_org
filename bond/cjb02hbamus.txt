Words by Mary Norton Bradford (Revised Edition, 1918)
Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

Chicago: The Bond Shop, 746 So. Michigan Ave.

1.
My daddy's all dressed up today,
He never looked so fine,
I thought, when I looked at him,
My daddy wasn't mine.
He's got a dandy, fine new suit,
The old one was so old,
It's brown, he wears an eagle, too,
I guess it must be gold.

CHORUS
{But my | So my} daddy just belongs to my dear mother,
And I guess the folks are blind who cannot see
That his buttons are marked "U. S.,"
And that spells "us," I guess,
So he just belongs to mother dear and me.

2.
My daddy's sort o' glad and sort
O' sad I wonder why?
And ev'ry time she looks at him,
It makes my mother cry.
Who's Uncle Sam? my daddy says
That he belongs to him,
But daddy's joking 'cause I know
My uncle's name is Jim.

(CHORUS)
