"Just Lonesome" (1905)
Words by Harriet Axtell Johnstone
Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
It isn't the weather, (Dear, soft little rain!)
God's sunshine and show'rs never fret me,
And it isn't the learning in poverty's school,
The hard delving lesson that's set me:
For sun follows rain
And saving makes gain,
But Time can't give back a dead lover,
And in spite of the sun and the gold to be won,
There's a sob that no laughter can cover.

2.
There's not even a rhyme for this one dreary line,
And there's no other word holds the mean-ing;
It carries a heartache
Wherever it's heard,
And brings even desolate dreaming,
Just lonesome.
