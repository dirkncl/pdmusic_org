Words and Music by

1.
All thro' the mist of the dawning,
All thro' the mountain space,
All thro' the valley's glimmer,
I see your loving face.

2.
All thro' the sunrise beauty,
All thro' the mists that rise,
All thro' the shadows falling,
I look into your eyes.

All thro' the sunset's glory,
Out in the lovely west,
I hear your low voice singing,
Your hands press my own, and I rest.
