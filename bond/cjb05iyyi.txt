1.
Is yo' de li'l coon dat comes a-knockin' at my do',
An' when I gives yo' what yo' want, yo' always wants some mo'?
Is yo? Is yo?
Is yo' de li'l coon dat always wants a snack,
An' 'fo' yo' get yo'r cone pone done yo' comes a-beggin' back?
Is yo'? Is yo'?

2.
Is yo' de li'l coon dat's always tumblin' down,
An' yell so loud yo' mammy tink yo' done gone broke yo' crown?
Is yo'? Is yo'?
Is yo' de li'l coon wid such a sleepy haid
Dat clim' up in yo'r mammy's arms an' want to go to baid?
Is yo'? Is yo'?

3.
Is yo' de li'l coon dat yo' mammy rock to res',
De one dat in de whole wide worl' yo' mammy lub de bes',
Is yo'? Is yo'?
Is yo'?
Is yo'?
Yo' is!
