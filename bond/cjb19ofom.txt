1. Oh take my hand and clasp it tight, 
And promise me that thro’ life’s fight 
We’ll steadfast stand in loyal might, 
Dear friend of mine, old friend of mine! 
Look on me well before we part 
And read the friendship in my heart, 
And feel my quickened pulses start, 
Dear friend of mine, old friend of mine!

2. Perhaps we’ll meet some moonlit night 
On some far desert plain or height 
Our comradeship to reunite, 
Dear friend of mine, old friend of mine!  
But if our hopes be only vain 
And on Death’s scroll be writ my name, 
Live on! my soul will still remain 
Dear friend of mine, old friend of mine!
