1. I’ve a cottage in God’s garden.
Upon a mountain high,
Away from strife and turmoil
And all life’s din and cry.
Away from care and sorrow,
From all life’s tears and woe,
A cottage in God’s garden
Where I am free to go.

2. I’ve a cottage in God’s garden
Where my tired feet may rest,
And, weary though my soul be,
My spirit there is blessed.
The wild birds chant their carols,
And wild flow’rs bloom galore
Out in God’s lovely garden—
How could I ask for more?
