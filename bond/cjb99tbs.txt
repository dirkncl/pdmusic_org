To Grace Duffie Boylan
"The Bird Song" (1899)
by Carrie Jacobs Bond
from "Four Songs"

1.
My baby is so tired tonight,
She does not like the candle light.
The little head will soon be pressed
Against her mama's loving breast,
And mama's song will sound the best.

CHORUS
So bylo, bylo, little baby sleep.
So bylo, bylo, God his watch will keep.
Oh baby mine, how fondly I love you.
Oh baby mine, a mother's love is true.

2.
The little birds have gone to rest.
The mama bird sits by the nest.
The little stars begin to shine,
To light the sky for sleepy time,
And make it bright sweet child of mine.

(CHORUS)

3.
If I could shield you from all care,
And keep your face forever fair,
As now I see it while you sleep,
These eyes of mine no more would weep,
This heart of mine its peace would keep.

(CHORUS)
