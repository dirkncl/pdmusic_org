1. Lay me down benea’ de willows in de grass, 
Whah de breeze’ll be a singin’ as it pass, 
An’ when I’se lyin’ low, 
I kin hear it as it go 
Singin’, “sleep mah honey, take y’r res’s at las’.”

2. Lay me nigh to whah it makes a little peel,.
An’ de watah stan’s so quiet like an’ cool,
Whah de little birds in spring
Ust to come an’ drink an’ sing,
An’ de chilluns waded on der way ter school.

3. Let me settle when my shoulders drop de load,
Nigh enough to hear de noises in de road,
Foh I tink dat las’ long res’
Gwine to suit my spirit bes’
If I’se lyin’ long de tings I always know’d.
