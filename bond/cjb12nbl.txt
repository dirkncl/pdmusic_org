Well, I vow!
I aint got nothin', and I never had nothin',
And I don't want nothin' 'cept you;
I aint seen nobody,
I aint know' nobody,
I aint loved nobody, that's true,
But if you'll love me,
I'll love you.
If you want money, though, I wont do;
'Cause I aint got nothin', and I never had nothin',
And I don't want nothin' 'cept you.
