[Just A-Wearyin' for You]
Just a-wearyin' for you,
All the times a feelin' blue,
Wishin' for you, wandrin' when
You'll be comin' home again;
Restless, don't know what to do,
Just a-wearyin' for you.

[A Perfect Day]
When you come to the end of a Perfect Day,
And you sit alone with your thought,
While the chimes ring our with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brouht,
Do you think what the end of a Perfect Day
Can mean to a tired heart,
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?
