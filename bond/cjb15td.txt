1. Today, dear heart, but just today,
The sunshine over all,
The roses crimsoning the air,
Along the garden wall.
Then let the dream and dreamer die;
Whate’er shall be, shall be;
Today will still be thine and mine,
To all Eternity.

2. And, oh! the little, little while
This world shall last for us,
There is no way to keep it, dear,
But just to speed it, thus.
There is no hand may stop the sand
From flowing fast away,
But his, who turns the whole glass down,
And dreams, ’tis all today.

3. But, oh! there is no glory, dear,
When all the world is done;
There is no splendor lastesth out
The setting of the sun;
There is no thing that lasts, not one,
When we have turned to clay,
But this: You loved me— all the rest
Fades with the world away.
