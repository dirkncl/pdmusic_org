To F. E. H.
"Shadows" (1901)
Words and Music by
Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
Once more I sit at evening
And watch the embers burn,
The shadows all come creeping
Around me as I turn.
And then I see a sweet face,
From which all care is gone,
That starts my soul to dreaming
Of old times, love and song.

2.
How oft we watched the embers
And said, "how bright they glow!"
And then how fast the hour went,
But now, alas! how slow.
The days are all too long, dear,
The nights are longer still;
But I would not recall you
My longing heart to fill.

3.
I know you're 'way off yonder,
But still you seem with me,
And in the evening shadows,
Your form I almost see.
I almost hear you whisper
These words, "I love but you,
And soon we'll be unitied,
Sweetheart, be brave, be true."
