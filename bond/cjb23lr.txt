"Lazy River" (1923)
Words and Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946
[Source: pp. 63-66 from "Songs Everybody Sings]

1.
Days on the lazy river,
Far from life's care and fret.
Days on the lazy river
Are days I can never forget.
Days with their peace and music,
Singing my soul to rest.
Days on the lazy river
Are the days that I loved the best.

2.
A glance on the lazy river,
A smile and a little song--
Strange how the mem'ry of trifles
Can last so long, so long!
