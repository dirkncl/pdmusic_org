Little lost youth of me, where are you roaming, 
You who were part of me only today? 
Why did you slip from me out in the gloaming, 
Little lost youth of me, vanished away? 
Brightly the sun in the morning was streaming, 
Laughter bent over me, friendship was nigh; 
Love sat beside me, whose raiment was gleaming, 
And you, little youth of me, nestled close by. 

Sorrow looked in at my casement, and slowly 
Laughter and sunshine grew silent and gray. 
Friendship drew closer, and love became holy, 
But you, little youth of me, wandered away, 
wandered away, wandered away. 

Sorrow has passed and the sun is returning, 
Laughter and friendship and love are as dear. 
Now when I ask you with infinite yearning, 
Little lost youth of me, you are not here. 
Little lost youth of me, why did you leave me? 
You of my life were so lovely apart! 
Long will the wraith of you haunt me and grieve me, 
Little lost youth of me, slipped from my heart.
