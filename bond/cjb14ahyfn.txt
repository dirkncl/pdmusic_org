1.
A hundred years from now, dear, 
We shall not care at all, 
It will not matter then, a whit, 
The wa ry or the gall 
The comfort days, that we have known, 
Will all forgotten be, and flown, 
Where we the roses fall, 
Where we the roses fall. 
A hundred years from now, dear, 
We shall not mind the pain; 
The ? ?, with ? take of life 
Will not have left a stain. 
The song we sang Together, dear, 
Will ? ? ?. that ? a ? 
Amid a ?? ? 

2.
A hundred years from now, dear, 
We’ll neather know our care, 
What ’came of all life’ bitterness, 
Or followed love’s despair? 
Then fill the glasses up again, 
And kiss me thro’ the roseleaf rain, 
We’ll build our castle mote, in Spain, 
And dream, one more dream, there.
