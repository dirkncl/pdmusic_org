"Two Lovers" (1902)
Words Anonymous
Music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond, 1862-1946

1.
Oh! she was a gay little cigarette,
And he was a big cigar,
And side by side on a tabourette
they stood in a ginger jar,
Tho' never a word could I understand,
For they chatted in "autobac,"
Yet wonderful things I'm sure they planed,
As lovers do alack as lovers do alack.

2.
To day she's a sad little cigarette,
For gone is her brave cigar,
And all alone on the tabourette,
She stands in the ginger jar,
As love is a marvelous thing 'tis true,
And many a fault 'twill cloak,
But often it ends as the dream of these two,
In nothing at all but smoke.
