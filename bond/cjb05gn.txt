Good night.
Without a care or sorrow
Save impatience for the morrow,
Baby sleeps in fairy deeps,
Good night.
Good night.
The raptured lover lingers,
Touching lips and pressing fingers,
All to soon declines the moon,
Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.
The embers turn to ashes,
Eyes are closed with weighted lashes;
Hushed is life beyond all strife,
Good night, good night.
