1.
Will you come to the Bow'r I've shaded for you
Your bed shall be flow'rs all spangled with dew
Will you come to the Bow'r I've shaded for you
Your bed shall be flow'rs all spangled with dew

[REFRAIN]
  Will you will you will you will you come to the Bow'r.
  Will you will you will you will you come to the Bow'r.

2.
There under the Bow'r on roses you lie
With a blush in your cheek and a smile in your eye.
There under the Bow'r on roses you lie
With a blush in your cheek and a smile in your eye.

(REFRAIN)

3.
But the roses to [?] shall not rival your lip
Nor the dew be so sweet at the kisses we sip.

(REFRAIN)

4.
And Oh for the Joys that are sweeter than dew
From languishing roses and kisses from you.

(REFRAIN)
