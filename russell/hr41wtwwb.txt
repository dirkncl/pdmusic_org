1.
When the wild winds blow, and the stars are dark,
We sing o’er the wreck of the founder’d bark;
When the sailors whose trust was her lordly deck,
In agony cling to the faithless wreck,
In agony cling to the faithless wreck.
We bear to their hearts, on our crests of foam,
The voices belov’d in their lonely home:
We bear to their hearts, on our crests of foam,
The voices belov’d in their lonely home:
The voices belov’d in their lonely home.

2.
They sink, and the dirge for the dead we sing,
And their graves are made where the seaflow’rs spring,
And they rest as soft in their slumber deep
As they who on earth’s brown bosom sleep,
As they who on earth’s brown bosom sleep,
And the mermaids mourn o’er the sailor’s grave,
As mortals might weep fallen brave,
And the mermaids mourn o’er the sailor’s grave,
As mortals might weep for the fallen brave,
As mortals might weep for the fallen brave.

3.
Our voices are heard in the silence of night,
When the moon looks forth, and the stars are bright;
Pouring our melody far o’er the earth,
With a softened sweetness of mournful mirth;
With a softened sweetness of mournful mirth;
Answering the tones of a thousand rills,
That leap from the rocks o’re their pine clad hills.
Answering the tones of a thousand rills,
That leap from the rocks o’re their pine clad hills,
That leap from the rocks o’re their pine clad hills.
