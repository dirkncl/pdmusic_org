1.
Major McPherson was a very nice man,
la la la la la la la
He had but one eye and his name was Dan,
la la la la la la la
Major McPherson stood three foot four
la la la la la la la
The ladies all said what a pity he's not more
la la la la la la la
Yet so it is they were perfectly right
he was a Major by name yet a minor by right
Major McPherson heaved a sigh
la la la la la la la
Major McPherson didn't know why
la la la la la la la
But Major McPherson soon found out
twas all for miss Lavinia Scout
says Major McPherson I have no doubt
that I'm scorn'd by miss Lavinia Scout.

2.
Then as on her I still much doat
la la la la la la la
I'll make it a point to cut my throat
la la la la la la la
The Major McPherson took a razor
la la la la la la la
And said he "Oh how I'll amaze her"
la la la la la la la
"My fate decreed my hour is come"
la la la la la la la
He drew the edge across his thumb
la la la la la la la
But still on his woes did the Major harp
la la la la la la la
But the Major was young and the razor sharp
la la la la la la la
"I'll vanish" he said from her presence quick
la la la la la la la
So instead of his throat he cut his stick
la la la la la la la
