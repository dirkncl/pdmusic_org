1.
Long parted have we been,
Many troubles have we seen;
Since the weary day we left them, on the good old English shore,
And we took a last farewell to return to them no more,
But they're coming, coming, coming,
They are coming with the flowers,
They are coming with the summer,
To this new land of ours,
And we'll all forget our sadness,
And shake their hands in gladness;
And bid them joyous welcome,
To this new land of ours.

2.
How often have we pray'd
They were here in joy array'd,
The friends, the dear relations, and the lovers fond and true;
To share one better fortune,
And all the joys we knew,
And they're coming, coming, coming,
They are coming with the flowers,
They are coming with the summer,
To this new land of ours,
And we'll give them cordial greeting,
And have a merry meeting,
And a day of true rejoicing,
In this new land of ours.

3.
In all our happiness
There seem'd a joy the less,
When we look'd around and miss'd them from the fireside's cheerful glow;
The old familiar comrades that we loves so long ago,
But they're coming, coming, coming,
They are coming with the flowers,
They are coming with the summer,
To this new land of ours,
It needs but their embraces,
And all their smiling faces,
To make as quite contented,
In this new land of ours.
