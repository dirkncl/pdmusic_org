"The Slave Ship" (185?)
Words and Music by
Henry Russell, 1812-1900

[Allegro Moderato.]
1.
The first gray dawn of the morning was beaming,
The bright rays shone forth, the glad spirit of light;
The rising sun over the ocean was streaming,
And dispelled with his rays the dark shadows of night.
The air, oh how pure, and the morning, how mild,
And the waters lay hush'd like a sleeping child.

2.
Then up with the anchor, and let us away;
Spread the sails, 'tis a favoring wind;
And long o'er the break of the morning,
the break of the morning we'll leave
the coast of old Afric behind.
Softly, softly, let us away!
Sofly softly let us away!

3.
Gloomily stood the captain, with his arms upon his breast,
And his cold brow firmly knitted,
And his iron lips compress'd.
'Are all well whipp'd below there!'
'Ay, ay,' the seaman said.
'Heave up the worthless lubbers, the dying and the dead!'

[Allegro assai.]
Help! oh help! thou God of Christians,
Save a mother from despair!
Cruel white man stole my children
God have mercy, hear my prayer!
I'm young and strong and hardy;
He's a weak and sickly boy:
Take me, whip me, chain me, starve me!
God of mercy, save my boy!

[Recitative]
'They've killed my child! they've killed my child!'
The mother cried--now all is o'er:
Down the savage captain struck her,
Lifeless on the vessel's floor.

[Moderato con Anima.]
Old England, sweet land of the brave and the free,
Whose home is the waters, whose flag sweeps the see;--
Still stretch out thy hand o'er the ocean's broad wave,
Protecting the helpless unfortunate slave;
And nations which call themselves free shall repent
Of the thousands of souls to eternity sent.
Each who forwards the cause, on the verge of the grave
Shall be blessed by the prayer
[Lento]
of the poor negro slave.
