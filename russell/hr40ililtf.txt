1.
The wild streams leap with headlong sweep,
  In their curbless course o'er the mountain steep,
All fresh and strong they foam along,
  Waking the rocks with their cat'ract song,
My eye bears, a glance like the beam on a lance,
  While I watch the waters dash and dance,
I burn with glee --- For I love to see ---
  The path of any thing that's free,

CHORUS
I love, I love, oh I love the free,
I love, I love the free,
I love, I love, O I love the free,
I love, I love, I love the free.

2.
The Skylark springs with dew on its wings,
  And up in the arch heav'n he sings,
Trilla, trilla, oh sweeter far,
  Than the notes that come thro' a golden bar,
The joyous bay of a bound at play,
  The caw of a rook on its homeward way,
Oh these shall be --- the music for me ---
  For I love I love the path of the free,

(CHORUS)

3.
The mariner brave in his back on the wave,
  May laugh at the walls round a kingly slave,
And the one whose lot is the desert spot,
  Has no dread of an envious foe in his cot.
The thrall and state at the palace gate,
  And what my spirit has learnt to hate;
I burn with glee, for I love to see,
  The path of any thing that's free.

(CHORUS)
