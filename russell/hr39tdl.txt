1.
Saw ye the shadow o’er his brow,
The pallor o’er his cheek?
Say ye the sadness in his eye,
And did ye hear him speak?
Ah! ’twas an impulse horrible
Inflam’d, inflam’d his aged breast,
The blasting of his dying hopes
His poor wife’s sole bequest.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Saw ye the shadow o’er his brow,
The pallor o’er his cheek?
Saw ye the sadness in his eye,
And did ye hear him speak?

2.
But late, a daughter, simple child,
Sat pratling on his knee,
The solace of his tot’ring days,
His poor wife’s legacy!
And as he look’d into her eyes,
And watch’d, and watch’d her childish glee,
He mur-mur’d, dear, oh dear thou art
My poor wife’s legacy!

3.
’Tis now that old man weak and wan,
Sits comfortless and lone,
His child, alas! poor fall’n thing
Sickning to think upon.
And as her image meets his thoughts,
They strive, they strive to flee, to flee,
In vain, poor fall’n Emm’, he sobs.
My poor wife’s legacy!
