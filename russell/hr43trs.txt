1.
On a rocky cliff I stood,
And the Ocean wash'd its base,
A prospect "broad and good,"
The grateful eye could trace,
Not a cloud obscured the sky,
The dawn was bright and fair;
Nature, slub'ring, seem'd to lie
Inruffled by the air.

2.
In the east, the "rising sun"
Display'd his golden crest;
His daily race he had begun
Towards the glowing west;
O'er the waters of the deep,
His glitt'ring rays be shed,
While the sparkling billows leap
From out their liquid bed!

3.
See where bright Aurora twines
Her tresses round her brow,
As the rugged lofty pines
With admiration bow;
Dewy mists in sportive play,
Their glitt'ring veils unfold;
Like happy spirits, flee away
In tints of molten gold.

4.
Gentle zephyrs float around,
And murm'ring surges meet;
Blending their notes of sound
In music, wild and sweet.
How the grateful bosom burns
With wonder and with love,
As the soul in rapture turns
To brighter scenes above.
