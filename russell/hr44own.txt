1. Oh! weep not, oh! weep not, nor idly sigh,
Thy tears can recall not the days gone by:
The “quivering breath and the throbbing brow”
Should be lost in the light of hope’s pure glow.
Let memory paint in its brightest rays
The joys of thy heart in its happiest days;
But neglect not the precepts forget not the prayer
Which thy mother taught thee from “her old arm chair.”

2. Say, dost thou not deem her a Spirit blest,
Whose home is in realms of eternal rest,
And did she not teach thee that Hope was giv’n
A foretaste on Earth of the joys of Heaven?
Of all her precepts remember one
And practice it now “Thy will be done”:
In fancy then may’st thou see her there
And hear her voice from that old arm chair.

3. O think of her words of her looks resign’d
Of her cheerful heart, her contented mind
Of the hopeful lessons she taught thy youth,
As she turn’d with thee o’re the page of Truth.
Then weep not, oh! weep not nor idly sigh
Thy tears can recall not the days gone by:
Let thy morning hymn— and thy ev’ning prayer
Be breath’d in hope by that old arm chair.
