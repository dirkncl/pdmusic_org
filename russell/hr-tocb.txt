1.
Up with the rooks where none can reach,
A goodly priest am I,
And the world may hear my loud voice preach,
As the busy winds go by.

Over the bride with her orange flow'rs,
Over the dead man's form;
Now to make merry the bridal hours,
Then to arouse the worm.

CHORUS
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, Ding, dong;
Ding, dong, Ding, dong,
Ding dong Bell,
Ding dong dong.

2.
Up with the rooks where none can reach,
A goodly priest am I,
And the world may hear my loud voice preach,
As the busy winds go by.

The banner has wander'd o'er my belfry home,
While I peal'd with a nation's pride,
But ere the day had pass'd away,
I proclaim'd that a king had died.

CHORUS
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Ding dong dong,
Ding dong dong.

3.
Up with the rooks where none can reach,
A goodly priest am I,
And the world may hear my loud voice preach,
As the busy winds go by.

Ah! many shall wake and many shall sleep
'Neath the varied tales I tell,
And many a heart shall dance and weep,
To the tune of the Old Church Bell.

CHORUS
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, I ring or I toll,
For the young child's life, or the old man's soul.
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Ding dong dong,
Ding dong dong.
