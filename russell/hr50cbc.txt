1.
Cheer, boys, cheer, yield not to idle sorrow;
  Courage! true hearts shall bear us on our way;
Hope points before, and shows the bright to-morrow;
  Let us forget the darkness of to-day;
So farewell! England; much as we adore thee,
  We'll dry the tears that we have shed before;
Why should we weep to sail in search of fortune?
  So farewell, England! farewell forevermore!
Cheer, boys, cheer, for country, mother country,
  Cheer, boys, cheer, the willing strong right hand,
Cheer, boys, cheer, there's wealth for honest labor,
  Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land!

2.
Cheer, boys, cheer, the steady breeze is blowing,
  To float us freely o'er the ocean's breast;
The world shall follow in the track we're going;
  The star of Empire glitters in the West,
Here we had toil and little to reward it,
  But there shall plenty smile upon our pain;
And ours shall be the prairie and the forest
  And boundless meadows ripe, rip with golden grain.
Cheer, boys, cheer, for England, mother England;
  Cheer, boys, cheer, united heart and hand,
Cheer, boys, cheer, there's wealth for honest labor;
  Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land!
