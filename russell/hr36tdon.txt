1.
Hope on her wings and God her guide,
The Dove of Noah soar’d
Far thro’ the dim unfathom’d space
Where shoreless ocean roar’d,
Where shoreless ocean roar’d.
But ah! she found no valley green,
No resting place, no track,
Until the peaceful ark received
The wea-ry wand’rer back.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
Hope on her wings and God her guide,
The Dove of Noah soar’d
Far thro’ the dim unfathom’d space
Where shoreless ocean roar’d.

2.
So we, on life’s tempestuous sea,
Beset with grief and pain,
May seek a solace here below,
But ah! the search in vain!
But ah! the search in vain!
A resting place for weary man
Is only found a-bove,­­
The ark to which the soul returns
Is the Almighty’s love!
