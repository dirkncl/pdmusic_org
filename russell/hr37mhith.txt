1.
My heart's in the highlands my heart is not here
My heart's in hte highlands chasing the deer
A-chasing the wild deer and following the roe
Oh! my heart's in the highlands wherever I go
My heart's in the highlands wherever I go
Oh! farewell to the highlands, farewell to the north
The birth place of valor the country of worth;
Wherever I wander wherever I rove
The hills of the highlands forever I love
Oh! my heart's in the highland my heart is not here
My heart's in the highlands a-chasing the deer
A-chasing the deer and following the roe
Oh! my heart's in the highlands wherever I go
My heart's in the highlands wherever I go.

2.
Farewell to the mountains high cover'd with snow'
Farewell to the straiths and green valley's below;
Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;
Oh! farewell to the torrents and lound-pouring floods
Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods,
Oh! farewell to the highlands, farwell to the mirth
The birth place of valor the country of worth;
Wherever I wander wherever I rove
The hills of the highlands forever I love
Oh! my heart's in the highlands my heart is not here,
My heart's in the highlands a-chasing the deer;
A-chasing the deer, and following the roe,
Oh! my heart's in the highlands wherever I go,
My heart's in the highlands wherever I go.
