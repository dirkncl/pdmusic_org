[pages 49-51 from "100 Songs by Henry Russell]

1. 
We met in otheryears, love, 
When beau ty grac’d thy brow, 
Ere worldly cares and fears, love, 
Had sadden’d us as now­­ 
O! mem’ry’s pleasant places, 
Seem fairy land to me, 
When thought their path retraces, 
Belov’d one, with thee­­ 
Oh! my belov’d one, my belov’d one, with thee, 
Oh! my belov’d one, belov’d one, with thee.

2. 
What, hough thy cheek hath faded,
Far dearer now thou art,
Than when with blushes shaded,
Its brightness bless’d my heart.
Time, that with silver twines, love,
Our locks once flowing free,
Doth but more closely bind, love,
This doting heart to thee­­
Oh! my belov’d one, my belov’d one, with thee,
Oh! my belov’d one, belov’d one, with thee.
