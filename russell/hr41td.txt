1.
The wing of my spirit is broken
The day-star of hope has declined;
For a month not a word have I spoken,
That’s either polite or refin’d.
My mind’s like the sky in bad weather,
When mist clouds around us are curled;
And viewing myself altogether,
I’m the veriest wretch in the world!
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers,
But why tell me why did she kick me downstairs.

2.
I wander about like a vagrant
I spend half my time in the street
My conduct’s improper and flagrant
For I quarrel will all that I meet
My dress too is wholly neglected
My hat I pull over my brow,
And I look like a fellow suspected
Of wishing to kick up a row,
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers
But why, tell me why did she kick me downstairs.

3.
At home I’m an object of horror,
To boarder and waiter, and maid;
But my land-lady views me with sorrow,
When she thinks of the bill that’s unpaid.
Abroad my acquaintances flout me,
The ladies cry, “Bless us look there.”
And the little boys cluster around me,
And sensible citizens stare.
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers,
But why, tell me why, did she kick me downstairs.

4.
One says “He’s a victim to cupid.”
Another “His conduct’s too bad,”
A third, “He is awfully stupid,”
A fourth, “He is perfectly mad.”
And then I am watched like a bandit,
My friends with me all are at strife­­
By heaven, no longer I’ll stand it.
But quick put an end to my life!
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers,
But why, tel me why did she kick me downstairs.

5. I’ve thought of the means­­ yet I shud-der
At dagger, or ratsbane, or rope;
At drawing with lancet my blood, or
A razor without any soap.
Suppose I should fall in a duel
And thus leave the stage with e’clat;
But to die with a bullet is cruel,
Besides ’twould be breaking the law.
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers,
But why, tel me why did she kick me downstairs.

6.
Yet one way remains­­ to the river
I’ll fly from the goadings of care­­
But drown oh the thought makes me shiver
A terrible death, I declare.
An no! I’ll once more see my Kitty,
And parry her cruel disdain,
Beseech her to take me in pity,
And never dismiss me again­­
I suppose she was right in rejecting my prayers,
But why, tell me why did she kick me downstairs.
