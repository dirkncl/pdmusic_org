1. 
From his mountain land, with his harp in hand
Came a minstrel youth right merrily;
And he sang the lays of his boyhood days,
When the light of hope shone cheerily,
When the light of hope shone cheerily.
He sang the tales of his native vales
And of his Fathers bravery;
Then with pride he told, how his kinsmen bold
Fell nobly ere yield to slavery! Oh!

From his mountain land, with his harp in hand,
Came a minstrel youth right merrily;
And he sang the lays of his boyhood days,
When the light of hope shone cheerily,
When the light of hope shone cheerily.

’Mid a gallent throng, did that son of song
Tune his harp­­ but not so merrily
For his thoughts would roam­­ to distant home,
To the green hills smiling cheerily­­
To the green hills smiling cheerily,
With trembling hand of his Fatherland,
He sang with such deep emotion
And a tear drop came as he breath’d the name
Of the maid of his soul’s devotion Oh!

’Mid a gallant throng, did that son of song
Tune his harp­­ but not so merrily
For his thoughts would roam­­ to his distant home,
To the green hills smiling cheerily­­
To the green hills smiling cheerily,
