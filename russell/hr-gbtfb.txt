1.
I'm the man of the Fire Bri-gade
Whose val-our my name has made.
And where e-ver I go,
Fresh sym-pa-thies flow
To wel-come the Fire Bri-gade.
By the hel-met on my brow,
And the ma-ny a life I've saved
I am known at once
And a wel-come rings out
For the man of the Fire Bri-gade
Then huz-za, huz-za, huz-za
Three cheers for cour-age es-say'd
And the no-ble name each mem-ber has won
God bless the Fire Bri-gade.

CHORUS
Then huz-zah, huz-zah, huz-zah
There cheers for cour-age es-say'd
And the no-ble name each mem-ber has won
God bless the Fire Bri-gade.

2.
No mat-ter how storm-y the night,
We wait not for morn-ing's light,
For the wel-come of all
Re-pays the call
that brings out the Fire Bri-gade.
And the arms of a girl or boy,
Will en-cir-cle our neck with joy,
For they see by the light the fire has made
That they're safe with the Fire Bri-gade
Then huz-zah, huz-zah, huz-zah,
Three cheers for cour-age es-say'd
And the no-ble name each mem-ber has won
God bless the Fire Bri-gade.

(CHORUS)
