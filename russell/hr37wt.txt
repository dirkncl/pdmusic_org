Tomb of the mighty dead, 
Sacred be every tree, 
That waves upon thy bed 
Or sheds its bloom on thee, 
While full Potomac flows, 
Bright ’neath Mount Vernon’s sun; 
Honor’d by friends and foes 
Rest here, Rest here, 
Rest here in soft repose, 
Washington! Washington! 
Sons of our Pilgrim Sires, 
Sons of our boundless West; 
Ye whom the tropick fires, 
Or the cold lakes lull to rest; 
Meet here as brothers meet, 
Round some lov’d hearth stone: 
Meet in Communion sweet,  
Meet in communion sweet, 
Here at your Father’s feet, 
Here at your Father’s feet: 
Washington! Washington! 
He of Helna’s rock hath an enduring name 
Echoed in Battle 
Echoed in battle’s shock 
Sculptur’d with blood 
Sculptur’d with blood, 
with blood, with blood, and shame. 
But when the mother at the knee 
Teacheth her cradled child 
Lessons of Liberty 
Lessons of Liberty. 
Shall he not lisp of thee, 
shall he not lisp of thee; 
Washington! Washington! 
Should bale-ful dis-cord steal 
Patriot strength away, 
Or fierce invasion’s zeal 
Restore old Bunkers day, 
Should baleful discord steal 
Our Patriot’s strength away, 
Or fierce invasion’s zeal 
Restore old Bunkers day 
Or mad disunion smite the tree 
That grows ’neath glory’s sun. 
What shall the watch word be, 
Rousing the true and free 
What shall the watch word be? 
What shall the watch word be? 
Rousing the true and free? 
What shall the watch word be? 
Rousing the true and free? 
What shall the watch word be? 
Rousing the true and free? 
Rousing the true and free? 
The true the true and free 
What shall the watch the watch word be? 
Rousing the true the true and free? 
what shall the watch the watch word be? 
Rousing the true the true and free 
Washington and liberty 
Washington and liberty 
Washington and liberty 
Washington and liberty.
