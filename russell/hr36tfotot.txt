1.
I am a Friar of Orders Grey,
And down in the Vallies I take my way,
I pull not Blackberry Haw or Hip,
Good store of Ven痴on does full my Scrip;
My long bead roll as I merily chaunt,
Wherever I walk no money I want;
Wherever I walk no money I want,
And why I知 so plump the reason I値l tell,
Who leads a good life is sure to live well.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
What Baron or Squire, or Knight of the shire
Lives half so well as a Holy Friar,
half so well, half so well,
half so well, as a Holy Friar
as a Holy Friar,
As a holy Friar,
As a holy Friar?

2.
After supper of Heaven, I dream,
But that is fat pullets and clouted cream,
Myself by denial I morti-fy;
With a dainty but ofa warden pie.
I知 clothed in sackloth for my sin,
With old sack wine I知 lined within;
With old sack wine I知 lined within;
A chirping cup in my matin song,
And the Vesper bell is my bowl ding dong.
