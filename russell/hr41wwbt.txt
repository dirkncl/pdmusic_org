1.
We were boys together,
And never can forget
The school-house near the heather,
In childhood where we met;
Nor the green home, to memory dear,
Its sorrows and its joys,
Which called the transcient smile or tear,
When you and I were boys!

2.
We were boys together,
And castles built in air!
Your heart was like a feather,
While mine was dash'd with care!
To you came wealth with manhood's prime,
To me it brought alloys.
Ne'er imaged in the primrose time,
When you and I were boys!

3.
We're old men together!
The friends we loved of yore
With leaves of autumn weather,
Are gone for ever more!
How blest to age the impulse given,
The hope, time ne'er destroys,
Which let our thoughts from earth to heaven
When you and I were boys!
