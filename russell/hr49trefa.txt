1.
What need of all this fuss and strife,
Each waring with his brother?
Why need we, through the crowd of life,
Keep trampling on each other?
Is there no goal that can be won
Without a squeeze to gain it,
No other way of getting on,
But scrambling to obtain it?

CHORUS
Oh! fellow men, remember then,
Whatever chance befal,
The world is wide in lands beside--
There's room enough for all!

2.
What if the swarthy peasant find
No field for honest labour?
He need not idly stop behind,
To thrust aside his neighbor!
There is a land with sunny skies,
Which gold for toil is giving,
Where ev'ry brawny hand that tries
Its strength can grasp a living.

CHORUS
Oh! fellow men, remember then,
Whatever chance befal,
The world is wide;--where those abide,
There's room enough for all!

3.
From poison'd air ye breathe in courts,
And typhus-tainted alleys,
Go forth, and dwell where health resorts,
In rural hills and valleys;
Where ev'ry hand that clears a bough
Finds plenty in attendance,
And ev'ry furrow of the plough
A step to independence.

CHORUS
Oh! hasten, then, from fever'd den,
And lodging cramp'd and small:
The world is wide in lands beside,--
There's room enough for all!

4.
In this fair region far away,
Will labor find employment--
A fair day's work, a fair day's pay,
And toil will earn enjoyment!
What need, then, of this daily strife,
Each waring with his brother;
Why need we in the crowd of life
Keep trampling down each other.

CHORUS
Oh! fellow men, remember then,
Whatever chance befal,
The world is wide;--where those abide,
There's room enough for all!
