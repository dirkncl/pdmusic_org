1.
Dear Mother, take me to the Ball to night,
My fond heart whispers he’ll be there,
Once more I’d mingle in the scenes so bright,
I lived along with him to share.

Brief was the radiance of that joyous day
For on our path a rival stole
From whose persuasion none can turn away,
And won from him my yield ing soul.

He dreamt not why I was so cold,
He could not read my heart aright.
’Tis you alone the knowledge hold.
Oh! take me to the Ball to night.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.


2.
My mother dear, the secret of my life
I have revealed to you alone
And why? when wooing me to be his wife
I answer’d in such chilling tone.

He knew not what we both but too well knew
Of knowing would not understand
That though our knitted hearts together grew,
I dared not give to him my hand.

He dreamt not why I was  so cold,
He could not read my heart aright.
’Tis you alone the knowledge hold.
Oh! take me to the Ball to night.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.

3.
Be happy Mother; smooth your anxious brow.
The future no regret can bring,
The radiant past is with me now,
For yet to one dear  thought I cling

That you will place me once more by his side.
My secret I shall not betray.
And let me look upon his fair young bride
And bless them ere  I pass away.

He dreamt not why I was so cold.
He could not read my heart aright.
’Tis you alone the knowledge hold.
Oh! take me to the Ball tonight.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.
  Mother, Mother, take me to the Ball tonight.
