1.
Upon the ocean flood,
His eyes bent on the deep,
A mournful exiled brother stood,
Too pain'd at heart to weep.
He knew one watch'd him from the shore,
That seemed a speck in air;
And oft he thought, 'mid ocean's roar,
He heard a sister's pray'r!

2.
It fell thus on his ear,
Like some sweet heavenly spell;
"Fate parts us now, O, brother dear,
Thou'st ta'an a last farewell.
The hopes and lights of life are fled,
They're lost in clouds of care;
My only joy's to bend my head
To God for thee in prayer!"

3.
Time o'er that sister's brow,
Had onward wing'd his flight,
But o'er her mind's dark shadows now
There bursts a beam of light
That brother she had mourn'd with tears,
Who left her in despair;
Returns to cheer her fading years,
And bless her for her prayer!
