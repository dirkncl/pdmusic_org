1.
Come brothers arouse, let the owl go to rest,
  Oh! the summer sun's in the sky,
The bee's on his wing and the hawk's in his nest,
  And the river runs merrily by;
  And the river runs merrily by.
Our mother, the world, a good mother is she,
  Says to toil, is to welcome her fare;
Some bounty she hangs us on every tree,
  And blesses us in the sweet Air, Oh!
Come brothers arouse, let the owl go to rest,
  Oh! the summer sun's in the sky,
The bee's on his wing and the hawk's in his nest,
  And the river runs merrily by;
  And the river runs merrily by.

CHORUS
Come dance lads, come dance lads,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Come dance lads, come dance lads,
Come dance, come dance
  away, away, away, away, away, away,
Oh, Oh.

2.
And this is the life for a man, a man,
  And this is the life for me.
The Prince may boast if he can, he can;
  But he never was half so free,
  But he never was half so free.
Our mother, the world, a good mother's she,
  Says to toil is to welcome her fare;
Some bounty she hangs us on every tree,
  And blesses us in the sweet air, Oh!
Come brothers arouse, let the owl go to rest,
  Oh! the summer sun's in the sky,
The bee's on his wing and the hawk's in his nest,
  And the river runs merrily by;
  And the river runs merrily by.

(CHORUS)
