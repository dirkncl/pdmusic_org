1.
In cold misfortune’s cheerless day,
  When joy and peace and love depart,
When friends deceive and hopes decay,
  And sorrows press the heavy heart,
  And sorrows press the heavy heart;
  Lord Thou cans’t a relief impart,
’Tis Thou canst cheer the wounded mind;
  ’Tis Thou canst heal affliction’s smart.
Teach us to pray and be resign’d,
Teach us to pray and be resigned.

2.
And O! should changeful fortune frown,
  Or those we love prove true no more,
Should death’s relentless hand cut down
  Those who returned the love we bore,
  Those who returned the love we bore.
  Still let us worship and adore
And seek the peace we yet may find:
  Teach us, O Father, we implore,
To trust in Thee, and be resigned!
To trust in Thee, and be resigned!
