1.
Oh! stranger, tread lightly, 'tis holy ground here,
In death's cold embrace the soldier sleepeth here.
On the red field of battle my brave comrads died,
And his last smile I caught as I knelt by his side.
Yes, his lips were a smile, and he fear'd not to die,
And his ear caught the shout as it rose to the sky--
"The vic'ty is ours!" his comrades cried,
"Thank God!" said the soldier, as smiling he died.

2.
With hearts full of grief we stood round his bier,
And each soldier's eye was moist with a tear;
And with sad, solemn step we marched to his grave,
And o'er our brave brother our flag we did wave.
Yes, slowly and sadly, we waved a farewell,
Tho' his spirit already in heavenly realms did dwell;
But his body we tearfully lowered 'neath there,
And the heart of the soldier did send forth a prayer.

3.
May God help his mother the sad blow to bear,
May God help the widow of him who lies 'neath here;
May He guard the orphans whose little hearts grieve,
That thus no more a father's fond kiss shall receive.
Then stranger, tread lightly, 'tis holy ground here,
In death's cold embrace, the soldier sleepeth there;
'Tis the grave of the hero, 'neath the grass-covered sod,
His spirit's in Heaven, at home with its God.
