1.
To the west! to the west! to the land of the free,
Where mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea,
Where a man is a man, if he's willing to toil,
And the humblest may gather the fruits of the soil.

Where children are blessings, and he who hath most,
Has aid for his fortune and riches to boast,
Where the young may exult, and the aged may rest,
away, far away, to the land of the west.

CHORUS
To the west! to the west! to the land of the free,
Where mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea
Where the young may exalt and the aged may rest
Away! far away! to the land of the west.

2.
To the west! to the west! where the rivers that flow,
Run thousands of miles spreading out as they go;
Where the green waving forests shall echo our call
As wide as all England and free to us all.

Where the Prairies like seas where the billows have roll'd,
Are broad as the kingdoms and empires of old
And the lakes are like oceans in storm or in rest
Away! far away! to the land of the west.

(CHORUS)

3.
To the west! to the west! there is wealth to be won,
The forest to clear is the work to be done:
Where the stars and the stripes like a banner unfurled,
Invites to its regions the world, all the world.

Where the people are true to the vows that they frame, 
And their pride is the honor that's shown to their name;
Away! far away! let us hope for the best,
And build up a home in the land of the west.

(CHORUS)
