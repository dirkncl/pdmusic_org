1.
Some love to roam o'er the dark was foam
Where the shrill winds whistle free;
But a chosen band in a mountain land,
And a life in the woods for me,
When the shrill winds whistle free;
But a chosen band in a mountain land
and a life in the woods for me.
When morning beams o'er the mountain streams
Oh! merrily forth we go
To follow the stag to his slippery crag
and to chase the bounding row
To follow the stag to his slippery crag
and to chase the bounding row.

CHORUS
Ho! ho! ho! ho ho! ho! ho!
Ho! ho! ho! ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Some love to roam o'er the dark sea foam,
When the shrill winds whistle free;
But a chosen band in a mountain land,
And a life in the woods for me!
and a life in the woods for me
and a life in the woods for me.

2.
The deer we mark through the forest dark,
And the prowling wolf we track,
And for right good cheer in the wild woods here,
Oh why should a hunter lack
For with already aim, at the bounding game,
And hearts, that fear no foe,
To the darksome glade in the forest shade,
Oh merrily forth we go.

(CHORUS)
