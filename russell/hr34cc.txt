VERSE
Now out upon this smiling,
No smile shall meet his sight,
And a word of light reviling
Is all he値l hear tonight.

Now out upon this smiling,
No smile shall meet his sight,
And a word of light reviling
Is all he値l hear tonight:

For he値l hold my smile too lightly
If he always sees me smile,
He値l think they shine more brightly,
When I have frowned a while.

[REFRAIN]
Now out upon this smiling,
No words shall meet his sight,
And a word of light reviling
Is all he値l hear tonight.
