Hush! 'tis the night-watch he guards my lonely cell;
Hush! 'tis the night-watch he guards my lonely cell;
Hush! 'tis the night watch
Hush! 'tis the night watch
Hush! hush he comes to guard, to guard my lonely cell;
'tis the nigh watch he guards my lonely cell.

He comes this way;
Yes! 'tis the night watch,
Yes! 'tis the night watch his glim'ring lamp I see!
Hush! 'tis the night watch, softly he comes,
hush, 'tis the nighwatch, softly he comes,
hush 'tis the nightwatch, softly he comes,
Hush! Hush!

No! by heaven no by heav'n I am not mad.
Oh! release me, Oh! release me,
No! by heaven, no by heav'n I am not mad.

I loved her sincerely,
I loved her too dearly,
I loved her in sorrow,
in joy and in pain;
but my heart is forbidden,
yest ever will waken,
The mem'ry of bliss will ne'er come again;
Oh! this poor heart is broken,
Oh! this poor heart is broken.

I see her dancing in the hall,
I see her dancing in the hall,
I see her dancing,
I see her dancing in the hall,
I see her dancing,
I see her,
I see her,
dancing in the hall,

I see her dancing, I see her dancing,
she heeds me not;
No! by heaven no by heav'n I am not mad;
Oh! release me, oh! release me,
no by heaven no by heav'n I am not mad.

He quits the grate, he turns the key,
He quits the grate, I knelt in vain,
his glim'ring lamp, still still I see,
and all, and all is gloom again;
Cold bitter cold, no life, no light;
life all thy comforts once I had,
but here I'm chained this freezing night;
No by heaven no by heav'n I am not mad;
Oh! release me, oh! release me,
no by heaven no by heav'n I am not mad.

I see her dancing in the hall,
I see her dancing in the hall,
She heeds me not, she heeds me not;
come come
she heeds me not.

For lo! you while I speak,
mark how you demons eyeballs glare;
he sees me now, with dreadful shriek he whirls,
he whirls me in the air.
Horror, the reptile strikes his tooth,
deep in my heart so crush'd and sad;
Aye! Laugh ye fiends, laugh laugh ye fiends,
Yes by heaven yes by heav'n they've driven me mad;
I see her dancing in the hall,
I ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I see her dancing in the hall.

Oh! release me,
Oh! release me,
She heeds me not,
Yes by heaven
yes by heav'n
they've driven me mad.
