1.
"Topsy neber was born,
Neber had a moder;
Specks I growed a nigger brat,
Just like any oder.
Whip me till the blood pours down
Ole Missus used to do it;
She said she'd cut my heart right out
But neber could get to it;
Got no heart I don't believe,
Niggers do without 'em,
Neber heard of God or love,
So can't tell much about 'em."

CHORUS
This is Topsy's savage song
Topsy cute and clever
Hurrah then for the white man's right
Slavery for ever!

2.
"I 'spects I'se very wicked,
That's jist what I am....
Only you jist give me chance,
Wont I rouse Ole Sam.
'Taint no use in being good
'Cos I'se black you see,
I neber car'd for nothin yet,
And nothin cares for me;
Ha, ha, ha, miss Feely's hand
Dun know how to grip me,
Neber likes to do no work
And wont without they whip me."

(CHORUS)

3.
"Don't you die Miss Evy,
Else I go dead too,
I knows I'se wicked, but I'll try
To be all good to you;
You have taught me better things,
Tho' I'se nigger skin,
You have found poor Topsy's heart,
Spite of all its sin,
Don't you die, Miss Evy dear,
Else I go dead too,
Tho's I'se black, I'se sure that God,
Will let me go with you."

CHORUS
This is Topsy's human song,
Under Love's endeavour,
Hurrah then for the white child's work,
Humanity for ever!
