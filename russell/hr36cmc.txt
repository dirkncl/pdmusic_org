1.
Come maidens come to our merry dance,
At quiet evening’s sweetest hour;
Let young hearts meet in converse sweet,
In Beauty’s cool and summer bow’r.

By the pale light of the thoughtful moon,
When all is hush’d save the sighing breeze;
In a still and balmy night of June,
Under the leaves of the Linden trees.
Under the leaves of the Linden trees.

O come maidens come to our merry dance,
At quiet evening’s sweetest hour;
Let young heart’s meet in converse sweet,
In Beauty’s cool and summer bow’r.

2.
There song shall awake its softest tones,
To pleasure op’ning all the soul,
At silent eve, our feet shall weave
The jocund deance while its echoes roll.

Come maidens come when the night bird’s tune
Is wafted afar on the gentle breeze;
Come to our dance when the watchful moon
Shines thro’ the leaves of the Linden trees.
Shines thro’ the leaves of the Linden trees.

O come maid-ens come to our mer-ry dance,
At qui-et eve-ning’s sweet-est hour;
Let young hearts meet in con-verse sweet;
In Beau-ty’s cool and sum-mer bow’r.
