1.
I'm afloat! I'm afloat! on the fierce rolling tide.
The ocean's my home, and my bark is my bride!
Up! up! with the flag! let it wave o'er the sea,
I'm afloat! I'm afloat! and the rover is free!
I fear not the monarch, I heed not the law;
I've a compass to steer by, a dagger to draw;
And ne'er as a coward or a slave will I kneel,
While my guns carry shot, or my belt bears a steel!
Quick! quick! trim her sails; let her sheets kiss the wind
And I warrant we'll soon leave the seagulls behind;
Up! up! with my flag! let it wave o'er the sea!
I'm afloat! I'm afloat! and the rover is free!
I'm afloat! I'm afloat! and the rover is free!


2.
The night gathers o'er us, the thunder is heard;
What matter, our vessel skims on like a bird;
What to her is the dash of the storm ridden main?
She has brav'd it before, and will brave it again!
The fire-gleaming flashes around us may fall;
They may strike, they may cleave, but they cannot appal;
With lighnings above us, and darkness below,
Through the wild [wave?] of waters right onward we go;
Hurrah! my brave boys, ye may drink, ye may sleep,
The storm fiend is hush'd, we're alone on the deep --
Our flag of defiance still waves o'er the sea,
Hurrah! boys hurrah! the rover is free!
Hurrah! boys hurrah! the rover is free!
