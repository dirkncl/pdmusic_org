1.
Old nature with a matchless hand, sends forth her nobly horn,
And laughs the paltry attributes of wealth and rank to scorn;
She moulds, with care a spirit rare, half human, half divine,
And cries exalting, "who can make a gentleman like mine"!

2.
Should fortune pour her welcome store, And usefull gold abound,
He shares it with a bounteous hand And scatters blessings round,
The treasure sent is righlyly spent, And serves the end design'd,
When held by natures Gentlemen, the good, the just, the kind.

3.
He turns not from the cheerless home, where sorrow's of spring dwell;
He'll grett [greet?] the Peasant in his hut _ the Culprit in his cell,
He stays to hear the Widow's plaint of deep and mourning love,
He seeks to aid her lot below, and promise her faith above.

4.
He wounds no breast with jeer, or jest, yet bears no honied tongue,
He's social wit hte gray hair'd one, and merry with the young!
He gravely shares the Council speech or joins the rustic game,
And shines as natures Gentleman, in every place the same.

5.
There are some spirits nobly just, unwrap'd by pelf or pride,
Great is the calm but greater still when dash'd by adverse tide -
They hold the rank no King can give, no station can disgrace,
Nature puts forth her Gentleman, and monarch must give place.

6.
He worships God with inward zeal, and serves him in each deed,
He would not blame another's faith, nor have one martyr bleed,
Justice and mercy form his code; he puts his trust in heaven,
His prayer, is "if the heart means well, may all else be forgiven".
