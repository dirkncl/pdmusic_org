Charter Oak! charter Oak! tell us a tale,
Of the years that have fled, like the leaves on the gale,
For thou bear'st a brave arm on thy brown root and stem,
And thy heart was a casket for Liberty's gem.
Speak out in thy wisdom oracular tree,
And we and our children will listen to thee,
For the love of the a-ged is dear in our eyes
Thy leaves and the acorns as relic's we prize.
Charter Oak! charter Oak! tell us a tale,
Of the years that have fled like the leaves on the gale,
For thou bear'st a brave arm on thy brown root and stem,
And thy heart was a casket for Liberty's gem.

I see them, they come,
The dim ages of old,
The sires of our nation,
True-hearted, and bold,
The axe of the woodman
Rings sharp thro' the glade,
And the warm Indian hunter
Reclines in the shade.
I see them, they come!
The grey fathers are there,
Who won from the forest
This heritage fair,
With their high trust in heaven
They suffer'd or toil'd,
Both the tempest and tyrant
Unbleching thy foll'd
Charter Oak! charter Oak! ancient and fair,
Thou did'st guard of our freedom
The rudiment rare,
So, a crown of green leaves
Be thy gift, noble tree,
With the love of the brave,
And the thanks of the free.
