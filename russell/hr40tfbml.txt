Merrily, merrily, merrily, oh!
The nets are spread out to the sun;
Oh! Merrily oh! the fisher boy sings,
Right glad that his labour's done Oh!

Merrily, merrily, merrily, oh!
The nets are spread out to the sun;
Oh! Merrily oh! the fisher boy sings,
Right glad that his labour's done.

Happy and gay with his boat in the bay.
The storm and the danger forgot;
The wealthy and grand might repine at their state,
And envy the fisher boy;s lot ... Oh!

[CHORUS]
Merrily, merrily, merrily, oh!
The burden thus he gives;
Oh! Cheerily oh! the blast may blow,
The fisher boy merrily lives; la la la

Merrily, merrily, merrily, oh!
He sleeps till the morning breaks;
Oh! Merrily oh! at the sea gull's scream,
The fisher boy quickly awakes, Oh ...

Merrily, merrily, merrily, oh!
He sleeps till the morning breaks;
Oh! merrily oh! at the sea gull's scream,
the fisher boy quickly awakes.

Down on the strand he is plying his hand,
His shouting is heard again;
The clouds are dark, but he springs to his bark
With some light hearted swim; Oh! ...

(CHORUS)
