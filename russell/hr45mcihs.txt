1.
Many changes I have seen,
Over many lands I've been,
And I've learn'd a thing in my time,
I never knew a knave
Who went happy to the grave,
Or reach'd the mountain top he meant to climb.
Tho' I've travell'd far and wide,
And have waited time and tide,
I never knew Dishonesty to win,
Or a heart however hard,
From all sympathy debarr'd,
Or that kindness could not touch and enter in.

2.
Never yet in all my round,
Though I've sought him, have I found
A thriving man contented with his gold
Or the children of the just,
Lying homeless in the dust,
Without a friend to shield them from the cold.
Never yet would I discern,
Though I've struggled hard to learn
That the rich could bolt out sorrow from the door;
Or that Wisdom very wise
In its own and other's eyes,
Did not curse some little folly at the core.

3.
Never yet I knew a man
Who made other's good his plan,
Who was not overpaid in peace of mind;
Nor a worshipper of self,
And a scraper-up of pelf,
Whose treasures were not scatter'd to the wind!
And now my song is done,
Here's success to ev'ry one
Who plays, through all his life, a manly part!
And be blessings round them flung,
Be they old or be they young,
Who unite the willing hand and loving heart.
