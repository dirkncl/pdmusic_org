1.
She heard the fight was over,
And won the wreath of fame!
When tidings from her lover,
With his good war-steed came,
To guard her safely to his tent,
The redmen of the woods were sent,
They led her where sweet waters gush
Under the pine tree bough!
The tomahowk is raised to crush--
'Tis buried in her brow!
She sleeps, she sleeps,
beneath that pine tree now!

2.
Her broken-hearted lover
In hopeless conflict died!
The forest leaves now cover
That soldier and his bride!
The frown of the Great Spirit fell
Upon the red-men like a spell!
No more those waters slake their throat,
Shadeless to them that tree!
O'er land and lake roam accurst,
And in the clouds they see
Thy spirit! thy spirit unavenged, McRea!
