Life saver! Wave stemmer!
Deep diver! away!
Night's shadows are closing
The portals of day;
On the breast of the billow
We hear his low wail,
We have put up the rudder,
And furl'd up the sail.

No signal from Heaven
Will show wher, be be;
And where e'er he be driven,
We men cannot see.

Ho! Carlo! Newfoundland!
Go follow his cry,
As it gaspingly answers
The sea moaners sigh;

The boat shall be lower'd,
The men shall belay,

Life saver! Wave stemmer!
Deep diver, away!

[Interlude]

Away! fetch him out!
fetch him up! seize him! ho!
Mount the wave dog! mount the wave dog! ha!
down down below!

Hark! watch! bear a hand ---
bring a light
not a sound
bring a light
Hark! there's a moan.

[Bridge]
Yes the waves moaning over the drown'd
God's spirit preserve him,
Amen and amen.

Hist! a flash and a motion---
Ha! carlo, Ha! carlo, again,
Good dog, then, good dog, then
Bear a hand, then, pull tight,---
A boat hook a boat hook,
He's in and all right;
Come, Carlo, quick, follow,
Fine fellow hard strife,
Wave stemmer!
Deep diver! we owe you a life.

[Interlude]
