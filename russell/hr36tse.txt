1.
The sabbath eve, at that soft hour, 
When day tho’ lost to gazing eyes, 
Still o’er the heart exerts its pow’r, 
Ah then what sweet emotions rise! 
When pray’r united seeks the skies, 
When music and devotion blend, 
And heav’n and earth their melodies 
Into each other mingling send! 
The Sabbath Eve at that soft hour, 
When day tho’ lost to gazing eyes, 
Still o’er the heart exerts its pow’r, 
Ah then what sweet emoions rise! 

2.
Oh, if there be a heav’n below 
A type of Paradise complete, 
’Tis when Religion’s accents flow, 
Round some lov’d hearth where many meet; 
When ev’ry heart, in ev’ry beat, 
Breathes peace within, and peace abroad, 
And all are there who love to greet, 
Save that soft hour, who rest with God!      
Oh, if there be a heav’n below, 
A type of Paradise complete, 
’Tis when Religion’s accents flow, 
Round some lov’d hearth where many meet.
