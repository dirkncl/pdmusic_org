1.
Rouse! Bro-thers rouse! the way is long be-fore us,
Free as the winds we love to roam,
Far thro' the prai-rie, far thro' the fo-rest!
O-ver the moun-tains we'll find a home.
We can-not breathe in crowd-ed ci-ties,
We're strang-ers to the ways of trade;
We long to feel the grass be-neath us,
And ply the hatch-et and the spade.

[REFRAIN]
Rouse Bro-thers! rouse! the way is long be-fore us,
Free as the wind's we love to roam,
Far thro' the prai-rie, far thro' the fo-rest!
O-ver the moun-tains we'll find a home.

CHORUS
Rouse Bro-thers! rouse! the way is long be-fore us,
Free as the wind's we love to roam,
Far thro' the prai-rie, far thro' the fo-rest!
O-ver the moun-tains we'll find a home.


2.
Mea-dows and hills and an-cient wood-lands
Of-fer us pas-ture, fruit, and corn,
Need-ing our pre-sence, court-ing our la-bour;
Why should we lin-ger like men for-lorn?
We love to hear the ring-ing ri-fle,
The smit-ing axe, the fall-ing tree;
And tho' our life be rough and lone-ly,
If it be ho-nest what care we?

REFRAIN
Rouse! Bro-thers rouse! the way is long be-fore us,
Free as the wind we love to roam,
Far thro' the prai-rie, far thro' the fo-rest!
O-ver the moun-tains we'll find a home.

(CHORUS)

3.
Fair el-bow-room for mem to thrive in!
Wide el-bow-room for work or play!
If ci-ties fol-low, track-ing our foot-steps,
E-ver to west-ward shall point our way!
Rude tho' our life it suits our spi-rit,
And new-born states in fu-ture years
Shall own us foun-ders of a na-tion,
And bless the har-dy "Pi-o-neers."

REFRAIN
Rouse Bro-thers! rouse! the way, is long be-fore us,
Free as the winds we love to roam,
Far thro' the prai-rie, far thro' the fo-rest!
O-ver the moun-tains we'll find a home.

(CHORUS)
