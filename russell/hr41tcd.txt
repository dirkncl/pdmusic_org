1.
Upon the barren sand,
A single captive stood,
Around him came with bow and brand,
The redmen of the wood.
Like him of old, his doom he hears,
Rock-bound on ocean's rim: 
The chieftain's daughter knelt in tears,
And breathed a prayer for him.

2.
Above his head in air,
The savage warclub swung;
The frantic girl, in wild despair,
Her arms about him flung.
Then shook the warriors of the shade,
Like leaves on aspen limb,
Subdued by that heroic maid
Who breathed a prayer for him.

3.
"Unbind him!" gasped the chief,
"It is your king's decree!"
He kissed away her tears of grief,
And set the captive free.
'Tis ever thus, when, life's storm,
Hope's star to man grows dim,
An angel kneels in woman's form,
And breathes a prayer for him.
