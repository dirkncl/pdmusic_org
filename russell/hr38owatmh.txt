1.
When the tempests fly o'er the cloudy sky
And the piping blast sings merrily
Oh sweet is the mirth of hte social hearth
Where the flames are blazing cheerily

Our way across the mountains ho ...
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
Our way across teh mountains ho
ho ho ho

The moonbeam bright of a summer's night
Shineth but sad and wearily
But sweet is the glow where contentment flows
And the fire blazes cheerily

Oh when the tempests fly o'er the cloudy sky
When the tempests fly o'er the cloudy sky
And the piping blast sings merrily
Oh sweet is the mirth of hte social hearth
Where the flames are blazing cheerily

Our way across the mountains ho ...
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
Our way across teh mountains ho
ho ho ho ho
Our way across the mountains ho
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
Our way across the mountains ho
ho ho ho ho.

Let the storms without in their midnout rout
Howl through the casement drearily
We're merry within round the blazing Ilnn
Where contentment flows right cheerily

Our way across the mountains ho
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
Our way accoss the mountains ho
ho ho ho ho

The moonbeam bright of a summer's night
shineth but sad and merrily
But sweet is the glow where contentment flows
And the bright fire blazes cheerily

Oh when the tempests fly o'er the cloudy sky
And the piping blast sings merrily
Oh sweet is the mirth of the social hearth
Where the flames are blazing cheerily

our way across the mountains ho
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
our way across the mountins ho
ho ho ho ho
our way across the mountains ho
ho ho ho ... ho ho ho
our way across the mountains ho
