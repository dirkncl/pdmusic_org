1.
Sir Harold the Hunter, was rarely seen,
At rest in his lordly home,
But roughly clad in his forest-er's green,
Far over the hills he'd roam.
Far o ver the hills he'd roam. 
With his hounds and his bugle he greeted the dawn, 
Tracing the roebuck's track; 
Oft was he seen at the rosy morn, 
With the wild fawn slung at his back. 
Then merrily caroll'd the bold young knight, 
No love, no bride for me, 
I'll never go wooing to beauty bright, 
But live as a hunter free, 
But live as a hunter free, 
But live as a hunter free. 

2.
Sir Harold the hunter, what ails him now? 
His beautiful dogs are at play; 
He has thrown aside the twanging bow, 
His tunic is courtly and gay! 
His tunic is courtly and gay. 
His quiver is hung where the barbs may rust, 
On high with his hunting spear; 
His echoing bugle is cover'd in dust, 
And a softer note come near. 
Sir Harold is singing beneath the moon, 
"List dearest Ella, to me! 
Life to thy Knight is a joyless boon, 
If he's parted long from thee, 
If he's parted long from thee, 
If he's parted long from thee." 

3.
Sir Harold the hunter is often known 
To go forth at the sunset hour; 
He roves in the twilight, but roves not alone, 
He leads a fair maid from her bow'r. 
He leads a fair maid from her bow'r.  
He has doff'd his belt and forrester's green, 
And shines in a bridal suit; 
Wooing, and wedding, are there I ween, 
With the priest, the dance, and the lute. 
Merrily carols the gay young knight, 
"Love and my bride for me! 
'Tis better to kneel to beauty bright, 
Than live as a hunter free, 
Than live as a hunter free, 
Than live as a hunter free."
