1.
Ga-ther, ye Na-tions, ga-ther!
From forge and mine and mill!
Come Sci-ence and In-ven-tion;
Come In-dus-try and Skill!
Come with your wo-ven won-ders,
The blos-soms of the loom,
That ri-val Na-ture's fai-rest flow'rs
In all but their per-fume;
Come with your brass and i-ron,
Your sil-ver and your gold,
And arts that change the face of earth,
Un-known to men of old.
Ga-ther ye, Na-tions, ga-ther!
From ev'-ry clime and soil,
The same Con-fed-a-ra-tion,
The Ju-bi-lee of toil.

2.
We strive not for do-min-ion;--
Who-e'er the wor-thi-est be,
Shall bear the palm and gar-land,
And crown of vic-tor-y.
In kind-ly em-u-la-tion
His will-ing hand we'll seek,
And own him bro-ther, and a friend,
What e-ver tongue he speak,
What e'er his clime or na-tion,
His lin-iage or his creed,
To him shall hon-our due be given
For hon-our-a-ble deed.
Ga-ther, ye Na-tions, ga-ther!
Ex-alt them_ for you can_
The dig-ni-ty of la-bour,
The bro-ther-hood of man.

3.
The world is grow-ing wis-er,
New thoughts and hopes are born;
Too long we've dwelt in dark-ness,
And tar-ried for the morn.
Too long in fool-ish war-fare
We've dipp'd our bleed-ing hands
But wis-dom, taught by suffer-ing keen,
Comes beam-ing o'er the lands.
Our princ-es and our peo-ple
The grate-ful truth have learned,
And strive for glo-ry, pur-er far
Than bat-tles ev-er earned.
Ga-ther, ye Na-tions, ga-ther!
Let an-cient dis-cords cease,
And earth, with myr-iad voi-ces,
A-wake the song of Peace.
