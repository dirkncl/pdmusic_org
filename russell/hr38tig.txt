1.
A dainty plant is the Ivy green that
creepeth o'er ruins old --
Of right choice food are his meals
I ween in his cell so lone and cold
The wall must be crumbled the stones decayed
to pleasure his dainty whim
And the mould'ring dust that years have made
is a merry meal for him
Creeping where no life is seen
a rare old Plant is the Ivy green
Creeping where no life is seen
A rare old Plant is the Ivy green
Creeping creeping creeping where no life is seen
Creeping creeping
A rare old Plant is the Ivy green

2.
Fast he stealeth though he wears no wings,
And a stanch old heart has he,
How closely he twineth, how closely he clings,
To his friend the huge Oak Tree!
And silly he traileth along the ground,
And his leaves he gently waves,
As he joyously hugs and crawleth round
The mould of dead men's graves.
Creeping where grim death has been,
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
Creeping where no life is seen,
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.
Creeping, creeping, creeping where no life is seen
creeping, creeping, a rare old plant is the Ivy green.

3.
Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,
And nations have scattered been;
But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,
From its hale and hearty green.
The brave old plant in its lonely days,
Shall fatten upon the past;
For the stateliest building man can raise,
Is the Ivy's food at last,
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant the Ivy green,
creeping where no life is seen,
a rare old plant is the Ivy green,
creeping, creeping, creeping where no life is seen,
creeping, creeping, a rare old plant is the Ivy green.
