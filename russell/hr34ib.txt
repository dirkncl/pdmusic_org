VERSE
Oh! recall that the past, though this valley be filled
With all we remember and all we regret,
The flow’rs of its summer have long been disstilled,
The essence has perished, ah, let us forget!
What avails it to mourn over hours that are gone?
O’er illusions by youth and by phantasy nurst?
Alas! of the few that are lingering,
None wear the lights or the hues that encircled the first.

[REFRAIN]
Oh, recall not the past, though this valley be filled
With all we remember and all we regret.
The flow’rs of its summer have long been distilled,
The essence has perished: ah, let us forget!
