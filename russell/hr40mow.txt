[NOTE: Regrettably my source is missing the lyrics to the first
four measures of the first verse.]

1.
Old wife [...]
  And her voice has lost the sweetness, of its girlhood’s silv’ry tone,
But her heart is still as cheerful, as in early days of life,
  And as fondly as I priz’d my bride, I love my dear old wife!

2.
When the spring of life was in its bloom, and hope gave zest to youth,
  We at the sacred altar stood and plighted vows of truth.
And since though changeful years have pass’d, with joys and sorrows rife,
  Yet never did I see a change, in her my dearful wife!

3.
Her gentle love my cares have sooth’d, her smiles each joy enhanc’d,
  As fondly through progressive years together we’ve advanc’d,
Tho’ calmly now the current flows, we’ve known misfortunes strife,
  Yet ever did she cheer my woes, my faithful fond old wife!

4.
And ever since the joyous day, I bless’d her as my bride,
  In joy or sorrow, calm or storm, I found her at my side;
And when the summons from above, shall close the scene of life
  May I be called to rest with thee, my good, my dear Old Wife!
