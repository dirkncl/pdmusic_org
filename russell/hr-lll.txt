1.
Land! Land! Land!
The dangers of the deep are past,
We're drawing near our home at last,
We see its outline on the sky,
And join the sailor's welcome cry:
Land! Land! Land!
Oh! joyful thought for weary men,
To tread the solid earth again,
And hark! the church bells pealing near,
From spire and turret, loud and clear,
As if they rang so loud and free,
To bid us welcome o'er the sea.
Land! Land! Land!
The dangers of the deep are past,
We're drawing near our home at last,
We see its outline on the sky,
And join the sailor's welcome cry:
Land! Land! Land!

2.
Land! Land! Land!
The cry makes ev'ry heart rejoice;
Is this the country of our choice?
Is this the long sought happy soil,
Where plenty spreads the board of toil?
Land! Land! Land!
How gladly through its paths we'll tread,
With bounding step, uplifted head,
And through its wilds and to rests roam,
To clear our farms, to build our home;
And sleep at night and never dread,
That morn shall see us wanting bread.
Land! Land! Land!
The cry makes ev'ry heart rejoice,
Is this the country of our choice?
Is this the long sought happy soil,
Where plenty spreads the board of toil?
Land! Land! Land!

Land! Land! Land!
We've pass'd together o'er the sea,
In storm and sunshine, comrades we,
But ere we part let's gather round,
And shout with one accord, the sound,
Land! Land! Land!
The land of rivers broad and deep,
The land where he we sows may reap;
The land, where if we ploughmen will,
We may possess the fields we till,
So gather all, and shout once more,
The land, the land, Hurrah for shore!
Land! Land! Land!
We've pass'd together o'er the sea,
In storm and sunshine, comrades we,
But ere we part let's gather round,
And shout with one accord, the sound,
Land! Land! Land!
