1.
Old Ironsides at anchor lay,
In the harbor of Mahong
A dead calm rested us on the bay.
The waves to sleep had gone;
When little Hal, the Captain's son,
A lad both brave and good,
In sport, up shrond and rigging run,
And on the main-truck stood!

2.
A shudder shot through ev'ry vein.
All eyes were turn'd on high!
There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,
Between the sea and sky!
No hold had he above -- below!
Alone he stood in air!
At that far height dar'd to go --
At that far height dar'd to go --
No aid could reach him there.

3.
We gaz'd -- but not a man could speak!
With horror all aghast
In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,
We watch'd the quiv'ring mast.
The atmosphere grew thick and hot,
And of a lurid hue,
As, rivited unto the spot,
Stood officers and crew.
We gaz'd -- but not a man could speak!
We gaz'd -- but not a man could speak!
Not a man could speak.

4.
The Father came on deck!
He gasp'd, "Oh God! thy will be done!"
Then suddenly a rifle grasp'd,
And aim'd it at his son!
"Jump, far out, boy! into the wave!
Jump, or I fire!" he said!
"That only chance your life can save!
Jump -- jump boy!"
He obey'd,
He sunk -- he rose -- he liv'd - he mov'd --
And for the ship struck out!
On board we hail'd the lad belov'd,
On board we hail'd the lad belov'd,
On board we hail'd the lad belov'd,
On board we hail'd the lad belov'd,
With many, with many a manly shout.

5.
His Father drew, in silent joy,
Those wet arms round his neck,
Then folded to his heart the boy,
And fainted on the deck.
