RECITAVIVO
Praise the Lord, oh! my soul!
Praise the Lord, oh! my soul!
And all that is within me
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name!
Praise his holy name! his name!

1.
Thou art, O God! the fount divine,
  From whence all earthly blessings flow;
Where-e'er we turn, thy glories shine,
  And all things praise thee here below;
The radiant sun which gilds the day,
  The countless stars that gem the night,
Owe all their splendor to thy sway,
  Great source of all things fair and bright;
If pilgrim pray'rs awail on high,
  All things adore thee! so do I.

2.
Thou reign'st, O God! in realms of light,
  Majestic, solemn and alone!
In adoration to thy might
  Creation bends beneath thy throne;
The thunder's roar, the lightning's glare,
  The murm'ring of the boundless see,
Are but the universal pray'r
  Which nature offers up to Thee!
If pilgrim thoughts ascend on high,
  All things adore Thee! so do I.

3.
We hail O God! the vital ray
  With holy inspiration rife__
Its bright reflection points the way
  Which leads to everlasting life;
The changing seasons as they roll,
  Thy power and wisdom, Lord, proclaim!
All creatures join from pole to pole,
  In loud hosannas to thy name;
If pilgrim pray'rs are heard on high,
  All things adore Thee!__ so do I.
