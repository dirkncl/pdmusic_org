1.
One day just at the set of sun,
Oh when de work was did and done;
I took my banjo and I played,
Betwext de sunshine and de shade;
Oh come along home, my pretty girls;
For de ebening sun’s declining:
Oh come along home, my pretty girls;
For de dew on de grass am shining.

2.
That little bird upon yon tree;
With one eye looks right down on me,
Fast on de branch de fellow hung,
And in dis chorus sweetly sung:
Oh show your face my dearest one,
For de ebening sun’s declining;
Oh show your face, my own true one,
For de dew on de grass am shining.

3.
I cast my eyes up to above,
And dare I saw my heabenly love;
I fell right down upon my knee
I look at her she look at me
I see you now my dearest one
And de ebening sun’s declining
Good night good night my own true love
For de dew on de grass am shining.
