1.
I’m single yet­­ I'm single yet,
And years have flown since I came out!
In vain I sigh­­ In vain I fret!
Ye gods! ye gods!
what what what are the men about!
I vow I’m twenty!­­ Oh! ye powers!­­
A spinster’s lot is hard to bear!
On earth alone to pass her hours!
And afterwards lead apes­­ down there!

2.
No offer yet! No offer yet!
I’m sure, I’m sure I cannot make it out!
For every beau my cap I set,
What what what
what what what what are the men about!
They don’t propose! they won’t propose!
For fear, perhaps, I’d not say “yes”!
I wish they’d try, for heaven knows,
I’m tired of single single blessedness!

3.
Not married yet! not married yet!
Heigh-ho! alas! and well a-day!
A hand of snow­­ an eye of jet,
Are all I have
are all I have to give away!
They say “she’s pret-ty, but no chink!”
With hand extended thus, they flout;
“There’s nothing green in me, I think!”
Or “Does your mother know you’re out!”
