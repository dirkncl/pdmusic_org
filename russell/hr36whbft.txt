1.
We have been friends together,
In sunshine and in shade,
Since first beneath the chestnut tree,
In infancy we played.
But coldness dwells within thy heart,
A cloud is on thy brow;
We have been friends together,
Can a light word part us now?

2.
We have been gay together,
We laugh'd at little jests;
For the fount of hope was gushing
Warm and joyous in our breasts;
But laughter now hath fled thy lip,
And sullen glooms thy brow,
We have been gay together,
Shall a light word part us now?

3.
We have been sad together
We have wept with bitter tears
O'er the grass grown graves where slumber'd
The hopes of early years:
The voices which are silent there
Would bid thee clear thy brow;
We have been sad together
Oh! what shall part us now?
