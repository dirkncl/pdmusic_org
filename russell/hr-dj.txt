1.
I dreamt dear Janet that all the earth,
Bow'd down to thy beauty's might.
The flashing meteor in heaven had birth,
Yet envied thine eyes -- sweet light;
The rosy dawn, and the blushing eve,
To thee their light consign.
The Nightengale left its rose to sing,
To ty cheek its song divine,
Dear Janet, Dear Janet.

2.
And then the Zephyr its spirit dress'd
In the perfume of sweet flow'rs.
And joyously to thy cheek it press'd,
And thy tresses made its bow'rs;
It fann'd thy face, and in dream-like bliss
It pour'd forth its gentle lay,
As it stole from thy roseate lips a kiss,
Softly sighing seem'd to say,
Dear Janet, Dear Janet.

3.
When the Frost withers I'll steep my wings
In the balm of the southern skies.
And to cool thy brow in summers heat
In realms where the cold snow lies;
And then I chang'd to the Zephyr dear,
I knelt at thy beauty's shrine.
And in transport and passion breath'd th love,
Of a heart that is wholly thine,
Dear Janet, Dear Janet.
