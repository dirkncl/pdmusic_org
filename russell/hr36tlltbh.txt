1. The la-dy leaves the ban-quet hall,
The hall of mirth and song;
Still, as the night, her light steps fall,
The mar-bled plain a-long,
But oft she starts, as the Mos-lem harps,
Ring forth their joy-ous, joy-ous strain;
And the la-dy sighs, to list that sound,
She may ne-ver, ne-ver hear a-gain.
She may ne-ver, ne-ver hear a-gain.
The la-dy leaves the fes-tive hall,
The hall of Dance and Song;
Light-ly her trem-bling foot-steps fall,
the shi-ning Courts a-long.

2. Where doth she glide so si-lent-ly,
From those who love her well.
Why did she shun her fa-ther’s eye,
When chim’d the mid-night bell?
Ask the young Knight who reins his steed,
Be-side yon por-tal low;
She hath be-come the Chris-tians bride,
And from Pa-les-tine they go!
And from Pa-les-tine, from Pa-les-tine they go.
For him she steals so si-lent-ly,
From the bow-er of her birth;
To seek a home in Christ-en-dy,
Far from her sun-ny earth.
