1.
Row gently row we mark the gleam
The sun's last ray flings o'er the stream
The breezes sleep there's not a breath
The glassy wave is still as death
The glassy wave is still as death
The glassy wave is still as death

Row gently row we mark the gleam
The sun's last ray flings o'er the stream
The breazes sleep there's not a breath
The glassy wave is still as death
The glassy wave is still as death
The glassy wave is still as death

Save where the ripples track our oar
Or light waves kiss the pebbled shore
where the ripples track our oar
Or light waves kiss the pebbled shore
Row comrades row row onward row
How swiftly o'er the stream we go
The breezes sleep there's not a breath
The glassy wave is still as death
there's not a breath, there's not a breath,
The glassy wave is still as death
there's not a breath there's not a breath
The glassy wave is still as death

[CHORUS]
Onward row, my comrades row
How swiftly o'er the stream we go
Row onward row my comrades row
How swiftly o'er the stream we go
Row row
row Corsairs row
Row row
row Corsairs row
Row row
Row Corsairs row
row Corsairs row
row Coarsairs row.

2. [to be applied the the verse "scheme" above]
Row gently row we glide along
The silent shore with gladsome song
The dark blue tides o'er which we bound
With our light laugh and mirth resound
Till from the distant convents tower
We hear the holy vesper hour

(CHORUS)
