1.
Though today be dark and dreary,
And black clouds around us rise,
Let us halt not, nor be weary,
Light is looming in the skies!
Aid and cheer each fellow creature,
’Gainst the storms that round us lour,
Soon they’ll wear a brighter feature
And the sunshine come with pow’r.

CHORUS [played twice after each verse]
Never, boys, give way to sorrow,
But be up and act like men;
Look with hope for joy tomorrow,
Sunny days will come again!

2.
Let us throw aside all sadness,
Better times are on the wing;
Who can tell what joy and gladness,
Providence to us may bring?
Nerve, then, evry manly feeling,
And with courage meet the storm;
Let us wounded hearts be healing,
And our duty still perform.

3.
We should not be always sighing,
Nor indulge in wild dismay;
Bear in mind “Old Time” is flying,
Therefore wisdom more display.
If our prospects be not shining
And our hearts be bow'd with care­­
Where’s the good in our repining?
Still look up and ne’er despair.
