1.
Tell me not of sparkling gems
Set in regal diadems;
You may boast your diamonds rare,
Rubles bright and pearls so fair;
But there's a peerless gem on earth,
Of richer ray and purer worth.
'Tis priceless, but 'tis worn by few.
It is the heart that's true.

2.
Bring the tulip and the rose,
While their brilliant beauty glows;
Let the storm-cloud fling a shade,
Rose and tulip both will fade;
But there's a flow'r that still is found,
When mist and darkness close around.
Changeless, fadeless in its hue --
It is the heart that's true.

3.
Ardent in its earliest tie,
Faithful in its latest sigh;
Love and Friendship, godlike pair,
Find their throne of glory there.
Proudly scorning bribe and threat,
Nought can break the seal once set;
All the evil gold can do,
Cannot warp the heart that's true.

4.
First in Freedom's cause to bleed,
First in joy when slaves are freed;
Their hearts were true, and what could quell
The might of Washington or Tell!
Oh! there is one mortal shrine
Lighted up with rays divine.
Seek it, yield the homage due.
Deify the heart that's true.
