1.
Up, up with the signal! -- the land is in sight! --
We'll be happy, if never again, boys, tonight!
The cold cheerless ocean in safety we've passed,
And the warm, genial earth glads our vision at last.
  And the warm, genial earth glads our vision at last.
In the land of the stranger true hearts we shall find
To soothe us in absence of those left behind.

CHORUS
Oh! Land land, ho! -- all hearts bound with joy at the sight!
We'll be happy, if never again boys tonight!
We'll be happy, if never again boys tonight!
We'll be happy if never again boys tonight!
We'll be happy again boys tonight!

2.
The signal is waving! -- Till morn we'll remain,
Then part in the hopes to meet one day again
Round the hearth-stone of home, in the land of our birth,
The ho-liet spot on the face of the earth!
  The ho-liet spot on the face of the earth!
Dear country! our thoughts are as constant to thee
As the steel in the star or the stream on the sea!

CHORUS
Oh! Land land ho! we near it we bound at the sight!
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy again, boys, tonight!

3.
The signal is answered! -- the gay sparkles rise
Like tears, from the fountain of joy, to the eyes;
May rain-drops that fall from the storm-clouds of care,
Melt away in the sun-beaming smiles of the fair!
  Melt away in the sun-beaming smiles of the fair!
Our health is the chime of the nautical bells,
To woman -- God bless her! and the land is in sight!

CHORUS
Oh! The pilot's on board and the land is in sight!
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy if never again, boys, tonight,
We'll be happy again, boys, tonight!
