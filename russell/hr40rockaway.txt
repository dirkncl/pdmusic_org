1.
On old Long Island's sea girt shore,
Many an hour I've whil'd away,
In list'ning to the breaker's roar
That wash the beach at Rockaway.

On old Long Island's sea girt shore
Many an hour I've whil'd away,
In list'ning to the breaker's roar
That wash the beach at Rockaway.

Thansfix'd I've stood while nature's lyre,
In one harmonious concert broke,
And catching its' promethean fire,
My inmost soul to rapture woke, Oh!

On old Long Island's sea girt shore
Many an hour I've whil'd away,
In list'ning to the breaker's roar
That wash the beach at Rockaway.

2.
Oh how delightful 'tis to stroll
Where murmmuring winds and waters meetm
Marking the billows as that roll,
And break [resistieve?] at your feet;

To watch young Iris, as she dips
her mantle in the sparkling dew,
And chas'd by [?] away the trips,
Our [bu-ri-mer's quiv-ring?] blue. Oh!

On old Long Island's sea girt shore
Many an hour I've whil'd away,
In list'ning to the breaker's roar
That wash the beach at Rockaway.

3.
To hear the startling nightwinds sigh
A dreamy twilight lulls to sleep,
While the pale moon reflects from high,
Her image in the mightly deep;

Ma [...?]
