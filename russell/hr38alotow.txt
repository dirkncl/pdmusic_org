1.
A life on the ocean wave!
  A home on the rolling deep!
Where the scatter'd waters rave,
  And the winds their revels keep!
A home on the rolling deep!
  Where the scatter'd waters rave,
And the winds their revels keep!
  Like an eagle cag'd I pine
On this dull unchanging shore,
  Oh give me the flashing brine!
The spray and the tempest's roar!

CHORUS
A life on the ocean wave!
A home on the rolling deep!
Where the scatter'd waters rave,
And the winds their revels keep!
The winds, the winds, the winds their revels keep!
The winds, the winds, the winds their revels keep!

2.
Once more on the deck I stand
  Of my own swift gliding craft;
Set sail! farewell to the land,
  The gale follows fair abaft.
Of my own swift gliding craft --
  Set sail! farewell to the land,
The gale follows fair abaft.
  We shoot through the sparkling foam
Like an ocean bird set free
  Like the ocean bird our home
We'll find far out on the sea.

(CHORUS)

3.
The land is no longer in view,
  The clouds have begun to frown,
But with a stout vessel and crew,
  We'll say, let the storm come down!
And the song of our heart shall be,
  While the winds and waters rave,
A life on heaving sea!
  A home on the bounding wave!
A life on the ocean wave!
  A home on the rolling deep!
Where the scatter'd waters rave,
  And the winds their revels keep!

(CHORUS)
