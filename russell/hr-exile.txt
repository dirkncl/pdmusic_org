The Poetry by Charles Mackay, Esq.
The Music Composed and Sung

1.
O sadly, ye dark rolling waves of the ocean,
O sad-ly ye beat on this desolate shore,
And wake with the voice of your restless commotion
Sad thoughts of the home I must visit no more­­
Sad thoughts of the home I must visit no more.

From the far dis-tant land which has spurn’d me for ever,
The land for whose glory I’ve struggled in vain,
Ye come, O ye winds, but, like me, ye can never,
Oh! never return to behold it again­­
Oh! never return to behold it again.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
O sadly, ye dark rolling waves of the ocean,
O sadly ye beat on this desolate shore,
And wake with the voice of your restless commotion
Sad thoughts of the home I must visit no more,
Sad thoughts of the home I must visit no more.

2.
Thou bird that dost wing thy fair course o’er the billow,
How happy, like thee, all unfetter’d to roam!
Each wave-circled rock can afford thee a pillow;
Each isle of the ocean provide thee a home­­
Each isle of the ocean provide thee a home!

But I must wander in sorrow and sadness,
And stifle the thoughts which forever awake;
Must brood o’er my woes till they drive me to madness,
And teach my proud spirit to bend or to break,
And teach my proud spirit to bend or to break.
