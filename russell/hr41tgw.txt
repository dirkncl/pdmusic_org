"The Gambler's Wife" (1856 [1841?])
A Descriptive Ballad
the Words written by
Dr. R. Coates
The Music Composed
and respectfully dedicated to
Dr. Washington,
By Henry Russell.

  This song is designed to represent the feelings of a young
wife and mother, under circumstances sufficiently common to
warrant the assertion, that is is formulated on fact, without
exaggeration. It represesents the Gambler's wife and child,
deserted by their natural protector, in the extreme of poverty
and starvation, for the pleasure of play.--
  The fire expires; the energies of life sink from want of food,
and the Mother vainly stives to hope in the midst of despair,
appealing to the past with the memory if of the bride, while
vainly endeav'ring to sooth here child with the energy of a
mother's love, until the infant dies in her arms, and her heart
is broken.--The current of her feelings is interrupted only by
the clock, and the third hour, the scene closed, while time
strides onward, in its monotonous march, regardless, as the
world of the issue.

==================
Dark is the night! how dark! no light! no fire!
Cold, on the earth, the last faint spark expire!
Shiv'ring she watches by the cradle side
For him who pledged her love -- last year a Bride!

Hark! -- 'tis his footsteps!
No! -- 'tis past, 'tis gone!
Tic! tic! how wearily the time rolls on.
Why should he leave me thus? he once was kind!
And I believed 'twould last!
Oh! how mad how blind!
Rest thee, my babe! rest on 'tis hunger's cry! 
sleep! for there's no food! the font, the font is dry!
Famine and cold their wear'ing work have done.
My heart must break! and thou! my child! and thou! my child!
Hush! the clock, strikes one.

Hush! 'tis the dice box! yes! he's there! he's there!
For this! he leaves me to despair!
Leaves love! leaves love! his wife! his child! for what?
The wanton's smile -- the villain and the sot!

Yes I'll not curse him, no! 'tis all in vain!
'tis to wait, but sure he'll come again!
And I could starve, and bless him, but for you, my child!
oh, fiend! oh fiend!
Hush the clock strikes two.

Hark! how the sign board creaks!
The blast bowls be.
Moan! moan! ye winds! through the cloudy sky!
Ha! 'tis the knock! he comes once more!
No! 'tis but the lattice flaps! my hope my hope is o'er.

'Tis but the lattice flaps! my hope, my hope is o'er!
my hope, my hope is o'er!

Can he desert us thus! he knows I stay, he knows I stay,
Night after night in loneliness, in loneliness to pray,
For his return, and yet he sees no tear!
no! no! it can not be!
oh! he will be here!

Nestle more closely, dear one, to my heart!
Thou art cold! thou art freezing! but we will not, will not part!
Husband! I die!
Father! it is not he, it is not he!
Oh God! protect my child! oh, God! protect my child!
oh! protect my child!
hush, the clock strikes three.

==================
They're gone, they're gone! the glimmering spark hath fled!
The wife and child are number'd with the dead.
On the cold earth, outstretch'd in solemn rest.
The babe lay frozen on its mother's breast;
The gambler came at last -- but all was o'er
Dread silence reign'd around -- the clock struck four!
