1.
I love the night when the moonstreams bright
On flow'rs that drink the dew,
When cascades shout as the stars peep out,
From boundless fields of blue;
But dearer far than moon or star,
Or flow'rs of gaudy hue,
Or murthring trills of mountain rills,

CHORUS
I love, Mabella, you.
I love, I love, I love, Mabella you,
I love, I love, I love, I love, LOVE you.

2.
I love to stray at the close of day,
Through groves of linden trees,
When gushing notes from songbird's thoats,
Are vocal in the breeze
I love the night the  glorious night:
When hearts beat warm and true
But far above the night, I love

(CHORUS)
