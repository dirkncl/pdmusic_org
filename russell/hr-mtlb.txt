Man the life boat, man the life boat,
Help, or yon ship is lost;
Man the life boat, man the life boat,
See how she's tempest toss'd
Man the life boat, man the life boat,
Help, or yon ship is lost;
Man the life boat, man the life boat,
See how she's tempest toss'd
No human pow'r in such an hour,
The gallant bark can save;
Her main mast gone and hurrying on
she seeks her wat'ry grave,
Man the life boat, man the life boat
See the dreaded signal flies;
Ha! she's struck, and from the rock
Despairing shouts arise.

And one there stands and wrings his hands,
Amidst the Tempest tempest wild;
For on the Beadh he can not reach,
He sees his wife, his wife and child;
For on the Beach he can not reach,
He sees his wife his wife and child;
For on the beach he can not reach,
He sees his wife, his wife and child;
Amids't the tempest wild,
He sees his wife and child.

Life saving ark, yon doomed bark!
Immortal sould doth bearl
Nor gems nor gold, nor wealth untold,
But men, brave men are there.

Oh! speed the life boat speed the life boat
oh God their efforts crown,
She dashes on, the ship is gone;
Full forty fathoms down.

Ah see! the crew are strug'ling now
Amids't amid'st the billows roar
Ah see! the crew are strug'ling now,
Amids't the tempest the tempest roar;
Ah! see! the crew are strug'ling now,
Amids't the tempest the tempest roar.

They're in the Boat! they're all afloat!
Hurrah! they've gain'd the shore.
Bless the life boat, bless the life boat
Oh! God thou'lt hear our pray'rs,
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat!
no longer we'll despair.
