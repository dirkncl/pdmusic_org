"The Spider and the Fly" (1844)
Comic Song As Sung by Mr. Henry Russell
by Henry Russell, 1812-1900

1.
"Will you walk with me to my parlor" said a Spider to a Fly
'Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy.
You have only got ta pop your head within side of the door
You'll see so many curious things you never say before
Will you will you walk to Mister Fly
Will you will you,
Will you will you walk to Mister Fly.

2.
Will you grant me one wish said the spider to the fly;
To taste your charming lips, I've a curiosity
But if perchance our lips should meet, a wager I would lay,
Of ten to one you would not often let them come away.
Will you will you walk in Mister Fly
Will you will you,
Will you will you walk in Mister Fly.

3.
For the last time now I ask you, will you walk in Mister Fly?
No, if I do may I be shot I'm off [and say?] good bye
Then up he springs, but both his wings, were in the web caught fast
The Spider laugh'd Ah! Ah! my boy, I've caught you safe at last.
Will you will you walk out Mister Fly
Will you will you,
Will you, will you, walk out Mister Fly.

4. [MORAL]
Now all you men take warning, by this foolish little Fly,
Pleasure is the Spider's web to catch you it will try,
And althou' you may think that advice is quite a _bore_,
You're lost if you stand parlying, out side of pleasure's door.
Will you will you walk _out_ Mister Fly
Will you will you,
Will you, will you, walk _out_ Mister Fly.
