1.
Let them sing who may,
Of the banquet gay,
When disturb’d is the calm of night
By the dance so free
And the revelry
In pleasure’s wildest height.
Let them blythsome flee
Over land and sea,
O’er mountain and forest roam.
But most dear in my eyes
The pleasures I prize
Are the joys of a happy home.

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
[1.] When
[2.] But
[3.] Then
[ALL]
the cheering light
Of my fireside bright
Oh I hail its genial shine,
Which glows afar
Life a welcoming star
Oh a happy home be mine.

2.
There are some who long
’Mid a merry throng
To wander far away,
From a rock bound strand
To a vine-clad land
From sombre scenes to gay.
And some there be
On the mummuring sea
Who love along to sweep,
With a swelling sail
And an eddying gale
Away o’er the rolling deep.
