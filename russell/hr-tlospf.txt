1.
May ill luck be his only companion,
Who sprung from that sweet spot of Earth.
Oh! this day thro' the world's broad dominion,
Forgets the dear land of his birth,
Whose true children, with tearful emotion,
See alone where e'er they may roam,
With the eyes of their souls o'er the ocean;
The hills and green vallies of home.

CHORUS
For our heart's love is all we can give her
So greet with an Irish Hurrah! Hurrah!
The land of St. Patrick for ever.
In life and death, Erin-go-Bragh!
[Carry Owen]
So a health to all true men whereever they are,
Who respond to his toast with an Irish Hurrah!
While their hearts to the echoes ring Erin-go-Bragh
The land of the shamrock for ever Hurrah!

2.
Like the sea that with constant affection
Encircles her beautiful sphere
In our bosoms the fond recollection,
Life's current surrounds ever more,
And when the cold hand chills its fountains,
Our fading sight turns to the west,
As the sun his last glance on her maintains,
Bestows ere he sinks to his rest:

(CHORUS)
