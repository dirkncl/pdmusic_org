1.
When I rov'd a young highlander, o'er the dark heath,
And climb'd thy steep summit, O Morven of snow!
To gaze on the torrent, that thunder'd beneath,
Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below.
I arose with the dawn, with my dog as my guide,
From mountain to mountain I bounded along;
I breasted the billows of Dee's rushing tide,
And heard at a distance, the Highlander's song,
And heard at a distance the Highlander's song,
When I rov'd a young Highlander, o'er the dark heath;
And climb'd thy steep summit, O Morven of snow;
To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,
Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below.

2.
One image alone, on my bosom imprest,
I lov'd my bleach regions, nor panted for new;
And few were my wants, for my wishes were blest,
And pure were my thoughts, for my soul was with you.
I left my wild home, and my visions are gone,
The mountains are vanish'd, my hope is no more,
As the last of my race, I must wither alone,
And delight but in days I have witness'd before.
And delight but in days I have witness'd before.
When I rov'd, a young Highlander, o'er the dark heath;
And climb'd thy steep summit, O Morven of snow;
To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,
Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below.
