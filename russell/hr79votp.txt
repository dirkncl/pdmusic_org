1.
I remember a dear little cottage,
Adown in a sheltering nook,
As ’twere dropp’d in a bed of sweet blossoms,
Which grew be a wee, tinkling brook;
Ev’ry object around it seems hallow’d,
Where’er o’er this earth I may roam,
Even dearer they seem since I’ve wander’d
Away from that spot,­­ ’twas my Home.

CHORUS [to be sung twice after each verse]
How I loved that sweet vinecover’d cottage.
Of all earth to me ’twas the best;
When lighthearted and gay, ’twas an Eden,
When aweary,­­ a haven of rest.

2.
Years have come, and gone by, each one bringing
Its off’ring of joy or of woe,
For we all must drink equal ofd life’s cup
Of bitter and sweet as we go.
May the River on which floats my lifebarque
Stop awhile in its onward flow,
Till I breathe once again in that homenest,
Then I shall be ready to go.
