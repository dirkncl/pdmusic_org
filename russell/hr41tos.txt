"The Old Sexton" (1841)
Words by Park Benjamin, Esq.
Music composed and respectfully to
William Babcock, Esq.,
by Henry Russell.

1.
Nigh to a grave that was newly made,
Leaned a Sexton old, on his earth worn spade,
His work was done, and he paused to wait,
The fun'ral train through the open gate;
A relic of bygone days was he,
And his locks were white as the foamy sea;
And these words came from his lips so thin,
"I gather them in, I gather them in,
gather, gather, gather,
I gather them in."

2.
"I gather them in! for man and boy,
Year after year of grief and joy;
I've builded the houses that lie around,
In ev'ry nook of this burial ground,
Mother and daughter, father and son,
Come to my solutude, one by one,--
But come they strangers, or come they kin--
"I gather them in, I gather them in,
gather, gather, gather,
I gather them in."

3.
Many are with me, but still I'm alone,
I'm king of the dead--and I make my throne,
On a monument slab of marble cold,
And my sceptre of rule is the spade I hold;
Come they from cottage or come they from hall,
Mankind are my subjects--all, all, all!
Let them loiter in pleasure, or toilfully spin--
"I gather them in, I gather them in,
gather, gather, gather,
I gather them in."

4.
"I gather them in--and their final rest
Is here, down here, in the earth's dark breast!
And the Sexton ceased--for the funeral train
Wound mutely o'er that solemn plain;
And I said to my heart heart--when time is told,
A mightier voice than that sexton's old
Will sound o'er the last tramp's dreadful din--
"I gather them in, I gather them in,
gather, gather, gather,
I gather them in."
