1.
Pull away cheerily,
Not slow or wearily,
Rocking your cradles, boys, fast to and fro;
Working the hand about,
Sifting the sand about,
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.

Rocking your cradles, boys, fast to and fro,
Working the hand about,
Sifting the sand about,
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.

Here's a brave nugget! like children we hug it!
Courage! my lad, fortune favours the bold!
What are our thoughts about,
Knocking the quartz about?
Thoughts that we'll soon send our parents some gold!
So pull away cheerily, ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
Pull away cheerily, fast to and fro;
Working the hand about, ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.

2.
There's Dick a young digger,
Works a cradle much bigger,
Than his own little self,
While Sally she must
Add her mite to the store, by collecting the ore,
And filling her apron with bright yellow dust.

Rocking your cradles, boys, fast to and fro,
Working the hand about,
Sifting the sand about,
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.

Here's a mere manakin, bringing a panikin,
He scarcely can grasp in his small tiny hand,
While tilting his dish up,
We merrily fish up,
Another supply of the glittering sand;
So pull away cheerily, ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
Pull away cheerily fast to and fro;
Working the hand about, ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
Seeking for treasures that lie hid below.
