1.
For full five hundred years
I've swung in my old grep[?] turret high,
And many a different theme I've sung
As the time went stealing by!
I've peal'd the chant of a wedding morn;
Ere night, I have sadly toll'd  (sadly toll'd)
To say that the bride was coming love lorn,
To sleep in the church yard mould!

[CHORUS]
Ding dong,
My ceaseless song, (My song)
Merry or sad, (Farewell now,)
But never long! (And farewell long.)
Ding dong,
My ceaseless song, (My song)
Merry or sad, (Farewell now,)
But never long! (And farewell long.)
Ding (Ding) dong, (dong)
Ding (Ding) dong (dong) ding, (ding,)
Ding dong Bell,
Ding dong Bell,
Ding dong Bell.

2.
For full five hundred years
I've swung in my ancient turret high,
And many a different theme I've sung
As the time went stealing by.
I've swell'd the joy of a country's pride,
For a victory far off won; (victory won)
Then changed to grief for the brave that died,
Ere my mirth had well begun!

(CHORUS)

3.
For full five hundred years
I've swung in my crumbling turret high,
'Tis time my own death song were sung,
And with truth before I die!
I never could love the theme they gave me
My tyrannized tongue to tell; (to tell)
One moment for cradle, the next for grave
They've worn out the old church bell.

(CHORUS)
