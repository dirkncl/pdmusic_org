1.
Oh! brothers, come hither, and list to my story
Merry and brief will the narrative be
Here, like a monarch, I reign in my glory---
Master am I, boys, of all that I see.

Where once frown'd a forest, a garden is smiling
The meadows and moorlands are marshes no more;
And there curls the smoke of my cottage, beguiling
The children who cluster like grapes at the door,
Then enter boys; cheerly, boys, enter and rest;
The land of the heart is the land of the west.
O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho!

2.
Talk not of the town, boys---give me the broad prairie,
Where man like the wind roams impulsive and free;
Behold how its beautiful colours all vary,
Like those of the clouds, or the deep rolling sea.

A life in the woods, boys, is ever as changing;
With proud independence we measure our cheer,
And those who the world are for happiness ranging,
Won't find it at all if they don't find it here.
Then enter boys; cheerly, boys, enter and rest;
The land of the heart is the land of the west.
O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho!

3.
Here, brothers, secure from all turmoil and danger,
We reap what we sow, for the soil is our own;
We spread hospitality's bread for the stranger,
And care not a fig for the King on his throne.

We never know want, far we live by our labour,
And in it contentment and happiness find;
We do what we can for a friend or a neighbor,
And die, boys, in peace and good will to mankind.
Then enter boys, cheerly, boys, enter and rest;
The land of the heart is the land of the west.
O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho, boys! O-ho!
