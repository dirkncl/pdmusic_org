1.
Heigh ho! for a husband! Heigh ho!
There's danger in longer delay!
Shall I never again have a beau?
Will nobody marry me, pray?
I begin to feel strange, I declare!
With beauty my prospects will fade!
I'd give myself up in despair
If I though I should die an old maid!

CHORUS
Heigh ho! for a husband! Heigh ho!
Will nobody marry me say!
Will nobody? nobody? No.
Will nobody? nobody? No.

2.
I once put the beaus in a huff!
I thought it a sin and a shame
That no one had spirit enough
To ask me to alter my name!
So I turn'd up my nose at the short,
And roll'd up my eyes at the tall;
But then I just did it in sport,
And now I've no lover at all!

(CHORUS)

3.
These men are the plague of my life!
'Tis hard from so many to choose!
Should any one wish for a wife
Could I have the heart to refuse?
I don't have for none have proposed
Oh dear me! I'm frighten'd I vow!
Good gracious! whoever supposed!
That I should be single till now.

(CHORUS)
