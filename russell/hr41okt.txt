1.
I wear not the purple of earthborn kings,
Nor the stately crownime[?] of lordly things:
But monach and courtier, though great they be,
Must fall from their glory and bend to me,
But moarch and courtier though great they be,
Must fall from their glory and bend to me,
My sceptre is gemless; yet who can say
They will not come under its mighty sway!
Ye may learn who I am, there's the passing chime,
and the dial to herald me.
Old King Time! Ha! Ha!
Old King Time! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Old King Time,
Ha! Ha! Ha!

2.
Softly I creep, like a thief at night,
After checks all blooming and eyes all light:
My steps are seen on the patriach's brow,
On the deep brown furrows and lock of snow,
My steps are seen on the Patriarch's brow,
On the deep worn furrows and locks of snow,
Who laughs at my power! The young and the gay,
But they dream not how closely I track their way,
Wait till their first bright sands have run,
And they will not smile at what Time hath done,
Ha! Ha! Old King Time
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Old King Time
Ha! Ha! Ha!

3.
I eat through the treasures with moth and rust;
I lay the georgeous palace of dust;
I make the shell proof tow'r my own,
And break the battlement stone by stone,
I make the shell proof tow'r my own
And break the battlement stone by stone,
Work on your cities and temples, proud man.
Build high as ye may,
And strong as ye can,
But the marble shall crumble, the pillars shall fall,
And Time, Old Time, will be King after all,
Ha! Ha! Old King Time
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Old King Time Ha! Ha! Ha!
