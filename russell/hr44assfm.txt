1.
Some love to stroll where the wassail-bowl
  And the wine-cups circle free;
None of all that band e're shall win my hand:
  No --- a sober spouse for me.

Where the wine-cups circle free:
  None of all that band e[']re shall win my hand:
No --- a sober spouse for me.

Like cheerful streams when the morning beams
  With him my life should flow.
Not down the crags the drunkard drags
  His wife for shame and wo.
Not down the crags the drunkard drags
  His wife for shame and wo.

No! no! no! no!
no! no! no! no!
no! no! no!

Some love to stroll where the wassail-bowl
  And the wine-cups circle free; ---
None of all that band e[']re shall win my hand:
  No! a sober spouse for me
  No--a sober spouse for me.
  No--a sober spouse for me.

2.
The drunkard mark, at midnight dark---
  Oh what a sight good bark!
From fumes of beer and wine appear
  Grim friends who cross his track;

His children's name he dooms to shame---
  His wife to want and wo;
She is betrayed for wine is made
  Her rival and her foe.

No! no! no! no!
no! no! no! no!
no! no! no!

Still some wife stroll, where the wassail-bowl
  And the wine-cups circle free;
None of all that band e're shall win my hand:
  No--a sober spouse for me---
  No--a sober spouse for me.
  No--a sober spouse for me.
