1.
Oh why does the white man follow my path,
Like the hound on the tiger's track,
Does the flush on my dark cheek waken his wrath,
Does he covet the bow of my back,

Like the hound on the tiger's track;
Does the flush on my dark cheek waken his wrath,
Does he covet the bow at my back.
He has rivers and seas where the billows and breeze,
Rear the riches for him alone;
And the sons[?] of the wood never plunge in the flood,
Which the white man calls his own.
Vha ...
Then why should he come to the streams where none,
But the red skin dare to swim;
Why why should he wrong the hunter one,
who never did harm to him.

CHORUS
Vha ... yha ... yha ... yha ...
yha yha ... yha ... yha ... yha ... yha ...

2.
The Father above thought fit to give,
The whiteman corn and wine;
There are golden fields where they may live,
But the Forest shades are mine.

The whiteman corn and wine;
There are golden fields where they may live,
But the Forest shades are mine.
The Eagle hath its place of rest,
The wild horse where to dwell;
And the spirit that gave the bird its nest,
Made me a home as well,
Yha ...
Then back go back from the red man's track,
For the hunters eyes grow dim.
To find the white man wrongs the one
Who never did harm to him.

(CHORUS)
