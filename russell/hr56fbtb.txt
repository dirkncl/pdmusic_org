Plate No. 18142

1.
Fresh blows the breeze, the sun is brightly shining,
Care all has fled boys, hope for new success;
Faint grows the heart that cea-ses not repining,
Leaving our country, we love it none the less.
Spread full the sails, our land is fading fast,
Still though we linger o’er each vanish’d scene;
Tell not the tale of griefs that now are past,
Breathe not the wish to be as we have been.

[REFRAIN] [sung after each verse]
Oh! speed well our ship, the sun is brightly shining,
Care all has fled boys, hope for new success;
Faint grows the heart that cea-ces not repining,
Leaving our country, we love it none the less!

2. 
Hope is our sun, our darlings yet shall meet us
This be the end boys, toil by day and night;
Yet once again for those we love to greet us,
Friends of our youth, oh! we’ll fight a gallant fight;
Though mem’ry’s voice some pleasant dreams recalling,
Farewell to home is charm’d from its despair;
Life shall no longer prove a weary calling,
Stout hearts no more be doom’d to ill and care:
