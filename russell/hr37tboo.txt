1.
A song of the Oak the brave old Oak,
Who hath rul'd in the greenwood long,
Here's health and renown to his broad green crown,
And his fifty arms so strong!
There is 
[missing from source]
hundred years are gone.

2.
He saw the rare times, when the christmas chimes
Were a merry sound to hear,
And the squire's wide hall and the Cottage small,
Were full of American cheer;
And all the day to the [reheck?] gay,
They frolicked with loathsome swaines,
They are gone they are dead, in the church yard laid,
But the tree he still remains
Then sing to the Oak the brave old Oak
Who hath rul'd in this land so long
And still flourish he a hale greentree
When a hundred years are gone.
