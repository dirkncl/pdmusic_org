1.
On the brave who have fallen no tear we bestow,
Remov’d from a world of oppression and woe,
It is better to die as they died that live on,
When the hope that supports us forever is gone.
On the brave who have fallen no tear we bestow,
Remov’d from a world of oppression and woe.

2.
O’er the actions of those who unshrinking could sell,
Their freedom so dearly, enraptur’d we dwell,
And altho’ unsuccessful the Patriots that roam,
Shall be warmly receiv’d in our own Island home,
And altho’ unsuccessful the Patriots that roam,
Shall be warmly receiv’d in our own Island home.

3.
It is here that the spirit can swell uncontroll’d,
It is here that high thoughts need not perish untold
And a hand for a friend, or a sword for a foe,
Is a gift that the poorest hath pow’r to bestow.
And a hand for a friend, or a sword for a foe,
Is a gift that the poorest hath pow’r to bestow.

4.
We have mourned for the vanquished, we mourn for the brave,
Should ever encounter a premature grave,
But oh! not for those only who fell is the stain
Of our tears will unwiped but for them who remain.
But oh! not for those only who fell is the stain
Of our tears will unwiped but for them who remain.
