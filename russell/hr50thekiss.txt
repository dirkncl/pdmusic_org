1.
A Kiss I’d dearly love to have,
’Tis only one I ask
The soft enchantment of but one,
Will be a charming task;
A tear now gleams in Clara’s eye,
E’en that I’ll kiss away,
Before the gem falls to the earth,
And breaks its gentle ray.

2.
A Kiss is but a little thing,
Yet it is priz’d most dear,
There's magic lies in ev’ry one,
A Love-barb too I fear.
How often has a kiss been known,
To seal a youthful love;
More firmly than a sacred vow,
Enshrin'd in realms above.

3.
And what is sweeter than a kiss?
Not angels will disown.
Those smiling lips the poets sing,
Like roses newly blown.
These send a shrill deep to the heart,
As lovers all can tell;
Then maidens who would feeling wake,
Exert the golden spell.
