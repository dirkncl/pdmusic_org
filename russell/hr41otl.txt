1.
Oh! this love, this love!
I once the passion slighted;
But hearts but hearts that truely love
Must break or be united!

CHORUS
Oh! this love! Oh! this love!
Oh! this love! Oh! this love!
Oh! this love!
Oh! this love!

2.
When first he come to woo
I little cared about him,
But soon but soon I felt as though
I could not live without him!

(CHORUS)

3.
He gave to me the ring,
My hand ask'd of my mother,
I could not could not bear the thought
That he would wed another!

(CHORUS)

4.
And now I'm all his own,
In all his joys I mingle;
Not for the wealth the wealth of worlds
Would I again be single!

(CHORUS)
