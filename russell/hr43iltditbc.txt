1.
I love to dwell in the bosom's cell,
Where I weave a firy spell:
Where love's bright beam, lights fancy's dream,
Fair and soft as moonlight gleam.
I love to rise in fancy's skies,
The bright glance of beauty's eyes:
'Tis sweet to see,
When the heart is free,
The smiles, the smiles they shed on me,
Oh! I love to dwell in the bosom's cell,
Where I weave a fairy spell;
And 'tis sweet to see, when the heart is free,
The smiles, the smiles they shed on me.

2.
Oh! what care I for tear or sigh,
I cheer the heart and light the eye;
I love to weave, o'er those who grieve,
A ray of hope, which all believe;
I love to dwell in the bosm's cell,
To weave around my fairy spell,
'Tis sweet to see, when the heart is free,
The smiles that welcome me.
Oh! what care I fr tear or sigh,
I cheer the heart and light the eye;
And 'tis sweet to see, when the heart is free,
The smiles that welcome me.

3.
I love to shed o'er the lover's head,
The darling hopes his fancy spred;
To sorrow's dart I a balm impart,
A wreath of peace for the gentle heart,
I love to dwell in the bosom's cell,
To weave my wreath, and breathe my spell;
'Tis sweet to see, when the heart is free,
The smiles, the smiles that welcome me.
Oh! what care I for a tear or sigh,
I cheer the heart and light the eye;
And 'tis sweet to see, when the heart is free,
The smiles, the smiles that welcome me.
