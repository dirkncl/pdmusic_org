1.Blow blow wild winds blow, for our course we値l pur-sue
Ca-pri-cious old Bo-reas, un-sha-ken by you,
Ca-pri-cious old Bo-reas un-sha-ken, un-sha-ken by you.

And if with ill na-ture you mut-ter and growl,
Why we値l still keep our way and sing while you howl!

CHORUS [sung after each verse]
So if with ill na-ture, you mut-ter and growl,
Why we値l still keep our way and sing while you howl
Why we値l still keep our way and sing while you howl

Why we値l still keep our way, and sing, and sing while you howl,
Why we値l still keep our way,
And sing, and sing while you howl.

2.Blow blow and un-fur-ling our sails to the gate,
Itshall waft us a-long aso弾r o-cean we sail,
Itshall waft us a-long as o弾r o-cean o弾r o-cean we sail.

We値l out strip the breeze and we値l buf-fet the blast,
And like mer-ry mer-ry mer-ry Mar-in-ers sing to the last.
