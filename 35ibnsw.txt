1.I値l be no submissive wife
No not I no not I
I値l not be a slave for life
No not I no not I
I値l be no submissive wife
No not I no not I

I値l not be a slave for life
No not I no not I.
Think you on a wedding day
That I said as others say
Love and honor and obey
Love and honor and obey
no no no no no no no no no not I
Love and honor and obey
Love and honor and obey
no no no
no no no
no no no not I
no no no
no no no
no no no not I
no no no
no no no
no no no no not I.

2.I to dullness don稚 incline
No not I no not I
Go to bed at half past nine
No not I no not I
I to dullness don稚 incline
No not I no not I
Go to bed at half past nine
No not I no not I.

Should a humdrum husband say
That at home I ought to stay
Do you think that I値l obey
Do you think that I値l obey
no no no
no no no
no no no not I
Do you think that I値l obey
Do you think that I値l obey
no no no
no no no
no no no not I
no no no
no no no
no no no not I
no no no
no no no
no no no no not I.
