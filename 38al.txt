"Annie Laurie" (1838)
Scotch Ballad
Sung by Jenny Lind, 1820-1887
Arranged by Finley Dun, 1795-1853

1.
Max-welton braes are bonnie,
  Where early fa's the dew,
And it's there that Annie Laurie
  Gie'd me her promise true;
Gied me her promise true,
  Which ne'er forgot will be,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
  I'd lie me doune and dee.

2.
Her brow is like the snaw drift
  Her throat is like the swan;
Her face it is the fairest
  That e'er the sun shone on.
That e'er the sun shone on,
  And dark blue is her e'er;
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
  I'd lay lay me doune and dee.

3.
Like dew on the gowan lying
  Is the fa' o' her fairy feet;
And like winds in summer sighing,
  Her voice is low and sweet.
Her voice is low and sweet
  And she is a' the world to me,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
  I'd lay we doune and dee.
